 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 We have included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and from time to time may make in our public filings, press releases or other public statements, certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements. In addition, our management may make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and represent only MSCI s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or continue, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Statements concerning our financial position, business strategy and plans or objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Such risks and uncertainties include those set forth under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024. If any of these risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or if MSCI s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what MSCI projected. Any forward-looking statement reflects our current views with respect to future events, levels of activity, performance or achievements and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the time they are made and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. MSCI assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Therefore, readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports or documents we file from time to time with the SEC.

 interest in The Burgiss Group, LLC Burgiss for million in cash (the step acquisition ). The Company s existing interest in Burgiss had a fair value at acquisition date of million which resulted in a non-taxable gain of million which the Company recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2023. The acquisition of Burgiss provides the Company with comprehensive data and deep expertise in private assets, enabling investors to evaluate fundamental information, measure and compare performance, understand exposures, manage risk, and conduct robust analytics. 
 The step acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting and its results are reported within the Private Capital Solutions operating segment within the All Other Private Assets reportable segment. With the step acquisition, the Company renamed the Burgiss operating segment to Private Capital Solutions. Prior to the step acquisition, Burgiss was accounted for as an equity-method investment. Therefore, MSCI did not recognize the proportionate share of Burgiss operating revenues, rather, the Company s proportionate share of the income or loss of Burgiss was reported as a component of other (expense) income, net. A portion of Burgiss s client agreements do not have automatic renewal clauses at the end of the subscription period. Due to the historically high retention rate, the expectation that a substantial portion of the client agreements will be renewed and the nature of the subscription service, the associated revenue is recorded as recurring subscription revenue.

 The Company, with the assistance of third-party valuation experts, calculated the fair values of intangible assets using the relief from royalty method for proprietary data, acquired technology and software and trademarks and the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included forecasted cash flows, which were determined based on certain assumptions that included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rates, technology obsolescence rates and discount rates. The weighted average amortization period of the acquired intangible assets was years. 
 The recorded goodwill is primarily attributable to the expected synergies from the utilization of the acquired data as well as expanded market opportunities. Goodwill attributable to the acquisition is deductible for federal income tax purposes to the extent of consideration paid. 
 Revenue of Burgiss recognized within the consolidated financial statements was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 On November 1, 2023, MSCI completed the acquisition of Trove Research Ltd Trove ), a carbon markets intelligence provider. Trove is a part of the ESG and Climate operating segment.

Fabric ), a wealth technology platform specializing in portfolio design, customization and analytics for wealth managers and advisors. Fabric is a part of the Analytics operating segment.

 On April 16, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Foxberry Ltd. Foxberry ), a front-office index technology platform. Foxberry is a part of the Index operating segment. The contingent consideration related to Foxberry is payable based upon the achievement of integration metrics related to the operation of the platform. 
 The Company recognizes the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of acquisition. The liability associated with any contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date subsequent to the acquisition and changes in the fair value are recorded in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

 The fair values of the contingent consideration were determined based on management estimates and assumptions which primarily include forecasted product sales, probability of achievement of certain integration targets and discount rates.

As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration was million, of which million is included in Other accrued liabilities and million is included in Other non-current liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.

On January 26, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), amending and restating in its entirety the Company s prior Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement ).

The tax years currently under or open to examination vary by jurisdiction but include years from 2008 onwards. 
 The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it files income tax returns. The Company has established unrecognized tax benefits that the Company believes are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Company adjusts unrecognized tax benefits only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change.

 operating segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions, which are presented as the following reportable segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate and All Other Private Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company renamed the Burgiss operating segment to Private Capital Solutions. The operating segments of Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions do not individually meet the segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of All Other Private Assets reportable segment. 
 The Index operating segment offers equity and fixed income indexes. The indexes are used in many areas of the investment process, including for developing indexed financial products (e.g., Exchange Traded Funds ETFs ), mutual funds, annuities, futures, options, structured products and over-the-counter derivatives), performance benchmarking, portfolio construction and rebalancing, and asset allocation. 
 The Analytics operating segment offers risk management, performance attribution and portfolio management content, applications and services that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return and tools for analyzing market, credit, liquidity, counterparty and climate risk across all major asset classes, spanning short-, medium- and long-term time horizons. Clients access Analytics tools and content through MSCI s proprietary applications and application programming interfaces, third-party applications or directly through their own platforms. Additionally, the Analytics operating segment also provides various managed services to help clients operate more efficiently, including consolidation of client portfolio data from various sources, review and reconciliation of input data and results, and customized reporting. 
 The ESG and Climate operating segment offers products and services that help institutional investors understand how ESG and climate considerations can impact the long-term risk and return of their portfolio and individual security-level investments. In addition, the ESG and Climate operating segment provides data, ratings, research and tools to help investors navigate increasing regulation, meet new client demands and better integrate ESG and climate elements into their investment processes. 
 The Real Assets operating segment offers data, benchmarks, return-analytics, climate assessments and market insights for tangible assets such as real estate and infrastructure. In addition, Real Assets performance and risk analytics range from enterprise-wide to property-specific analysis. The Real Assets operating segment also provides business intelligence products to real estate owners, managers, developers and brokers worldwide. 
 Prior to the step acquisition of Burgiss on October 2, 2023, the Company s ownership interest in Burgiss was classified as an equity-method investment. Therefore, prior to the acquisition of Burgiss, the All Other Private Assets segment did not include the Company s proportionate share of operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA related to Burgiss. The Company s proportionate share of the income or loss from its equity-method investment in Burgiss was not a component of Adjusted EBITDA as it was reported as a component of other (expense) income, net. Following the acquisition, the consolidated results of Burgiss were included in the Company s Private Capital Solutions operating segment. 
 The Private Capital Solutions operating segment offers a suite of tools to help private asset investors across mission-critical workflows, such as sourcing terms and conditions, evaluating operating performance of underlying portfolio companies, managing risk and other activities supporting private capital investing. 
 The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM measures and evaluates reportable segments based on segment operating revenues as well as Adjusted EBITDA and other measures. The Company excludes the following items from segment Adjusted EBITDA: provision for income taxes, other expense (income), net, depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs, that the CODM does not consider for the purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or to assess segment performance. Although these amounts are excluded from segment Adjusted EBITDA, they are included in reported consolidated net income and are included in the reconciliation that follows.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Form 10-K. 
 Except as the context otherwise indicates, the terms MSCI, the Company, we, our and us refer to MSCI Inc., together with its subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of critical decision support tools and solutions for the global investment community. Our mission-critical offerings help investors address the challenges of a transforming investment landscape and power better investment decisions. Leveraging our knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research, data and technology, we enable our clients to understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return and confidently and efficiently build more effective portfolios. The Company has five operating segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions (formerly Burgiss), which are presented as the following four reportable segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate and All Other Private Assets. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we renamed the The Burgiss Group, LLC Burgiss operating segment to Private Capital Solutions. The operating segments of Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions do not individually meet the segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of the All Other Private Assets reportable segment. 
 Our growth strategy includes: (a) extending leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes, (b) leading the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration, (c) enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology, (d) expanding solutions that empower client customization, (e) strengthening client relationships and growing into strategic partnerships with clients and (f) executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary data, content and technology companies. For more information about our Company s operations, see Item 1: Business in our Form 10-K. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we served approximately 6,900 1 clients in more than 95 countries. 
 Our principal business model is generally to license annual, recurring subscriptions for the majority of our Index, Analytics and ESG and Climate products and services for a fee due in advance of the service period. Private Assets products are also licensed annually through subscriptions, which are generally recurring, for a fee which is paid either in advance when products are generally delivered ratably over the subscription period or in arrears after the product is delivered. A portion of our fees comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for index-linked investment products. Such fees are primarily based on a client s assets under management AUM ), trading volumes and fee levels. 
 In evaluating our financial performance, we focus on revenue and profit growth. This includes evaluating results based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), as well as non-GAAP measures, for the Company as a whole and by operating segment. 
 We present revenues disaggregated by types and by segments, which represent our major product lines. We also review expenses by activity, which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed. In addition, we utilize operating metrics including Run Rate, subscription sales and Retention Rate to manage and assess performance and to provide deeper insights into the recurring portion of our business. 
 In the discussion that follows, we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period. While operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes asset-based fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the underlying AUM, which is the primary component of asset-based fees, is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately three-fifths of the AUM is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and accordingly, any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency-adjusted variances.

 A material portion of our revenues is concentrated in some of our largest clients. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our largest client organization by revenue, BlackRock, accounted for 10.1 of our consolidated operating revenues. 96.1 of the operating revenues from BlackRock come from fees based on the assets in BlackRock s ETFs and non-ETF products that are based on our indexes. 
 The discussion of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. 
 
 Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results 
 Acquisitions of Burgiss, Trove, Fabric and Foxberry 
 On October 2, 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 66.4 interest in Burgiss for 696.8 million in cash. The Company s existing 33.6 interest had a fair value at acquisition date of 353.2 million which resulted in a non-taxable gain of 143.0 million for the three months ending December 31, 2023. 
 Prior to the acquisition, the Company s ownership interest in Burgiss was classified as an equity-method investment. Therefore, the All Other Private Assets segment did not include the Company s proportionate share of operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA related to Burgiss. The Company s proportionate share of the income or loss from its equity-method investment in Burgiss was reported as a component of other (expense) income, net. 
 Following the acquisition, the consolidated results of Burgiss are included in the Company s Private Capital Solutions operating segment (formerly known as Burgiss), which is combined and presented as part of the All Other Private Assets reportable segment. See Note 5, Acquisitions, and Note 12, Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on the acquisition of Burgiss. 
 On November 1, 2023, MSCI completed the acquisition of Trove Research Ltd Trove ), a carbon markets intelligence provider for approximately 37.5 million in cash. Trove is a part of the ESG and Climate operating segment. 
 On January 2, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Fabric RQ, Inc. Fabric ), a wealth technology platform specializing in portfolio design, customization and analytics for wealth managers and advisors for approximately 8.0 million in cash and contingent consideration with an acquisition date fair value of 8.1 million that is payable based on future sales of Fabric s products. Fabric is a part of the Analytics operating segment. 
 On April 16, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Foxberry Ltd. Foxberry ), a front-office index technology platform for approximately 23.5 million in cash and contingent consideration with an acquisition date fair value of 19.1 million that is payable based upon the achievement of metrics related to the operation of the platform. Foxberry is a part of the Index operating segment. We collectively refer to the acquisitions of Burgiss, Trove, Fabric and Foxberry as the recent acquisitions . 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1, Introduction and Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in our accounting policies since the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 or critical accounting estimates applied in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except as described below. 
 Goodwill 
 We recognize goodwill in business combination transactions when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the acquired net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 or when interim triggers arise. The test for impairment was performed at the reporting unit level, and we used an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. 
 The income approach requires significant judgement in estimating future cash flows, including assumptions, amongst others, about revenue growth rates and operating margins, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which reflects the reporting unit s cost of capital. Forecasted future cash flows are estimated based on a combination of historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. Discount rates are selected for each reporting unit being valued based on each reporting unit s estimated weighted-average cost of capital. The weighted-average cost of capital is estimated based on both the capital structure that we believe a market participant would utilize as well as the discount rates of guideline public companies that have similar characteristics to each reporting unit being valued, adjusted for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. Terminal growth rates are selected based on growth rates used during the reporting unit s forecast period in combination with economic conditions. The market approach utilizes valuation multiples of revenue and cash flows derived from guideline public companies that have similar characteristics to each reporting unit being valued. Selecting appropriate guideline companies, valuation multiples and other key 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 assumptions such as revenue growth rates and discount rates requires significant management judgment, and changes to these estimates could materially impact the fair value determination of each reporting unit. We perform sensitivity analyses around key assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the impact on the estimated fair value. 
 Impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value. As of July 1, 2024, all reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values. As a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded as of this date. 
 
 We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2024 on our Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units, which are also our operating segments. As of July 1, 2024, the fair value of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of goodwill within the Private Capital Solutions reporting unit was 617.8 million. As of July 1, 2024, and given the recent step acquisition of Burgiss on October 2, 2023, the fair value of the Private Capital Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 , making it vulnerable to potential future impairment. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, the performance of one or more of our recently acquired companies or reporting units, or our common stock price, or if economic conditions differ significantly from management s assumptions, our goodwill could be impaired in the future, which may be material to our results of operations and financial position. 
 For all of our reporting units, individually, a hypothetical decrease in revenue growth rates by 100 basis points or a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in an impairment. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 Our operating revenues are grouped by the following types: recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring. We also group operating revenues by major product or reportable segment as follows: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, and All Other Private Assets .

 Compensation and Benefits 
 A significant portion of the incentive compensation component of operating expenses is based on the achievement of a number of financial and operating metrics. In a scenario where operating revenue growth and profitability moderate, incentive compensation would be expected to decrease accordingly. 
 We had 6,118 employees as of September 30, 2024, compared to 5,005 employees as of September 30, 2023, reflecting a 22.2 growth in the number of employees which is primarily related to recent acquisitions. Continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs. As of September 30, 2024, 68.5 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 66.5 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Compensation and benefits costs increased 13.4 and 17.2 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by an increase in wages and salaries, incentive compensation and benefits costs due to headcount growth, partially offset by

 increased capitalization of expenses related to internally developed software projects. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and recent acquisitions, compensation and benefits costs would have increased by 2.7 and increased by 6.1 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-Compensation Expenses 
 Fixed costs constitute a significant portion of the non-compensation component of operating expenses. The discretionary non-compensation component of operating expenses could, however, be reduced in the near-term in a scenario where operating revenue growth moderates. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased 20.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, driven by higher professional fees, market data costs, information technology, marketing costs, transaction and integration costs related to recent acquisitions and recruiting costs. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased 16.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by higher professional fees, information technology, transaction and integration costs related to recent acquisitions, market data costs and travel and entertainment costs. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and recent acquisitions, non-compensation expenses would have increased by 8.5 and increased by 6.1 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definite-lived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and capitalization of internally developed software projects recognized over their estimated useful lives. 
 Amortization of intangible assets expense increased 56.9 and 56.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher amortization recognized on acquired intangible assets from recent acquisitions 
 and higher amortization of internal use software. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization of Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements 
 Depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of computer and related equipment, leasehold improvements, software and furniture and fixtures over the estimated useful life of the assets. 
 Depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements decreased 17.5 and 20.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by lower depreciation on computer and related equipment.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA expenses, a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA expenses and Adjusted EBITDA margin are believed to be meaningful measures for management to assess the operating performance of the Company because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the Company s ongoing operating performance in the period. All companies do not calculate adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses and adjusted EBITDA margin in the same way. These measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. Accordingly, the Company s computation of the Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies. 
 The following table presents non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operating revenues 724,705 625,439 15.9 2,112,619 1,838,814 14.9 Adjusted EBITDA expenses 274,003 239,150 14.6 848,389 730,490 16.1 Adjusted EBITDA 450,702 386,289 16.7 1,264,230 1,108,324 14.1 Operating margin 55.4 56.5 53.2 55.1 Adjusted EBITDA margin 62.2 61.8 59.8 60.3 
 The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects changes in the rate of growth of Adjusted EBITDA expenses as compared to the rate of growth of operating revenues, driven by the factors previously described.

 Operating Metrics 
 Run Rate 
 Run Rate estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements Client Contracts for the next 12 months, assuming all Client Contracts that come up for renewal, or reach the end of the committed subscription period, are renewed and assuming then-current currency exchange rates, subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below. For any Client Contract where fees are linked to an investment product s assets or trading volume/fees, the Run Rate calculation reflects, for ETFs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-ETF products, the most recent client-reported assets. Run Rate does not include fees associated with one-time and other non-recurring transactions. In addition, we add to Run Rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute Client Contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date. We remove from Run Rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any Client Contract when we (i) have received a notice of termination, non-renewal or an indication the client does not intend to continue their subscription during the period and (ii) have determined that such notice evidences the client s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such termination or non-renewal may not be effective until a later date. 
 Changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in Run Rate. The actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from Run Rate for numerous reasons, including: 
 fluctuations in revenues associated with new recurring sales; 
 modifications, cancellations and non-renewals of existing Client Contracts, subject to specified notice requirements; 
 differences between the recurring license start date and the date the Client Contract is executed due to, for example, contracts with onboarding periods or fee waiver periods; 
 fluctuations in asset-based fees, which may result from changes in certain investment products total expense ratios, market movements, including foreign currency exchange rates, or from investment inflows into and outflows from investment products linked to our indexes; 
 fluctuations in fees based on trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes; 
 price changes or discounts; 
 revenue recognition differences under U.S. GAAP, including those related to the timing of implementation and report deliveries for certain of our products and services; 
 fluctuations in the number of hedge funds for which we provide investment information and risk analysis to hedge fund investors; 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and 
 the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.

 Total Run Rate increased 17.3 , driven by a 15.0 increase from recurring subscriptions and a 25.3 increase from asset-based fees. Adjusting for the impact of recent acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, recurring subscriptions Run Rate would have increased 8.0 . 
 Run Rate from Index recurring subscriptions increased 8.6 , primarily driven by growth from market cap-weighted and custom Index products and special packages. The increase reflected growth across all regions. Adjusting for the impact of the acquisition of Foxberry and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Index Run Rate would have increased 8.5 . 
 Run Rate from Index asset-based fees increased 25.3 , primarily driven by higher AUM in both ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes. 
 Run Rate from Analytics products increased 8.1 , primarily driven by growth in both Multi-Asset Class and Equity Analytics products, and reflected growth across all regions and client segments. Adjusting for the impact of the acquisition of Fabric and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Analytics Run Rate would have increased 7.1 . 
 Run Rate from ESG and Climate products increased 15.7 , driven by strong growth in Ratings, Climate and Screening products with contributions across all regions and client segments. Adjusting for the impact of the acquisition of Trove and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, ESG and Climate Run Rate would have increased 11.2 . 
 Run Rate from All Other - Private Assets increased 78.2 , and included 110.1 million associated with Burgiss. Excluding the impact of the step acquisition of Burgiss, the growth was primarily driven by Index Intel products. Adjusting for the impact of the step acquisition of Burgiss and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other - Private Assets Run Rate would have increased 2.4 . 
 
 Sales 
 Sales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from MSCI and will result in additional operating revenues. Non-recurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of Run Rate. New recurring subscription sales represent additional selling activities, such as new customer agreements, additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to Run Rate. Subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period, such as discontinuing products and services and/or

 Retention Rate

 94.2 95.4 93.9 95.4 
 ___________________________ 
 (1) Retention rate for Index excluding the impact of the acquisition of Foxberry was 95.5 and 94.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Retention rate for Analytics excluding the impact of the acquisition of Fabric was 93.8 and 94.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Retention rate for ESG and Climate excluding the impact of the acquisition of Trove was 93.4 and 92.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Retention rate for All Other Private Assets excluding the impact of the step acquisition of Burgiss was 92.2 and 90.7 for the three and nine months and year ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Total retention rate excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Foxberry, Fabric, Trove, and Burgiss was 94.4 and 94.0 for three and nine months and year ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Retention Rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. The annual Retention Rate represents the retained subscription Run Rate (subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year) as a percentage of the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
 The Retention Rate for a non-annual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew or discontinue the subscription during the non-annual period, and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement, even though such termination or non-renewal may not be effective until a later date. This annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate. This cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized Retention Rate for the period. 
 Retention Rate is computed by operating segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. In general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our Retention Rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. In those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancel. In the Analytics and the ESG and Climate operating segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our Index and Real Assets operating segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances. In addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-sell of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. We do not calculate Retention Rate for that portion of our Run Rate attributable to assets in index-linked investment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes. 
 Retention Rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We require capital to fund ongoing operations, internal growth initiatives and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facility. In addition, we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets. We intend to use these sources of liquidity to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and dividend payments, and make repurchases of our common stock. In connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. We believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth. 
 Senior Notes and Credit Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 4,200.0 million in Senior Notes outstanding. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, we had as of September 30, 2024 an aggregate of 311.9 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. See Note 8, Debt and Note 13, Subsequent Events , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included herein for additional information on our outstanding indebtedness and revolving credit facility. 
 On January 26, 2024, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement amending and restating in its entirety the Prior Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement makes available an aggregate of 1,250.0 million of revolving loan commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, which may be drawn until January 26, 2029. The Revolving Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement was drawn at closing in an amount sufficient to prepay all term loans outstanding under the TLA Facility under the Prior Credit Agreement. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are general unsecured obligations of the Company. 
 The Senior Notes and the Prior Credit Agreement were previously fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by our direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5 of our and our subsidiaries consolidated assets, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the subsidiary guarantors ). Upon the closing of the Credit Agreement on January 26, 2024, the subsidiary guarantors were released from their guarantees under the Prior Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our Senior Notes (the Indentures ). 
 The Indentures among us and Computershare, National Association, as trustee and successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, contain covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur certain indebtedness. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur certain indebtedness. 
 The Credit Agreement and the Indentures also contain customary events of default, including those relating to non-payment, breach of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-default and cross-acceleration, and bankruptcy and insolvency events, and, in the case of the Credit Agreement, invalidity or impairment of loan documentation, change of control and customary ERISA defaults in addition to the foregoing. None of the restrictions detailed above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business. 
 The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the Credit Agreement: (1) the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis not to exceed 4.25:1.00 (or 4.50:1.00 for four fiscal quarters following a material acquisition) and (2) the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis of at least 4.00:1.00. As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was 2.39:1.00 and our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio was 9.79:1.00.

 As of September 30, 2024, there was 405.4 million of available authorization remaining under the 2022 Repurchase Program. This authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. 
 Cash Dividends 
 On October 28, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 1.60 per share for the three months ending December 31, 2024. The fourth quarter 2024 dividend is payable on November 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on November 15, 2024.

 500,979 461,693 
 We typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately 225.0 million to 275.0 million for general operating purposes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 244.0 million and 285.2 million, respectively, of the Company s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. Repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions. We believe the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purposes or other needs, including acquisitions or expansion of our products. 
 We believe that global cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing revolving credit facility and our ability to access bank debt, private debt and the capital markets for additional funds, will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In addition, we expect that foreign cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter.

 39,286 (65,012) 
 Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers and lower cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by higher payments for cash expenses. 
 Our primary uses of cash from operating activities a re for the payment of cash compensation expenses, income taxes, interest expenses, technology costs, professional fees, market data costs and office rent. Historically, the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year. 
 Cash Flows From Investing Activities 
 The year-over-year change was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Fabric and Foxberry and higher capitalized software development costs. 
 Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
 The year-over-year change was primarily driven by the repayment of outstanding balances under our Revolving Credit Facility and higher dividend payments. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk. Exchange rate movements can impact the U.S. dollar-reported value of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded. 
 We generally invoice our clients in U.S. dollars; however, we invoice a portion of our clients in Euros, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and a limited number of other non-U.S. dollar currencies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 16.6 and 17.0 , respectively, of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily included clients billed in foreign currency as well as U.S. dollar exposures on non-U.S. dollar foreign operating entities. Of the 16.6 of non-U.S. dollar exposure for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 42.2 was in Euros, 32.9 was in British pounds sterling and 17.7 was in Japanese yen. Of the 17.0 of non-U.S. dollar exposure for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 41.7 was in Euros, 32.5 was in British pounds sterling and 17.6 was in Japanese yen. 
 Revenues from asset-based fees represented 22.8 and 22.4 of operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. While a substantial portion of our asset-based fees are invoiced in U.S. dollars, the fees are based on the assets in investment products, of which approximately three-fifths are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, declines in such other currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses. In addition, declines in such currencies against the U.S. dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows, which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses. 
 We are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs. Approximately 41.8 and 43.4 of our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were denominated in foreign currencies, the significant majority of which were denominated in British pounds sterling, Indian rupees, Euros, Hungarian forints, Mexican pesos and Swiss francs.

 We have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts, and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency, either a gain or a loss results from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies. We manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, in part, through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies. We recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 5.0 million and 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report, and have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time specified in the SEC s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Various lawsuits, arbitrations, claims, government inquiries, requests for information, regulatory investigations, examinations, inspections, other proceedings and subpoenas have been or may be instituted or asserted against the Company in the ordinary course of business. While the potential losses could be substantial, due to uncertainties surrounding the potential outcomes, management cannot currently reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Consequently, it is possible that MSCI s business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these matters. However, based on facts currently available, we believe that the disposition of matters that are currently pending or asserted will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on MSCI s business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 For a discussion of the risk factors affecting the Company, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors and uncertainties known to the Company and disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that, if they were to materialize or occur, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on MSCI s business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.

Exhibit 10.1 
 MSCI INC. 
 Executive Committee Stock Ownership Guidelines 
 The Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee (the Committee of the Board of Directors of MSCI Inc. (the Company has adopted these Executive Committee Stock Ownership Guidelines (the Ownership Guidelines ), effective January 1, 2019 (the Effective Date ), to further align the interests of the Company s Executive Committee members with those of the Company s stockholders and further promote sound corporate governance. Capitalized terms used but not defined in the Ownership Guidelines will have the meanings set forth in the MSCI Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (together with any successor plan, the Plan ). 
 1. Minimum Ownership Requirements . Each Executive Committee member (each, an Executive is required, within five years following the date of such Executive s appointment to the Executive Committee (or, if later, five years following the Effective Date), to own a target number of Eligible Shares (as defined below), having an aggregate value equal to the multiple of his or her annual base salary indicated in the table below, based upon his or her position. 
 
 Position Multiple of Base Salary Chief Executive Officer 12X President 12X Other Management Committee Members 8X All Other Executive Committee Members 4X 
 An Executive who holds more than one title indicated above will be expected to satisfy the highest applicable ownership requirement. 
 
 Each Executive shall be subject to these Ownership Guidelines for as long as he or she continues to serve on the Executive Committee. If an Executive is or becomes in compliance with the Ownership Guidelines on the Effective Date or any time thereafter, he or she may not take any action that would result in noncompliance with the Ownership Guidelines. 
 
 If an Executive becomes subject to an increased ownership requirement due to a promotion, the Executive will be expected to meet the higher ownership amount within five years from the effective date of the promotion (the Transition Period ). For the avoidance of doubt, the Executive will remain subject to the original minimum ownership requirement during any such Transition Period. 
 
 Page 1 

If an Executive becomes subject to an increased minimum ownership requirement due to an increase in his or her base salary, the Executive will still be expected to meet the increased minimum ownership requirement within five years of the Effective Date or five years following his or her first appointment to the Executive Committee, whichever is later (i.e., there is no Transition Period). 
 
 2. Retention Requirements . 
 
 Until the Executive ceases to serve on the Executive Committee, such Executive shall be required to retain a number of Shares equivalent to, in the aggregate 25 of the Net Shares resulting from the vesting, settlement or exercise, as applicable, of all stock options, restricted stock units RSUs ), performance stock units PSUs and other equity Awards granted to such Executive under the Plan after the later of (i) the date such Executive becomes a member of the Executive Committee and (ii) January 1, 2022 (the Covered Award Share Retention Requirement ). 
 
 In addition to the Covered Award Share Retention Requirement, until the Executive has satisfied the applicable minimum ownership requirement, such Executive is required to retain at least 50 of the Net Shares resulting from the vesting, settlement or exercise, as applicable, of all stock options, RSUs, PSUs or other equity Awards granted to such Executive under the Plan. 
 
 For these purposes, Net Shares means the number of Shares that would remain if the Shares underlying the equity awards are sold or withheld by the Company to (i) pay the exercise price of a stock option, (ii) satisfy any tax withholding obligations upon the vesting, settlement or exercise, as applicable, of the equity awards (assuming a tax rate of 50 or (iii) satisfy any other applicable transaction costs. 
 
 Shares (and the Executive s rights with respect to Shares) subject to the retention requirements of the Ownership Guidelines (including the Covered Award Share Retention Requirement) shall not, directly or indirectly, be sold, transferred, encumbered, alienated, exchanged, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, hedged, made subject to execution, attachment or similar process, or in any manner be subject to puts or calls or otherwise disposed of, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and whether by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the prior approval of the Committee in its discretion, Shares subject to the retention requirements of the Ownership Guidelines may be transferred by the Executive for estate planning purposes to any trust or other estate planning vehicle established and controlled by such Executive, provided that such trust or other estate planning vehicle shall remain subject to the retention requirements of the Ownership Guidelines. 
 
 3. Shares Included in Ownership Calculation . Shares eligible to be counted towards the satisfaction of the minimum ownership requirements under these Ownership Guidelines consist of the following (collectively, the Eligible Shares 
 
 Page 2 

A. Shares beneficially owned individually, either directly or indirectly (including Shares held through a broker in individual brokerage accounts and Shares owned indirectly through a trust) 
 B. Shares beneficially owned jointly with, or separately by, immediate family members residing in the same household, either directly or indirectly and C. Shares underlying unvested RSUs. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, unexercised stock options and unvested performance Awards will not be counted as Eligible Shares for purposes of the minimum ownership requirements under these Ownership Guidelines. 
 
 4. Valuation . Compliance with the Ownership Guidelines will be measured for each Executive on an annual basis on a date to be determined by the Committee. Compliance with the minimum ownership requirements under these Ownership Guidelines will be calculated using the closing price of a Share as reported on the principal stock market or exchange on which the Shares are quoted or traded on the last trading day of the first fiscal quarter of the calendar year immediately preceding the applicable compliance measurement date. The Committee may take into consideration decreases in stock prices in determining whether an Executive is in compliance with these Ownership Guidelines 
 
 5. Compliance and Exceptions . 
 The Committee shall evaluate whether any exceptions should be made for any Executive who, due to unique financial circumstances, would incur a hardship by complying with these Ownership Guidelines. The Committee may, in its discretion, modify or waive for a reasonable time these Ownership Guidelines, or develop an alternative stock ownership plan, in each case, taking into account individual, Company and market circumstances, as appropriate. 
 The Committee may consider, in its discretion, whether any actions should be taken in the event of an Executive s failure to meet, or in unique circumstances, to show sustained progress towards meeting, these Ownership Guidelines (including, without limitation, actions with respect to the specific terms and value of future equity incentive awards granted to the Executive and or appropriate levels of the Executive s compensation). 
 
 6. Additional Requirements . 
 
 In accordance with procedures adopted by the Company from time to time, prior to entering into any transaction to dispose of Shares, each Executive shall certify in writing to the Head of Global Compensation and Benefits that he or she is in compliance with these Ownership Guidelines. 
 
 From time to time, the Committee may impose other stock ownership or retention requirements on Executives pursuant to the terms of an Award. For instance, the Company has included additional retention requirements with respect to certain PSUs. Executives should carefully 
 Page 3 

review the terms of individual Awards for any applicable stock ownership or retention requirements. 
 
 7. Trading Prohibition . 
 
 Executives are subject to applicable federal and state laws and Company policy restricting trading on material non-public or inside information. These laws and rules may also limit the ability of an Executive to buy or sell Shares from time to time. Affiliates of the Company may also be subject to reporting obligations and potential short-swing profit liability under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Any resales of Shares by an affiliate must typically be made in accordance with the volume, manner of sale, notice and other requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 
 Compliance with these Ownership Guidelines is in addition to, not in lieu of, compliance with any other applicable laws or Company policies. 
 
 8. Administration, Modification and Interpretation . 
 
 The Committee shall be responsible for monitoring the application of these Ownership Guidelines. The Committee may delegate ministerial administrative duties to one or more officers or employees of the Company, as determined in its sole discretion. 
 
 At least annually, management shall provide the Committee with a report on the status of each Executive s compliance with the Ownership Guidelines. 
 
 The Committee reserves the right to interpret, change, amend, modify or terminate these Ownership Guidelines at any time and from time to time, as determined in its sole discretion. 
 Adopted by the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee on December 10, 2018, as amended on April 30, 2019, January 25, 2022, and October 30, 2024 (effective January 1, 2025).
