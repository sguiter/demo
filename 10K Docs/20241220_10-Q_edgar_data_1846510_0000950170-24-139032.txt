Soho House Co Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 

million and a consolidated net loss of million, respectively. During the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, the Company had net cash provided by operations of million. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit balance of million, cash and cash equivalents of million, and a restricted cash balance of million. In assessing the going concern basis of preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, we have taken into consideration detailed cash flow forecasts for the Company, the Company s forecast compliance with bank covenants, and the timing of debt commitments within 12 months of the approval of these financial statements, and the continued availability of committed and accessible working capital to the Company. We have considered current global economic and political uncertainties, specifically including inflationary pressures on consumables purchased and wages, and the Company has factored these in when it undertook an assessment of the cash flow forecasts covering a period of at least months from the date these financial statements are issued. Cash flow forecasts have been prepared based on a range of scenarios including, but not limited to, no further debt or equity funding, repayment of existing short-term debt, macro-economic dynamics, cost reductions, both limited and extensive, and a combination of these different scenarios. Based on the above, the consolidated financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, we continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 .

 million of impairment losses on long-lived assets (comprised of million in respect of Operating lease assets and million of Property and equipment, net) during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 . impairment losses were recorded for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended October 1, 2023. In the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024 , the Company identified a triggering impairment event due to the continued challenges in the cost of real estate and the decreased performance of various Soho Works locations in the USA. The Company performed an impairment analysis on four Soho Work sites in the United States. As a result of the third quarter of 2024 analysis, a million non-cash impairment charge was recorded for these Soho Works sites. The high property costs associated with these locations being the primary factor of the asset impairment. The Company also identified a triggering impairment event in one of their UK restaurant sites. The non-cash impairment charge for the UK restaurant site was less than million. The non-cash impairment charge is included in impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of operations for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024. The primary assumptions, which requires significant level of judgement, that affects the undiscounted cash flows determination is management's estimate of future revenues, operating margins, economic conditions and changes in the operating environment. The forecasts used in the impairment assessments was developed by management based on projected revenues derived largely from forecasted member attendance. Management also makes estimates on the expected costs and the expected operating lease costs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the recoverability of the assets and may result in additional impairment charges. Changes in the membership, operating margins and economic growth and the contracted operating rental costs beyond what has already been assumed in the assessments could cause management to revise the forecast and assumptions. Unfavorable revisions to these assumptions or estimates could possibly result in further impairment of some or all of the assets .

Share Repurchases On March 18, 2022, the Company s board and a relevant sub-committee thereof authorized and approved a stock repurchase program for up to million of the then outstanding shares of the Company s Class A common stock. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company was authorized to repurchase from time-to-time shares of its outstanding Class A common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in the United States. The timing and amount of stock repurchases depended on a variety of factors, including market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. The stock repurchase program could have been suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, in accordance with relevant and applicable regulatory requirements, and the Company has had no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the program. The Company intended to make all repurchases in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as amended. Under the program, the repurchased shares were returned to the status of authorized, but unissued shares of common stock held in treasury at average cost. The repurchase plan upper limit of million was met in December 2022 and as such there were no further stock repurchases under the above plan subsequent to December 2022. On September 20, 2023, the Company repurchased million shares of its Class A common stock from its Founder and director Nick Jones for million. The privately negotiated transaction was approved by the board of directors. The shares are now held as treasury shares by the Company. On February 9, 2024, the Company s board and a relevant sub-committee authorized and approved a new stock repurchase program for up to million of the currently outstanding shares of the Company s Class A common stock. D uring the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 , the Company repurchased a total of shares and shares of Class A common stock for million and million, respectively, including commissions, under the new program . The repurchased shares are held as treasury shares by the Company. Loss Per Share The Company computes loss per share using the two-class method. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings or losses are allocated on a proportionate basis to each class of common stock, and the resulting basic and diluted loss per share attributable to common stockholders are therefore the same for Class A and Class B common stock.

The effective tax rate for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024 was , compared to for the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023, as revised. The effective tax rate for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 was compared to for the 39 weeks ended October 1, 2023, as revised. The effective tax rates for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 differ from the US statutory rate of primarily due to the mix of positive and negative earnings in the various jurisdictions the Company operates in and valuation allowances which reduce the amount of tax benefit recognized on the pretax book loss. Additionally, the Company is calculating current tax charges in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions related to uncertain tax positions over a pretax book loss for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 which is the primary difference as compared to the prior year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) global tax reform initiative introduces a global minimum tax of on country-by-country profits applicable to large multinational corporations. As part of this international initiative, the UK enacted its BEPS Pillar Two Minimum Tax legislation in July 2023 with effect for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. The Company has carried out an assessment of the impact of this legislation for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 and has concluded that these new rules are not likely to have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate or tax payments for this period. The Company will undertake this assessment for subsequent reporting periods to monitor its compliance with the GloBE rules for fiscal 2024.

 shares of Class A common stock as a result of SARs being exercised. Lease contracts with related parties On October 21, 2024, the Le Vallauris restaurant California (US), and the Willows Historic Palm Springs Inn (California, US) lease contracts were modified to defer the rent until Palm Springs Soho House opening date. This modification was a result of rent negotiation efforts between two parties to reflect the commercial relationship between the restaurant, inn and House locations. As disclosed in Note 16 Related Party Transactions, the Company leases these properties from GHPSI, LLC, an affiliate of Yucaipa.

 Overview 
 SHCO is a global membership platform that connects a vibrant, diverse group of members from across the world. These members use the platform to both work and socialize, to connect, create, have fun and drive a positive change. The central pillar of SHCO is Soho House, which drives the majority of our membership and revenue today. A Soho House membership offers access to a network of distinctive and carefully curated Houses, across the Americas, the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia, which serve as the cornerstone of our member experience. We enhance our member experience through our digital channels, including the Soho House App and our website. 
 Over the last 29 years, we have expanded our membership expertise and diversified our offerings both physically and digitally. As of September 29, 2024, we had approximately 267,500 members (including approximately 208,100 Soho House Members) who engage with SHCO through our global portfolio of 45 Soho Houses, 8 Soho Works, Scorpios Beach Clubs in Mykonos and Bodrum, Soho Home, our interiors and lifestyle retail brand, and our digital channels. The Ned hotels in London, New York and Doha and The LINE and Saguaro hotels in The Americas also form part of SHCO s wider portfolio via management agreements to operate the properties. 
 Our membership expertise, honed through the growth of Soho House, has led to our evolution into Soho House Co, a home to numerous memberships including Cities Without Houses, Soho Works, Soho Friends, and Ned s Club. By designing, curating and growing our membership offering, our membership platform can quickly and easily respond to shifting lifestyle trends and the evolution of our members needs. Our memberships work together, allowing us to reach new audiences with a set of interconnected offerings. 
 Our membership has remained resilient through multiple economic cycles and other macroeconomic dislocations, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The power of our model is driven by the important role we believe that we play in our members lives and the value we consistently provide them for their membership fees. We believe our retention compares favorably to leading consumer subscriptions or memberships across music, media, fitness, entertainment and commerce despite, in many cases, their significantly lower price points. 
 The demand for our membership is also demonstrated by our large and growing SHCO global waitlist, which as of September 29, 2024 stands at approximately 111,000 applicants. Awareness of our distinct membership offerings and their scarcity is spread by our members organically through word of mouth, social media and press coverage. 
 Further, we have observed a secular shift in the ways that people live and work with less time spent in traditional corporate offices and more time in social spaces that encourage creativity and mutual engagement. We believe that these trends will only accelerate, and that the freedom to be able to choose where to live and work will likely have a significant impact on our target market. We believe this will create an even greater demand for curated communities that can grow and thrive in a more deliberate environment. 
 Membership Revenues are comprised of annual membership fees and one-time initial registration fees paid by members. In-House Revenues include all revenues realized within our Houses, including food and beverage, accommodation, and spa products and treatments. We view Membership Revenues and In-House revenues as interrelated, although there is no minimum spend for any member on our In-House offerings that generate In-House Revenues. In practice the significant majority of In-House Revenues are generated by our members, and the pricing of our In-House offerings reflects that accordingly, with pricing of such In-House offerings being identical for both members and non-members. 
 Other revenues include all revenues not realized within our Houses, including Scorpios, Soho Works and stand-alone restaurants, design and procurement fees from Soho House Design, Soho Home and Cowshed retail products and other revenues from products and services that we provide outside of our Houses, as well as management fees from hotel management contracts for The Ned Sites and The LINE and Saguaro hotels. 
 Our Membership Platform 
 All of our memberships have been built to enrich the lives of their members, as well as expand our membership offering to a broader audience. 
 45 

Soho House 
 Soho House remains at the core of our membership platform by creating a foundation upon which additional membership businesses can be built and scaled. 
 Every House annual membership fee is approximately 4,800, excluding local sales taxes, which provides access to all of our Houses globally. Our Houses attract members from every demographic, with members from Generation Z (27 years old and younger) and Millennials (28 to 43 year-olds) constituting the fastest-growing cohorts. We believe the pricing of our In-House offerings represents great value to our members because of the level of quality provided, reinforcing the overall membership experience, rewarding their brand loyalty and creating opportunities for future and recurring revenues. 
 We created the following types of membership under Soho House to reach a broader audience and enhance the experience of our existing members: 
 Cities Without Houses 

This membership allows us to welcome members to our global community in new geographies where we do not have a physical House. Through this membership we are able to generate additional revenues on our existing base of Houses and gather intelligence for future growth, which we have leveraged to open new Houses in certain locations, including Bangkok, Thailand (February 2023), Mexico City, Mexico (September 2023), Portland, USA (March 2024), Sao Paulo, Brazil (June 2024) and planned future openings in places such as Manchester, United Kingdom and Milan, Italy. As of September 29, 2024, we had 11,879 CWH members across 83 cities. 
 Soho Friends 

Through this membership we offer access to some physical House spaces, including Soho House bedrooms, and screenings, with additional benefits from our restaurants, spas and online retail brands to an audience who enjoy the Soho House offerings but do not have a Soho House Membership. Soho Friends annual membership is approximately 130 and does not provide full access to our Houses. As of September 29, 2024, we had 53,235 Soho Friends members. We intend to grow this membership brand in a measured way so that our Soho House Members continue to account for the majority of visitors to our Houses and restaurants. 
 Soho Works 

Soho Works provides its members with the space and resources to work alongside other like-minded individuals and businesses facilitating connections and providing the tools to flourish. Aimed primarily at existing Soho House and Soho Friends members, with locations in LA, New York and London. Soho Works draws on the same design principles and membership ethos as Soho House, but is a space purposed entirely for work and creative collaboration. As of September 29, 2024, we had 6,181 Soho Works members. Soho Works membership rates vary by location and Soho House membership status. For Adult Paying Members, a US Soho Works membership ranges from 200 to 750 per month, depending on membership type. 
 Scorpios Beach Club 
 Scorpios is a well-established globally recognized brand, focused on enriching the lives of its guests who are looking to escape from their daily lives, with two locations currently open. The original Scorpios, set in a cove on the southern tip of Mykonos, offers a one of a kind beach experience with a restaurant, terraces and daybeds, and a distinctive wellness offering. The second location, which opened in Bodrum, Turkey, in June 2024, offers similar seaside restaurant and terrace experiences, and also includes 12 bungalows equipped with private pools. We believe the Scorpios concept has significant potential to expand further, with the expectation to open a third site in Tulum, Mexico. 
 The Ned 
 The Ned brand seeks to embody a city within a city full-service destination, by playing host to multiple restaurants, bedrooms, a range of grooming services, spa, gym and a full-service members club. The membership offered by The Ned Ned s Club including Ned s Friends is aimed at a broader group of professional people. As of September 29, 2024, Ned s Club London, New York and Doha had approximately 4,600 members, and expect to open a fourth site in Washington, D.C. in early 2025. The Ned offers its members The Ned s Club app, which allows members to make bookings, publish benefits, events and club related information. We receive management fees under hotel management contracts for each of the existing operations of The Ned sites. 
 The LINE 
 On June 22, 2021, we acquired the operating agreements relating to the The LINE and Saguaro hotels. The hotels that are currently operational are located in Los Angeles, Washington, Austin, Palm Springs, and San Francisco, and among them offer a variety of food and beverage offerings together with approximately 1,500 hotel rooms. We receive management fees under hotel management contracts for the operation of these hotels. The transaction has broadened our geographic reach in The Americas. 
 Factors Affecting Our Business 
 We believe the coveted lifestyle brand we have created has significant and proven growth potential. This potential, combined with the stability of our membership base, we believe will enable us to maintain our position as an industry leader in the future. We expect to grow our member base by growing the number of Soho Houses, continuing to scale our existing membership brands and launching and growing new membership brands. We believe our track record in expanding and growing our platform will position us to achieve significant and sustained growth. 
 A significant portion of our revenues is derived from House Revenues which consist of Membership Revenues and In-House Revenues. Our Membership Revenues, which are reflective of our steady and growing global brand, help to provide us with a recurring revenue base that limits the impact of fluctuations in regional economic conditions. 
 46 

Our business and future performance is also affected by a variety of factors, including: 
 The ability to grow our member base. Long-term member growth is a direct driver of Membership Revenue growth and an important factor in driving In-House Revenue growth. The impact of long-term member growth on Membership Revenues can be particularly impactful to our earnings given the lower direct expenses associated with incremental Membership Revenues relative to our other revenue streams. 

Our ability to grow In-House Revenues . In addition to their annual membership fee, our members pay for goods and services that they consume, which we refer to as In-House Revenues. We continue to actively develop the offerings in our Soho Houses and our other membership brands to improve overall experience and capture greater spend on food and beverage, accommodation, spa services, private events and our other goods and services. We believe that the pricing of our In-House offerings, which is reflective of the membership fees we receive from members who consume most of our In-House offerings, represents great value to our members for the level of quality provided, reinforcing the overall membership experience, rewarding brand loyalty and creating the opportunity for future revenue enhancement. Our proven ability to drive long-term member growth at existing Houses is also an important contributing factor in sustaining In-House Revenue growth. 

Our ability to adjust membership pricing . As we expand our number of Soho Houses globally and continue to invest in maintaining the quality of our existing Soho Houses, we are able to grow Membership Revenues by periodically reviewing our membership fee rates, as well as migrating members from Local House to Every House membership, which also has the effect of increasing Membership Revenues. Contrary to traditional hospitality companies which may experience brand dilution as they expand, the value of our membership and brand strengthens as we expand into new cities and properties. As we expand globally, the value of an Every House membership becomes more compelling to both new and existing members, enhancing our revenue potential. Historically, our membership price increases have not had a material impact on our retention rates and we believe this provides a strong indication of demand and price inelasticity for our memberships. 

Our ability to grow our membership brands and products . We believe the strength of our brand and our culture of creativity and innovation will allow us to continue to capitalize on opportunities in complementary concepts and product lines and that our adjacent lines of business can achieve substantial stand-alone scale. Our expansion into new products and businesses can contribute meaningfully to our revenue in the future as we tap into our existing and growing membership base. 

Reportable Segments 
 Our operations consist of three reportable segments (United Kingdom, The Americas, Europe and Rest of the World RoW )) and one non-reportable segment that we present as All Other . Each of our segments includes all operations in that region including our Houses and all associated facilities, spas and stand-alone restaurants. The historical North America reportable segment has been renamed to The Americas; however, there is no change to the manner in which the segment was previously presented. Refer to Note 15, Segments in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on reportable segments. 
 Key Performance, Operating Metrics and Additional Financial Measures and Other Data Evaluated by Management 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of operating and financial measures and metrics. These measures and metrics include: 
 NUMBER OF SOHO HOUSES . The number of Soho Houses reflects the total number of Soho Houses in operation in any period, irrespective of whether each House is (i) controlled by us, (ii) operated through a non-controlling interest in a joint venture or (iii) operated under a management contract. 
 We review the number of members from all Houses to assess new member growth, total House Revenues, and House-Level Contribution. 
 NUMBER OF SOHO HOUSE MEMBERS . Our Soho House membership model is an integral part of our business and has a significant impact on our profitability and financial performance. Typically, members hold an Every House membership or a Local House membership. Member count is the primary driver of Membership Revenues and is also a critical factor in driving In-House Revenues as members utilize the offerings that are provided within the Houses. Soho House members include all active, frozen and non-paying members. 
 The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, retain existing members and periodically increase our membership fee rates will impact our profitability. We have historically enjoyed strong member loyalty, reflected by very high retention rates. Robust demand for our memberships is also evidenced by considerable wait lists for our Houses. 
 The year-over-year increase in our total number of Soho House Members is driven by a combination of increases in membership at existing Houses and members from new Houses. 
 SOHO HOUSE MEMBER RETENTION. Soho House Member Retention is defined as the number of Adult Paying Members (being all Soho House members excluding child members and complimentary members) at the beginning of a period less the number of Adult Paying Members who canceled their membership during that same period (without giving any effect to Adult Paying Members who froze their memberships during such period), as a proportion of total Adult Paying Members at the beginning of such period. 
 NUMBER OF OTHER MEMBERS . Other members include members of Soho Works and Soho Friends are key to our growth strategy and enhancing our Soho House member experience. Like Adult Paying members, other memberships are an integral part of our business and we believe will have a significant impact on our profitability and financial performance in the future. 
 FROZEN MEMBERS . Frozen Members refers to Adult Paying Members who have elected to suspend their membership payments on a six, nine- or twelve-month basis during which period the member is not able to gain access to a Soho House site as a member, access our membership Apps, or book bedrooms or 
 47 

Cowshed treatments or products on discounted member rates. Frozen Members are not included in Adult Paying Members, but are included in the total number of Soho House members. 
 MEMBERSHIP REVENUES . Membership Revenues are comprised of House Membership Revenues (as defined below) and Non-House Membership Revenues (as defined below). House Membership Revenues and Non-House Membership Revenues are each comprised primarily of annual membership fees and one-time registration fees which are amortized over 20 years. The one-time registration fee is no longer applicable to new members admitted from April 4, 2022; see "House Introduction Credits" below. Membership Revenues are a function of the number of members, membership mix, and membership pricing. For GAAP, we report Membership Revenues only from Houses and sites in which we own a controlling interest. Our membership pricing varies by geographic segment and membership offering and, as such, our mix of House and Soho Works club openings can affect our revenue growth and profitability over time. Prices are generally higher in The Americas and the RoW compared with the UK and Europe. Membership Revenues provide a stable and recurring source of revenues which have few direct costs and, as such, is a reliable and predictable source of cash flow. 
 HOUSE INTRODUCTION CREDITS. New members admitted from April 4, 2022 have been required to purchase House Introduction Credits as part of their membership, per the House rules. House Introduction Credits are credits of an equivalent value to cash within Houses and are redeemable to purchase food and beverage items, and bedroom stays, at the Houses. House Introduction Credits expire after the first three months from the date of issuance, where legally permitted in the regions we operate, if not utilized or if the Company terminates a member s House membership. House Introduction Credits are recognized upon issuance as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Revenue from House Introduction Credits are recognized as In-House revenues when redeemed by members, and as breakage revenue within Membership revenues upon expiration or in the period that we are able to reliably estimate expected breakage to the extent that they are unredeemed, are recognized. 
 HOUSE MEMBERSHIP REVENUES . House Membership Revenues are comprised primarily of annual membership fees and one-time legacy registration fees from Adult Paying Members which are amortized over 20 years. The one-time registration fee is no longer applicable to new members admitted from April 4, 2022; see "House Introduction Credits" above. 
 IN-HOUSE REVENUES . In-House Revenues refer to all revenues realized within our Houses, and primarily includes revenues from food and beverage, accommodation, and spa products and treatments. 
 HOUSE REVENUES . House Revenues is defined as Membership revenues plus In-House revenues, less Non-House Membership Revenues. Our management views House Membership Revenues and In-House Revenues as interrelated and their aggregation as important in tracking House performance. Although there is no minimum spend for any member on In-House offerings, in practice most members consume food and beverage, accommodations and other offerings at our Houses. The pricing of our In-House offerings is reflective of the fact that the significant majority of In-House offerings that generate In-House revenues are consumed by members who also pay a membership fee in relation to that House, with pricing of such In-House offerings being identical for both members and non-members. 
 OTHER REVENUES . Other revenues are defined as total revenues that are not realized within our Houses, including revenues from Scorpios, Soho Works and our stand-alone restaurants, procurement fees from SHD, Soho Home retail products and Cowshed services and brand license fees and other revenues from products and services that we provide outside of our Houses. Additionally, this category also includes management fees from hotel management contracts for The Ned Sites and the LINE and Saguaro hotels. 
 NON-HOUSE MEMBERSHIP REVENUES . Non-House Membership Revenues are comprised of Soho Works membership revenues and Soho Friends membership revenue. 
 ACTIVE APP USERS . Active App Users is defined as unique users who have logged into any of our membership Apps within the previous three months. 
 AVERAGE DAILY RATE ("ADR"). Average Daily Rate represents the average rental income per paid occupied room. We believe this is a meaningful indicator of our performance. 
 REVENUE PER AVAILABLE ROOM ("RevPAR"). The key industry standard for measuring hotel-operating performance is RevPAR, which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms to available rooms by the ADR realized. We believe RevPAR is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues, and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our revenue. We also believe occupancy and ADR, which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Where this is presented on a like-for like basis, RevPAR is adjusted for new or divested sites, for example Houses that were not open in the comparison period. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We refer to Adjusted EBITDA, House-Level Contribution, House-Level Contribution Margin, Other Contribution and Other Contribution Margin throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as we use these measures to evaluate our operating performance and each of these measures is defined in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. We believe these measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, House-Level Contribution, House-Level Contribution Margin, Other Contribution and Other Contribution Margin are all supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, House-Level Contribution, House-Level Contribution Margin, Other Contribution and Other Contribution Margin should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP metrics such as Operating Income (Loss) and Net Loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Some of our financial and operational data that we disclose in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are presented on a constant currency basis to isolate the effect of currency changes during the period. Where we refer to a measure being calculated in constant currency , we are calculating the USD change and the percent change as if the exchange rate that is being used in the current period was in effect for 
 48 

the prior period presented. We believe that this calculation provides a more meaningful indication of actual year-over-year performance and eliminates the fluctuations from currency exchange rates.

Membership revenues increased by 17 to 107,394 for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024 predominantly driven by an increase in Adult Paying Members of 11 , or 16,500, who joined after the end of the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023. Additionally, all Soho House Adult paying fees were increased at the start of fiscal 2023, impacting members on their renewal date throughout fiscal 2023. 
 
 All Soho House Adult paying fees increased in January 2024, with in general a low single-digit price rise for existing members and a mid single-digit increase 
 in price for new members. This increase will impact new members on the date they join and existing members on their renewal date. 
 
 There was also an increase in Non-House Membership revenues of 343. This was driven by Soho Works as a result of increased membership fees in fiscal 2024, partially offset by a reduction in the number of Soho Friends members in comparison to the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023. 
 
 The Americas segment saw an increase in membership revenues of 7,515, or 17 , due to approximately 8,800, or 15 increase in Adult Paying Soho House members year-on-year, with the opening of Soho House Sao Paulo (June, 2024), Soho House Portland (March, 2024) and Soho House Mexico City (September 2023), as well as growth across existing Houses. The impact of the membership fee increases noted also contributed to the increase in Membership revenues. 
 
 Our United Kingdom segment saw an increase in Membership revenues of 4,707, or 17 , due to approximately 2,900, or 5 increase in Adult Paying Soho House members, driven by growth in existing Houses, coupled with the impact of the House membership fee increases as noted above. Although Soho Mews House opened in London in late September 2024, no paying members were active as of September 29, 2024. In constant currency, Membership revenues in the United Kingdom segment increased by 3,386, or 12 . 
 
 The Europe/RoW segment saw an increase in Membership revenues of 1,372, or 13 , due to approximately 2,500, or 10 increase in Adult paying members, driven by growth in existing Houses, alongside revenue impact of the House membership fee increases as noted above. In constant currency, Membership revenues in the Europe/RoW segment increased by 866, or 8 . 
 
 All Other saw an increase in Membership revenues of 1,751, or 16 , predominantly driven by approximately 2,300, or 28 more CWH Adult Paying Members, with the growth rate offset by a decline of approximately 11,300 Non-House members in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In constant currency, All Other Membership revenues increased by 1,216, or 11 . 
 In constant currency, Membership revenues increased by 12,983, or 14 .

In-House revenues were 120,658 for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 5,435 versus the comparative period in 2023. Revenues were supported by four new Houses that opened since the beginning of the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023, including Soho Mews House which opened in London in late September 2024, but did not meaningfully contribute to In-House revenues in the quarter. 
 The Americas In-House revenues were 46,646 for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 2,804 versus the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023. The region benefited from the opening of Soho House Mexico City (September 2023), Soho House Portland (March 2024) and Soho House Sao Paulo (June 2024). 
 In-House revenues in our United Kingdom segment saw an increase of 2,748 versus the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023, with notably strong year-over-year performance at our countryside sites. In constant currency, In-House Revenues in the United Kingdom segment saw an increase of 530, or 1 . 
 The Europe/RoW segment decreased in-House revenues by 117 year-on-year. The majority of Houses saw growth year-over-year, however this was offset by weaker performance in our Tel Aviv House versus comparative period driven by external factors. In constant currency, In-House Revenues in the Europe/RoW segment a decrease by 1,376 or 5 . 
 In constant currency, In-House Revenues increased by 1,958, or 2 .

 Other revenues in The Americas segment increased 686, or 4 versus the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023 supported by a termination fee related to one of our LINE hotel management contracts, offset by a slight decline in sales in some of the stand-alone restaurants period-on-period. 
 The United Kingdom segment saw an increase in Other revenues of 1,492, or 8 versus third quarter fiscal 2023 driven by higher design fees offsetting slightly softer sales year-over-year in our stand alone restaurants.

 Other revenues in the Europe/RoW segment have increased 14,225 or 48 compared to the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023 predominantly driven by the opening of Scorpios Bodrum (June, 2024). In constant currency, Other Revenues in the Europe/RoW segment increased by 12,790, or 41 . 
 Other revenues in All Other have increased 2,798 or 12 period-on-period driven by growth in Soho Home, offset by Cowshed operating under brand license (since January 1, 2024), which results in recognition of royalty income in 2024 versus revenue in fiscal 2023. In constant currency, Other Revenues in All Other increased by 1,690, or 7 .

In-House Operating Expenses were 158,790 for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 11,559. The increase is a result of the four new Houses opened since the beginning of the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023, alongside period-on-period wage increases. In constant currency, In-House Operating Expenses increased by 4,387. 
 House-Level Contribution, which is defined as House Revenues less In-House Operating Expenses, was 60,835 for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to 51,957 for the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023, an increase of 8,878. The increase in House-Level Contribution predominantly relates to increased Soho House membership and In-House revenues period-on-period, offset by higher In-House operating expenses. 
 House-Level Contribution Margin was 28 for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 2 from the prior period due to increased revenues, especially membership. All regions increased House-Level margins period-on-period benefitting from higher membership revenue, with the exception of the United Kingdom segment which remained flat partially driven by the impact of higher inflation in In-House Operating expenses.

This increased spend is predominantly driven by the opening of the new Scorpios site in Bodrum, higher costs in relation to revenue growth at Soho Home, and write-off of design costs for Houses no longer going ahead. This increase was offset by the permanent closure of our operations at The Hoxton (July 2023) and the removal of expenses relating to Cowshed operations following the move to a brand license deal effective January 1, 2024 . In constant currency, Other Operating Expenses increased by 10,770, or 14 . 
 Other Contribution, which we define as Other Revenues plus Non-House Membership Revenues less Other Operating Expenses, was 27,064 for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to 21,816 for the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023, an increase of 5,248 predominantly driven by Scorpios.

Pre-opening expenses were 2,561 for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024 compared to 5,094 in the 13 weeks ended October 1, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by the size and location of House openings. The House opening in the period was a small House in an established market (London) so for example travel costs are lower, in comparison to the opening of a large House in a new market, Mexico City. In constant currency pre-opening expenses reduced by 52 .

Membership revenues increased by 18 (16 constant currency) to 308,690 for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, predominantly driven by an increase in Adult Paying Members of 11 , or 16,500, who joined after the end of the 39 weeks ended October 1, 2023 
 
 All Soho House Adult paying fees increased in January 2024, with in general a low single-digit price rise for existing members and a mid single-digit increase 
 in price for new members. This increase will impact new members on the date they join and existing members on their renewal date. 
 
 There was also an increase in Non-House Membership revenues of 1,575, this was driven by Soho Works as a result of increased membership fees in fiscal 
 2024. This was offset slightly by a reduction in the number of Soho Friends members in comparison to the end of the 39 weeks ended October 1, 2023. 
 
 The Americas segment saw an increase in revenues of 20,804, or 17 , due to approximately 8,800, or 15 increase in Adult Paying Soho House members year-on-year, with the opening of Soho House Sao Paulo (June 2024), Soho House Portland (March 2024) and Soho House Mexico City (September 2023), as well as growth across existing Houses. The impact of the membership fee increases noted also contributed to the increase in Membership revenues. 
 
 Our United Kingdom segment saw an increase in Membership revenues of 14,545, or 19 (16 constant currency), due to approximately 2,900, or 5 increase in Adult Paying Soho House members, driven by growth in existing Houses, coupled with the impact of the House membership fee increases as noted above. Although Soho Mews House opened in London in late September 2024, no paying members we active as of September 29, 2024. 
 
 The Europe/RoW segment saw an increase in Membership revenues of 5,270, or 18 (15 constant currency), due to approximately 2,500, or 10 increase in Adult paying members, as well as the revenue impact of the House membership fee increases as noted above. 
 
 Membership revenue reported under All Other above saw an increase predominantly driven by over 2,200, or 28 more CWH Adult Paying Members, offset by a decline of approximately 11,300 Non-House members in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 In constant currency, Membership revenues increased by 42,459, or 16 .

In-House revenues were 358,213 for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 1,351 versus the 39 weeks ended October 1, 2023. Revenues were supported by five new Houses that opened since the beginning of fiscal 2023, offset by underlying macroeconomic trends have adversely impacted regions throughout the period. 
 Our Americas segment saw an increase in In-House revenues versus the comparable period. The region saw slightly weaker like-for-like In-House performance offset by the opening of Soho House Mexico City (September 2023), Soho House Portland (March 2024) and Soho House Sao Paulo (June 2024). 
 
 60 

In-House revenues in our United Kingdom segment increased slightly versus the comparative period driven by foreign exchange benefit with the underlying House performance being marginally worse versus fiscal 2023 due to underlying macroeconomic trends, further impacted by the closure of the rooftop at White City House for 11 weeks in the period due to refurbishments. 
 The Europe/RoW segment saw a decrease of In-House revenues year-on-year, driven by external factors resulting in a reduction in footfall in our Tel Aviv House versus comparative period, alongside room revenue declines across certain Houses. In addition, during the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2023, we recognized approximately 1,800 from the Dutch government related to COVID-19 subsidies and approximately 1,100 from a settlement to recover costs incurred on behalf of a former development partner in connection with a proposed European House opening, which impacts comparatives in Europe. 
 In constant currency, In-House Revenues decreased by 5,106, a decrease of 1 .

This increase is attributable increased trade volume in Soho Home and the opening of Scorpios Bodrum (June 2024), offset by the permanent closure of all but one of our Soho Restaurants, which excludes Cecconi's, at the start of fiscal 2023, the closure of The Hoxton, Shoreditch (July 2023), alongside Coachella event not being held during the current fiscal year.

 Other expenses increased by 12,113 to 13,738 for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, primarily due to 1,885 for one-time expenses related to shareholder activism, 2,424 of expenses incurred with respect to the evaluation of certain strategic transactions by our independent special committee and 6,137 incurred with respect to a strategic reorganization program of our operations and support teams. In addition, we recognized impairment losses on intangible assets related to the termination of two hotel management contracts of 4,710.

Interest Expense, net was 61,846 for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 2,319, or 4 , to the 39 weeks ended October 1, 2023, driven by the higher interest rate and principal on the Soho Beach House Miami loan post refinancing and the higher principal amount on our Senior Secured Notes due to the compounding of this debt, offset by the loss on extinguishments of debt incurred following the refinancing of Soho Beach House Miami in May 2023. In constant currency, net interest decreased by 498.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business operations. Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows, holdings of cash and cash equivalents and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 29, 2024, we maintained a cash and cash equivalents balance of 143 million and a restricted cash balance of 4 million. 
 
 Our primary requirements for liquidity are to fund our working capital needs, operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures and general corporate needs. Our ongoing capital expenditures are principally related to opening new Houses, refurbishing and maintaining the existing House portfolio as well as investments in our corporate technology infrastructure to support our digital strategy and technology infrastructure. 
 
 In a given year, our primary cash inflows and outflows relate to the following: 
 (1) from operating activities, our cash inflows include Membership revenues, In-House revenues and Other revenues, such as the sale of retail products. The primary cash outflows from operating activities include general operating expenses and interest payments. 

(2) from investing activities, our cash inflows include the proceeds from sale of property and equipment and distributions from equity method investments. The primary cash outflows from investing activities include the purchase of property and equipment as well as intangibles. 

(3) from financing activities, our cash inflows from financing activities include proceeds from borrowings and from the issuance of shares. The primary cash outflows from financing activities include repayments of borrowings and legal and professional fees from debt or equity related transactions, as well as, from time to time the repurchase of shares under board authorized repurchase plans. 

On February 9, 2024, the Company s board and a relevant sub-committee authorized and approved a new stock repurchase program for up to 50 million of the currently outstanding shares of the Company s Class A common stock. During the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of 2,269,130 shares of Class A common stock for 13 million and 3,160,175 shares for 17 million, respectively, including commissions, under the new program. The repurchased shares are held as treasury shares by the Company. 
 
 We believe our existing cash and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to fund our operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.

 Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations 
 As of September 29, 2024, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based on the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to: presenting only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley; having reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy or information statements; being exempt from the requirements to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or seek stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and not being required to adopt certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure s About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk has not materially changed from what was previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We principally operate in the UK and The Americas, although we have significant operations in Europe. Therefore, we are exposed to reporting foreign exchange risk in Pound sterling and Euros. 
 We have not, to date, used any material financial instruments to mitigate our foreign exchange risk. The directors and management will keep this situation under review. As income is received and suppliers paid in respect of the UK and European operation in Pound sterling or Euros, respectively, this acts as a natural hedge against foreign exchange risk. 
 If the USD had strengthened/weakened by 10 versus the GBP, revenue would have been approximately 6 million lower and approximately 7 million higher, respectively, and Net Loss would have been approximately less than 1 million higher and approximately less than 1 million lower, respectively, for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 If the Euro had strengthened/weakened by 10 versus the GBP, revenue would have been approximately 2 million higher and approximately 2 million lower, respectively, and Net Loss would have been approximately less than 1 million lower and approximately less than 1 million higher, respectively, for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 If the USD had strengthened/weakened by 10 versus the GBP, revenue would have been approximately 47 million lower and approximately 52 million higher, respectively, and Net Loss would have been approximately 3 million lower and approximately 3 million higher, respectively, for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 If the Euro had strengthened/weakened by 10 versus the GBP, revenue would have been approximately 13 million higher and approximately 11 million lower, respectively, and Net Loss would have been approximately less than 1 million lower and approximately less than 1 million higher, respectively, for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of loss from amounts owed by financial counter-parties. Credit risk can occur at multiple levels; as a result of broad economic conditions, challenges within specific sectors of the economy, or from issues affecting individual companies. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. 
 We maintain cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits held with banks, and money market funds that, at times, exceed federally or locally insured limits. We limit our credit risk by dealing with customers, counterparties and institutions that are considered to be of high credit quality and by performing periodic evaluations of accounts receivable and investments and of the relative credit standing of our customers, counterparties and financial institutions, as applicable. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 We seek to manage our financial risks to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our foreseeable needs. We believe we have significant flexibility to control our capital expenditure commitments in new House developments through different investment formats. As of September 29, 2024, we had 143 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, 4 million of restricted cash and 71 million 95 million) undrawn on the Revolving Credit Facility (subject to complying with our covenants) to meet our funding needs. 
 Cash Flow and Fair Value Interest Rate Risk 
 We have historically financed our operations through a mixture of bank borrowings and bond notes which are generally fixed, and expect to finance our operations through operating cash flows and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. We seek to manage exposure to adverse interest rate changes through our normal operating and financing activities. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation has an impact on food, utilities, labor, rent, and other costs which materially impact operations. Severe increases in inflation could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If several of the various costs in our business experience inflation at the same time, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. 
 Commodity Price Risks 
 We are exposed to commodity price risks specially foodstuffs, natural gas and oil. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food and beverages are commodities or are affected by the price of other commodities. Factors that affect the price of commodities are generally outside of our control and include foreign currency exchange rates, foreign and domestic supply and demand, inflation, weather, the geopolitical situation, and seasonality.

Item 4. Controls and Proce dures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management concluded that as of September 29, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As described in Note 17, Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements , included in this Form 10-Q, Management identified misstatements in its previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52-week period ended December 31, 2023 Fiscal 2023 and January 1, 2023 Fiscal 2022 the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the 13-week periods ended March 31, 2024 Q1 2024 )and April 2, 2023 Q1 2023 the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the 13-week and 26-week periods ended June 30,2024 Q2 2024 and July 2, 2023 Q2 2023 and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended October 1, 2023 Q3 2023 ). The Company assessed the materiality of the errors, including the presentation on prior period consolidated financial statements, on a qualitative and quantitative basis in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins SAB No. 99, Materiality, and No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements codified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The Company determined the impacts of these misstatements were not material to the financial statements for all prior periods identified above. For comparative purposes, the Company has made corrections to the condensed consolidated financial statements and applicable notes for the prior periods presented in this Form 10-Q. Further, the Company included details of the corrections on all impacted prior periods (as listed above) and financial statement line items in Note 17, Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements , in this Form 10-Q 
 As disclosed in our Annual Report in Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, based on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2023, because of the identification of two material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses related to (i) our lack of a sufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge and experience with the application of US generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and with our financial reporting requirements; and (ii) the fact that policies and procedures with respect to the review, supervision and monitoring of our accounting and reporting functions, including IT general controls, were either not designed and in place, or not operating effectively. These material weaknesses resulted in adjustments to our financial statements and included lease accounting, income tax accounting, impairment of long-lived assets accounting, related party transactions and disclosures and balance sheet reclassifications during the course of the audit process. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and our management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting also are based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

PART II OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Leg al Proceedings. 
 From time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. At present, we are not a party to any litigation other than litigation in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect that the ultimate outcome of any of the currently ongoing legal proceedings, individually or collectively, will have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of matters to which we are or could become subject could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors. 
 You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in section Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as described below. The risks described in our Annual Report Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not precisely known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also arise and materially impact our business. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. 
 We identified material weaknesses in connection with our internal control over financial reporting. Although we are taking steps to remediate these material weaknesses, there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so in a timely manner, or at all, and we may identify other material weaknesses. 
 In connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, our management and independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses related to (i) our lack of a sufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge and experience with the application of US generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and with our financial reporting requirements; and (ii) the fact that policies and procedures with respect to the review, supervision and monitoring of our accounting and reporting functions, including IT general controls, were either not designed and in place, or not operating effectively. These material weaknesses resulted in adjustments to our financial statements and included lease accounting, income tax accounting, impairment of long-lived assets accounting, related party transactions and disclosures and balance sheet reclassifications during the course of the audit process. 
 In connection with ongoing remediation efforts including the process of our replacement of our legacy financial system with a new ERP system, management identified misstatements and confirmed previously uncorrected immaterial misstatements in its previously issued financial statements for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, the interim periods within these fiscal years, Q1 2024 and Q2 2024 as a result of manual processes and the material weaknesses over our accounting and internal controls described above. 
 Remediation Efforts to Address the Previously Disclosed Material Weakness 
 The Company has devoted, and will continue to devote, significant time and resources to complete its remediation of the material weaknesses. The following components of the ongoing remediation plan, among others, are: 
 Further enhancing our staff's skill-level and number of accounting staff within the finance department, especially in the Americas 

Implementing a new ERP system that supports the transition away from manual processes and legacy systems 

Investing in and improving other finance and controls related technology 

Continuing to engage with external consultants to support the review and assist in strengthening the Company s internal controls and processes 

Further, the Company is focused on continuing to bolster its Transformation and Finance teams including by hiring a Chief Transformation Officer (November 2024) to lead the ERP system implementation and a number of personnel with a higher level of knowledge and experience including application of US GAAP, internal audit and SOX compliance. 
 The Company considers that the actions described above are comprehensive and will remediate the material weaknesses and strengthen the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Given the Company is still in the process of recruiting experienced accounting staff and implementing the new ERP system, the Company believes that additional time will be beneficial to demonstrate that the new personnel, in conjunction with the new system, have the ability to consistently perform their responsibilities to ensure that the material weaknesses have been fully remediated. Therefore, the Company has concluded that these material weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until the remediation actions, including those above, have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time and have been sufficiently tested. 
 As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. In addition, we are required to furnish a report by our management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Additional control deficiencies may in the future be identified by our management or independent registered public accounting firm, and such control deficiencies may also represent one or more material weaknesses in addition to those previously identified. We are currently in the process of remediating these material weaknesses and we are taking steps that we believe will address their underlying causes. We have enlisted the help of external consultants to provide assistance in the areas of internal controls and financial reporting in the short term, and are evaluating the longer-term resource needs of our accounting staff, including GAAP expertise. These remediation measures may be time-consuming and costly, and might place 
 73 

significant demands on our financial, accounting and operational resources. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be successful in hiring any necessary finance and accounting personnel in a timely manner, or at all. 
 Assessing our procedures to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process. We can provide no assurance that our remediation efforts described herein will be successful and that we will not have material weaknesses in the future. Any material weaknesses we identify could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements as well as subject us to increased regulatory inquiry and shareholder litigation.
