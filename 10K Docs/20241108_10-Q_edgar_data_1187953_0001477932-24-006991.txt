Overview We are a commercial stage biotechnology company dedicated to the advancement of identifying and translating novel biological therapeutics in the fields of immunotherapy, endocrinology, urology, neurology and orthopedics. Our platforms, therapies and products include the following: 15 Table of Contents Our subsidiary, Creative Medical Technologies, Inc. CMT ), was originally created to monetize U.S. Patent No. 8,372,797 and related intellectual property related to the treatment of erectile dysfunction ED ), which it acquired in February 2016. Subsequently, we have expanded our development and acquisition of intellectual property beyond urology to include therapeutic treatments utilizing re-programmed stem cells, and the treatment of neurologic disorders, lower back pain, Type-1 diabetes, and heart, liver, kidney, and other diseases using various types of stem cells through our ImmCelz, Inc., StemSpine, Inc. and AlloCelz LLC subsidiaries. However, neither ImmCelz Inc., nor AlloCelz LLC have commenced commercial activities. We currently conduct substantially all of our commercial operations through CMT, which markets and sells our CaverStem and FemCelz disposable kits utilized by physicians to perform autologous procedures that treat erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction, respectively. Our CaverStem and FemCelz kits are currently available through physicians at eight locations in the United States. In 2020, through our ImmCelz Inc. subsidiary, we began developing treatments under our ImmCelz platform (CELZ-100), that utilize a patient s own extracted immune cells that are then reprogrammed/supercharged by culturing them outside the patient s body with optimized cell-free factors. The immune cells are then re-injected into the patient from whom they were extracted. We believe this process endows the immune cells with regenerative properties (or supercharges them) providing them with the ability to treat multiple indications. We have validated this ability through the third-party studies described below that were independently conducted on selected human donor patient cells for accuracy and reproducibility. In contrast to other stem cell-based approaches, the immune cells are significantly smaller in size than stem cells and are believed to more effectively penetrate areas of the damaged tissues and induce regeneration. In June 2022, we signed an agreement with Greenstone Biosciences Inc. Greenstone for the development of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) pipeline for our ImmCelz platform. This project was identified as iPScelz . The efforts by Greenstone are expected to complement and expand our current work on novel therapeutic cell lines. In May 2023, we announced that we had received confirmation that Greenstone had successfully developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC). We estimate that the development of this cell line will save the Company two to three years in research and development time along with associated expenses. The final iPScelz results in a viral-free cell line which has great potential for differentiation into therapeutic biologics both for the cellular and cell-free programs along with targeted drug discovery. Greenstone s developments were confirmed by an independent, industry-leading research firm. 16 Table of Contents In October 2022, we announced the development of our AlloStem Clinical Cell Line (CELZ-200), a proprietary allogenic cell line which includes a Master Cell Bank and a Drug Master File. We believe we will able to use this cell line for many of our programs, including our ImmCelz immunotherapy platform for multiple diseases, OvaStem for Premature Ovarian Failure, Type I Diabetes (CELZ-201 CREATE-1), AlloStemSpine Chronic Lower Back Pain (CELZ-201 ADAPT), and IPScelz inducible pluripotent stem cell program in ongoing development with Greenstone. In November 2022, we announced that the FDA had cleared the Company s Type I Diabetes (CELZ-201 CREATE-1) Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes utilizing our AlloStem Clinical Cell Line, which will allow us to begin a Phase I/II clinical trial. The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate CELZ-201 treatment in patients with newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes. The trial has also received Institutional Board Review (IRB) approval for the trial to proceed as well as approval of the patient recruitment material. Patient recruitment was initiated in September 2023. In February 2023, the Company reported positive three-year follow-up data for its StemSpine pilot study. The three-year data demonstrates continued efficacy of the StemSpine procedure for treating chronic lower back pain without any serious adverse effects reported. In March 2023, we reported the following results of independent studies: ImmCelz (CELZ-100) platform required 75 fewer donor patient cells compared to industry standard. The purity of the final ImmCelz (CELZ-100) product was greater than 95 compared to the industry standard of greater than 80 . ImmCelz (CELZ-100) demonstrated a greater than 200 reduction in functional suppression of effector T cells, which are a critical concern for patients with autoimmune issues, while still possessing a high number of functional T regulatory cells. The ability to verify repeated potency of the final ImmCelz (CELZ-100) product. We believe these results show that we will be able to substantially reduce production costs, while allowing for the manufacture of the best clinical product for patients with immune disorders, which will enable us to accelerate our clinical applications and encourage potential collaborations with respect to our ImmCelz platform. In March 2023, the Company announced that it filed an application with the FDA to receive Orphan Drug Designation ODD for the treatment of Brittle Type 1 Diabetes using its ImmCelz (CELZ-100) platform. In March 2024, the Company received ODD for the treatment of Brittle Type 1 Diabetes from the FDA. This designation provides multiple important benefits to support the therapy's development including tax advantages, user fee exemptions, and the opportunity for market exclusivity following approval. In April 2023, the Company reported positive one-year follow-up data and significant efficacy using CELZ-001 to treat patients with Type 2 Diabetes. There were no safety concerns related to CELZ-001 at one year follow-up utilizing the same infusion procedure as in the currently U.S. FDA cleared Type I Diabetes (CELZ-201 CREATE-1) clinical trial. There were 30 patients in the study, 15 who received CELZ-001 and the rest received optimized medical therapy. At one year, there was an overall efficacy of 93 in the treated patients demonstrating at least a 50 reduction in insulin requirement. In September 2023, the Company received FDA clearance to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial of AlloStemSpine Chronic Lower Back Pain (CELZ-201 ADAPT) using AlloStem (CELZ-201-DDT) for the treatment of lower back pain. The first in country study, which will enroll 30 individuals suffering from chronic lower back pain, is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AlloStem (CELZ-201-DDT). The minimally invasive procedure uses ultrasound for the targeted delivery of the cell product, and thus prevents radiation exposure to the patient or the injecting physician. In October, 2023 we filed for and received approval from an institutional review board (IRB) to proceed with this trial. This trial, protected by issued patents, is a huge milestone for the Company and for patients suffering from this debilitating problem and their need for opioids for pain. 17 Table of Contents In March 2024, the Company secured FDA authorization for an expanded access therapy using CELZ-201, in managing abnormal glucose tolerance and preventing Type I Diabetes in high-risk individuals. The therapy uses CELZ-201 to potentially prevent Type I Diabetes onset and is believed to be a first in medical history. This personalized medicine approach, focuses on a single high-risk patient. CELZ-201 has a multi-target mechanism to address abnormal glucose tolerance, a Type I Diabetes precursor, at the cellular level. In June 2024, the Company announced that it has successfully generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived Islet Cells that produce human insulin. The Company believes this development has the potential for not only clinical translation of the human Islet Cells, but also the stand-alone human insulin which is produced by these cells. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company selected and contracted with the clinical trial site and Contract Research Organization (CRO), initiated the clinical trial site, launched subject recruitment and started dosing trial subjects on the Phase I/II clinical trial of AlloStemSpine Chronic Lower Back Pain (CELZ-201 ADAPT) using AlloStem (CELZ-201-DDT) for the treatment of lower back pain. In July 2024, the Company announced that it initiated a program to diagnose and treat patients exposed to biological and chemical weapons by combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Company s proprietary human induced pluripotent stem cells iPSC ). This iPSC clinical derived line is part of the Company s iPSCelz program. The program is designed to utilize the predictive capabilities of AI to identify damage to patients exposed to biological or chemical weapons and, based on a clinical diagnosis supported by that assessment, use the Company s validated iPSCelz, ImmCelz (CELZ-100) and/or AlloStem (CELZ-201-DDT) to develop optimized therapeutic options. The use of AI strengthens the Company s research efficiency, precision, and innovation. In drug discovery, AI accelerates the identification of potential targets and optimizes biological screenings, significantly shortening development timelines. This model enables the Company to accelerate development for civilian and military options for biological optimization of on-site and remote therapeutic interventions. Along with Greenstone Biosciences Inc., the Company continues to evaluate other collaborators, partners and business opportunities to accelerate development without taking away from the core clinical programs.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the United States. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 20 Table of Contents Item 3.
