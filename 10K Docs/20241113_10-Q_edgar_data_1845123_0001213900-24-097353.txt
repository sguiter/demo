ACQUISITION CORP. 
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

. The Company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization
or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a Business Combination ). The Company is not limited to a particular
industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth
company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from February 3, 2021 (inception)
through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company s formation, the initial public offering Initial Public Offering as described below, and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination.
The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company
will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company
has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

The
registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 14, 2021. On December 17, 2021,
the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A ordinary
shares included in the Units sold, the Public Shares at per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of ,
which is described in Note 4. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of warrants (the Private Placement
Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Swiftmerge Holdings, LP (the Sponsor and eleven qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors (the Anchor Investors generating gross
proceeds of , which is described in Note 5. 

On
January 18, 2022, the Company announced the closing of its sale of an additional Units pursuant to the partial exercise by
the underwriter of its over-allotment option (the Over-Allotment Option ). The Units were sold at an offering price of 
per Unit, generating gross proceeds of . Simultaneously with the partial exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, the Company
sold an additional Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering (including the closing of the Over-Allotment Option), an aggregate amount of 
was placed in the Company s trust account (the Trust Account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering,
invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with maturities of days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution
of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below. 

Transaction
costs related to the issuances described above amounted to , consisting of of cash underwriting fees, 
of deferred underwriting fees, for the excess fair value of Founder Shares attributable to the Anchor Investors (as described
in Note 6) and of other offering costs. 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward
consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.
The Company must complete a Business Combination with or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value
of at least of the value of the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned
on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into an initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business
Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act.

per Public Share, plus
any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations).
There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. The Public
Shares subject to redemption are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public
Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). 

The
Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least either prior to or
upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted
in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder
vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the
 Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business
Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval
for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy
rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination,
the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 6) and any Public Shares it holds purchased during or after the
Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their
Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. 

Notwithstanding
the above, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender
offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate
of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under
Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of
the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
Company s Sponsor, directors, advisors, Anchor Investors (as described in Note 6) and executive officers have agreed to waive (i)
redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business
Combination, (ii) redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with a shareholder
vote to amend the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to modify the substance or timing of the Company s
obligation to allow redemption in connection with an initial Business Combination or to redeem of their Public Shares if the Company
does not complete an initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, unless extended,
or with respect to any other material provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity and
(iii) rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held if the Company fails to complete
an initial Business Combination within months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, unless extended. However, if the Sponsor
acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from
the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering,
unless extended.

months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, unless extended, to complete a Business Combination (the
 Combination Period ). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company
will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than business thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the
Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay income
taxes, if any (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares,
which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further
liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
the Company s remaining shareholders and board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no
redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company
fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 

The
underwriter agreed to waive its rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 7) held in the Trust Account in the event
the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included
with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such
distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the initial
redemption amount of per share. 

In
November 2022, the Company obtained a waiver letter (the Waiver Letter from the underwriter that waived all rights to
the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter at the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination. 

On
June 15, 2023, the Company reconvened the extraordinary general meeting of the Company s shareholders, which had been adjourned from
June 12, 2023 (the June 2023 Meeting ). At the June 2023 Meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment
of the investment management trust agreement, dated December 17, 2021 (the Trust Agreement ), by and between the Company
and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company Continental ), to change the date on which Continental must commence
liquidation of the Trust Account to the earliest of (i) the Company s completion of an initial business combination or (ii) March
15, 2024. At the June 2023 Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company s Amended and
Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to provide the Company with the right to extend the date by which the Company must consummate
its initial Business Combination, from June 17, 2023 to March 15, 2024 and (ii) a proposal to provide for the right of a holder of the
Company s Class B ordinary shares to convert such shares into Class A ordinary shares on a basis at any time and from time
to time prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder (the Founder Share Amendment Proposal ). 

In
connection with the shareholders vote at the June 2023 Meeting, the holders of Class A ordinary shares properly exercised
their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount
of .

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Class B ordinary shares, converted
all of such shares into the same number of Class A ordinary shares. 

On
March 15, 2024, the Company reconvened the extraordinary general meeting of the Company s shareholders, which had been adjourned from
March 13, 2024 (the March 2024 Meeting ). At the March 2024 Meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved a second amendment
(the Second Trust Amendment of the Trust Agreement to change the date on which Continental must commence liquidation of
the Trust Account to the earliest of (i) the Company s completion of an initial business combination or (ii) June 17, 2025 the
Extension Date ). At the March 2024 Meeting, the Company s shareholders also approved a proposal to amend the Company s Amended
and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to provide the Company with the right to extend the date by which the Company must
consummate its initial Business Combination (the Extension ), from March 15, 2024 to June 17, 2025 (the Extension Amendment
Proposal ). 

In
connection with the shareholders vote at the March 2024 Meeting, the holders of Class A ordinary shares properly exercised
their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount
of approximately million. 

As
a result of the redemptions described above and the conversion of the Sponsor s Class B ordinary shares, there are an aggregate
of Class A ordinary shares outstanding. 

Under
Cayman Islands law, the amendments described above took effect immediately upon approval by the shareholders of the applicable Extension
Amendment Proposal, Trust Amendment Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal. 

In
order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent
any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company (other than the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement,
reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share
held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than per Public Share due to reductions
in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay tax obligations, provided that such liability
will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access
to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have
to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business,
execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

On
March 14, 2024, the Company and the Sponsor entered into non-redemption agreements (each, a Non-Redemption Agreement with
one or more unaffiliated third party or parties (the Investors in exchange for each such third party or third parties
agreeing not to redeem certain public Class A ordinary shares of the Company sold in its initial public offering (the Non-Redeemed
Shares at the March 2024 Meeting. In exchange for the foregoing commitments not to redeem such Non-Redeemed Shares, the Company
and the Sponsor agreed, among other items, that the Sponsor will assign an economic interest in certain of its Founder Shares to the
Investor at the rate of 3 Founder Shares for each 10 Non-Redeemed Shares. 

The
Non-Redemption Agreements increased the likelihood that the Extension Amendment Proposal would be approved by the Company s shareholders,
and increase the amount of funds that remain in the Trust Account following the March 2024 Meeting, relative to the amount of funds that
would be expected to be remaining in the Trust Account following the March 2024 Meeting had the Non-Redemption Agreements not been entered
into and the shares subject to such agreements had been redeemed.

and a working capital deficit of . 

Prior to
the completion of the Initial Public Offering, substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern existed
as the Company lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year
from the issuance date of the financial statements. The Company has since completed its Initial Public Offering at which time capital
in excess of the funds deposited in the Trust Account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to the Company for general working
capital purposes. 

Furthermore,
the Company will have until June 17, 2025 to complete a Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated by June 17,
2025 and an extension has not been effected, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. 

Based
on the historical and expected future cash outflows, the amounts held in the operating account will not provide the Company with sufficient
funds to meet its operational and liquidity obligations up to the expiration date of June 17, 2025.

Class A ordinary shares, of which Class A ordinary shares remain outstanding at September 30, 2024,
sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public
Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business
Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. In accordance
with ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption
to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, the Class A ordinary shares not under the control of the Company have been classified

to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A
ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject
to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless

when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis 
pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act; provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption,
or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.

a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more
businesses (our Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds
of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in
connection with our initial Business Combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following
the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to banks or other
lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. 

Our

amended, or the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined
by the company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as
described below. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination by June 17, 2025 we will: (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public
Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest
to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii)
as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of
directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law.

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from February 3,
2021 (inception) to September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering,
as described below, and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination.
We will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest.
We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held after the Initial Public Offering.
We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well
as due diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 77,178, which resulted from formation and operating costs of 256,436,
offset by a gain on investments held in the Trust Account of 179,258. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 347,967, which resulted from a gain on investments held in the Trust
Account of 1,198,052, offset by 850,085 of formation and operating costs. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 523,757, which resulted from formation and operating costs of 1,186,878,
offset by a gain on investments held in the Trust Account of 663,121. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we had net income of 2,931,022 ,
which resulted from a gain on investments held in the Trust Account of 6,212,416 , offset
by formation and operating costs of 3,281,394 . 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash held outside of the Trust Account of 9,520 and a working capital deficit of 4,208,803. 

Our liquidity needs up to September 30, 2024 had been satisfied through
a payment of 25,000 from the Sponsor to cover certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for the issuance of the Founder Shares,
a loan under the Promissory Note from our Sponsor of 149,172, and the net proceeds from the consummation of the private placement not
held in the Trust Account. The Promissory Note was repaid in full on December 21, 2021. On May 19, 2023, the Sponsor provided a 200,000
Advance to the Company. On September 15, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Note with the Sponsor
of up to 500,000 in the aggregate for costs and expenses reasonably related to the Company s working capital needs prior to the
consummation of the Business Combination and the Advance was converted into the first proceeds on the Note. This note was subsequently
amended for a principal balance of 600,000 in November 2023, an additional 85,000 in April 2024, and an additional 26,000 in May 2024.
The Company received an additional 295,000 from Sponsor in August 2024. The Note is non-interest bearing and is due the earlier of the
consummation of a business combination or the date of liquidation. The Sponsor may elect to convert all or any portion of the unpaid principal
balance of this Note into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant. As of September 30, 2024, the balance under the Note was 1,006,000.
As of September 30, 2024, the Sponsor did not elect to convert any of the principal to warrants. We expect that the estimated shortfall
in cash in the Company s operating account that is needed to fund the Company s operations through the closing of the Business
Combination is approximately 366,000, and the Company expects the Sponsor will make an additional loan to the Company to make up for
this shortfall. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an initial Business Combination, our officers, directors
and initial shareholders may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company with working capital loans. To date, there are no amounts
outstanding under any working capital loans. 

25 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 744,829, which was due to a gain on investments
held in the Trust Account of 663,121 and net loss of 523,757, offset by our changes in working capital of 442,049. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 792,137, which was due to a gain on investments
held in the Trust Account of 6,212,416, offset in part our net income of 2,931,022 and by changes in working capital of 2,489,257. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities of 11,325,822 represents the payment from the Trust
Account to redeeming shareholders. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities of 211,918,104 represents the payment from the Trust
Account to redeeming shareholders. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities of 10,719,822 due to payments to redeeming share holders
of 11,325,822, partially offset by cash inflow from related party promissory note of 406,000, and proceeds from related party loans
of 200,000. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of 211,518,104 due to payments to redeeming share holders
of 211,918,104, partially offset by cash inflow from related party promissory note of 400,000. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 9,520 held outside the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account
primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents
and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. Management plans
to address liquidity uncertainty through a Business Combination or extension as discussed above. There is no assurance that the Company s
plans to consummate a Business Combination or extension will be successful. While management expects to have sufficient access to additional
sources of capital if necessary, there is no current confirmed financing commitment, and no assurance can be provided that such additional
financing will become available to the Company. 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor
or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. If
the Company completes an initial Business Combination, the Company may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account
released to the Company. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that we do
not consummate an initial Business Combination, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to
repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to 1,500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.
The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. To date, there were no amounts outstanding under any of these loans. 

26 

Based
on the liquidity condition and the mandatory liquidation, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued.
Management plans to address this uncertainty through a Business Combination or extension as discussed above. There is no assurance that
the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination or extension will be successful. While management expects to have sufficient
access to additional sources of capital if necessary, there is no current confirmed financing commitment, and no assurance can be provided
that such additional financing will become available to the Company. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a monthly fee of up to 1,000 for office space and administrative support to the Company, which the
Sponsor waived on September 27, 2024. 

Registration
and Shareholder Rights Agreement 

The
holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and
any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants issued upon conversion of the working
capital loans) have registration and shareholder rights to require the Company to register a sale of any of its securities held by them
pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement entered into on the date of the Initial Public Offering. The holders of these
securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition,
the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the
completion of an initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such
registration statements. 

Promissory
Note - Related Party 

On
May 19, 2023, the Sponsor provided a 200,000 advance to the Company. On September 15, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory
note with the Sponsor of up to 500,000 in the aggregate for costs and expenses reasonably related to the Company s working capital
needs prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and the Advance was converted into the first proceeds on the Note. The note
was subsequently amended for a principal balance of 600,000 in November 2023 and for an additional 85,000 in April 2024. The Note is
non-interest bearing and is due the earlier of the consummation of a business combination or the date of liquidation. At anytime, at
the option of the Sponsor. the Sponsor may elect to convert all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of this Note into warrants,
at a price of 1.00 per warrant. Also, there was an additional draw in May 2024 for 26,000, and 295,000 in August 2024. As of September 30,
2024, the balance under the Note was 1,006,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Sponsor did not elect to convert any of the principal
to warrants. 

Due
to Related Party 

The
Company had 200,000 and 0 due to related party as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. The amount as of September
30, 2024 relates to advisory services provided to the Company during the year.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates: 

Warrant
Classification 

The Company
accounts for the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the private placement in accordance with the guidance
contained in ASC 815-40 under which the warrants meet the criteria for equity treatment and are recorded as equity. 

Ordinary
Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

All
of the 22,500,000 Class A ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering (and including the Units sold in connection
with the underwriters partial exercise of the Over-Allotment Option) contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption
of such public shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection
with the initial Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of
Association. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares
subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all Class A ordinary shares have been classified outside
of permanent equity. 

The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares
to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary
shares are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. The redemption value of the redeemable ordinary
shares as of September 30, 2024 increased as the income earned on the Trust Account exceeds the Company s expected dissolution
expenses (up to 100,000). As such, the Company recorded an increase in the carrying amount of the redeemable ordinary shares of 663,121
as of September 30, 2024. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic
740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax
disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investor requests for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to
the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2024, and early adoption is permitted. The accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial
statements and related disclosures.

March 15, 2024 the Company reconvened the extraordinary general meeting of the Company s shareholders, which had been adjourned from
March 13, 2024 (the March 2024 Meeting ). At the meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved a second amendment (the
 Second Trust Amendment of that certain investment management trust agreement, dated December 17, 2021, as amended on June

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

ITEM
4. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer (our certifying
officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our certifying officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to remaining unremediated material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting
related to lack of formal review controls, as required by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) principles over the accounting
for complex financial instruments, to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting reporting disclosures, resulting in
adjustments to several accounts and disclosures. In addition to the material weakness noted above, the Company has an ongoing material
weakness related to the recording of an unbilled amount due to a third-party service providers, failure to timely remove liability associated
with the deferred underwriting fees, and interest income during the preparation of our annual report on Form 10-K as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2022. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our
annual financial statements were prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements
included in this Report present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
period presented. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
