materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. 

You
should refer to Risk Factors of this Report for a discussion of important factors that may cause our actual results to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you
that the forward-looking statements in this Report will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to
be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should

cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in this
Report. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance.

as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements are made as of the date we file this Report, and are based on information and estimates

through retained earnings, secured loans and a revolving line of credit. The Company s line of credit was scheduled to expire on July

10). The loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity
to fund its operations and operating capital needs for the next 12 months as well as meet its obligations as they become due in 2024
and 2025.

If
an entity is determined to be a VIE, the Company evaluates whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis
is a qualitative analysis based on power and economics. The Company consolidates a VIE if both power and benefits belong to the Company
- that is, the Company (i) has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly influence the VIE s economic
performance (power), and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially
be significant to the VIE (benefits). The Company consolidates VIEs whenever it is determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary. 

The
Company has determined that ZDM and Zircon UK are variable interest entities with the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Zircon, as the
primary beneficiary, and thus the Company, with the ability to exercise control, as determined under the guidance of ASC 810. In its
determination, management considered the following qualitative and quantitative factors: 

a. the
 overall purpose and design of the entities, which exist primarily for the benefit of or on
 behalf of the Company and; 

b. the
 Company s contractual and common control arrangements with the VIEs, through which
 it gains both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic
 performance, and the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits that potentially could
 be significant to the VIEs; 

c. the
 equity at risk of the entities is not sufficient to finance the entities activities without
 additional subordinated financial support by the Company (i.e., the entities are thinly capitalized).

issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of stockholders equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification,
the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured
at fair value and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash

12 of the Exchange Act to, directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary, extend or maintain credit in the form of a personal
loan to or for any director or executive officer of the Company. In March 2022, Zircon Corporation, the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary, loaned our chief executive officer funds to pay certain tax obligations, which was still outstanding when we acquired Zircon
in April 2023, which may have violated Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act as a result of the transition from private to public company
accounting. The loan was repaid in August 2023 as soon as management became aware of the possible violation. The loan repayment was made
by means of an offset to beneficial amounts of our chief executive officer in certain loans to the Company to which offset he did not
object. Issuers that are found to have violated Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act may be subject to civil sanctions, including injunctive
remedies and monetary penalties, as well as criminal sanctions. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies , no amounts have been
accrued for a loss contingency as it is not estimable as of September 30, 2024. The imposition of any of such sanctions on us could have

31, 2024 was 14.1 million. The increase of 0.1 million was driven primarily by an increase in accounts receivable of 0.6, an increase

of 0.9 million. To date the Company has been financed primarily through retained earnings, loans and credit lines secured by accounts
receivable, inventory and fixed assets. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity and access to loans and credit lines to
fund its operations and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. 

On
May 31, 2024, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with FGI Worldwide LLC, as Agent
for the lender FGI ). The Credit Agreement provides for a 15 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit
Facility available to be used by the Company, Zircon and its Affiliates for replacement and discharge of the Company s
current US Bank loan of 8,750,000 and matures on May 31, 2027. The Company, Zircon and the Affiliates are guarantors of all obligations
under the Credit Agreement and the Company s four principal shareholders are limited guarantors thereof. 

The
Credit Agreement stipulates a base rate measured by the sum of Term SOFR for a period of one month, as published by the CME Group Benchmark
Administration Limited (or any successor administration of Term SOFR) two business days prior to the beginning of the calendar month
and a percentage equal to 0.10 (10 basis points) per annum. If at any time the displayed Term SOFR is less than 0.00 , Term SOFR is
deemed to be 0.00 for the purposes of the credit facility. 

The
Credit Agreement bears interest measured by such outstanding amounts on receivable advances and inventory advances that accrue interest
at the greater of 5.25 per annum or 3.00 above the base rate. Interest is charged on the last day of each month on a daily net balance
of funds advanced or otherwise charged to the Company. 

The
Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with maximum total net leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. As of
September 30, 2024 the Company had a liability of approximately 9.3 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement and was
compliant with the maximum total net leverage and but not the fixed charge coverage ratio. The Company is working with the lender to get a waiver regarding the fixed charge coverage ratio.

an entity which is owned by certain shareholders of Zircon. Under the terms of the agreement, Zircon provides materials, technical assistance,
and expertise to the Contractor, and the Contractor assembles certain of Zircon s products. 

In
September 2017, an affiliated company, Zircon Corporation Limited, was established in the United Kingdom to facilitate the sale of Zircon s
products to European customers and operations began during the year ended March 31, 2019. The ownership structure of the affiliate is
similar to the ownership of the premerger ownership of Zircon.

The
Company leases from the Stauss Family Administrative Trust a 14,000 square foot facility owned by the Trust. 

The
Company has notes payable to the Stauss Family Administrative Trust to repay loans made to the Company. As of March 31, 2024, principal
balance of 0.7 million is due and payable in December 2025. Interest accrued at 5.5 per annum is paid quarterly and included in accrued
expenses. The note is subordinated to the line of credit note payable to the bank and no payment is to be made on the note without prior
approval from the bank. In the second quarter of 2023, a portion of the note payable to Stauss Family Administrative Trust was settled
as a non-cash transaction against the note receivable from one stockholder for 0.2 million. For the three and six months ended September
30, 2024, the interest expense on notes payable to the Stauss Family Administrative Trust totaled less than 0.1 million, respectively. 

For
the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, the interest expense on notes payable to the Stauss Family Administrative Trust totaled
less than 0.1 million, respectively. 

On
March 31, 2024 the Stauss Family Administrative Trust and the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the Notes Payable to the
trust to December 31, 2025. 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company made a distribution of 0.7 million to certain related party shareholders and one director
shareholder for taxes due resulting from the Company converting from an S corporation to a C corporation. 0.3 million of this distribution
was in cash and the remaining 0.4 million is recorded in accrued expenses on the balance sheet. During October 2024 the Company made
a cash distribution of approximately 0.4 million to settle the remaining liability. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

ZRCN
has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Estimates,
Judgments and Assumptions 

ZRCN
prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts of its assets and liabilities, the information provided with regard to future assets and liabilities as well
as the amounts of revenues and expenses for the relevant periods. Readers are invited to refer to Note 3 of the financial statements
for the three months ended June 30, 2024, for details. 

QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest
Rate and Foreign Currency Risk 

Interest
Rate Risk 

ZRCN s
exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to Zircon s cash, cash equivalents and outstanding debts. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Risk 

ZRCN
sources parts from foreign vendors and sells its products in various foreign markets around the world. Changes in foreign currency exchange
for the purchase of components from vendors and the sale of products in foreign markets can have a material impact on the Company s
results of operations and liquidity. The Company hedge or take other steps to mitigate the impact from foreign currency exchange rates,
but there is no guarantee that these efforts will be successful in every instance.

Controls
and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
accounting and financial officer has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as
of such date as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to inadequate segregation of duties
within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT and financial reporting
and record keeping. Under the direction of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we continue to develop
a plan to remediate the material weaknesses. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. 

As
of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting
had material weaknesses that lack adequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting, IT and financial reporting and record keeping and we are implementing plans to improve such internal
control. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

A stay, placed on Zircon s
patent infringement suit filed against Stanley Black Decker, Inc. in the Federal District Court in the Northern District of California
in December 2019, was released on May 8, 2024 following disposition of the International Trade Commission ITC matter between
the parties filed by Zircon. The parties met and conferred and participated in a Court supervised mediation on September 18, 2024 that
resulted in a Settlement Agreement entered into on October 15, 2024. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Zircon and Stanley provided
releases to one another and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates and Stanley received a fully paid patent license under certain
Zircon patents in exchange for payment to Zircon of 0.8 million and dismissal with prejudice of the subject litigation. The payment has
been made and dismissal filed. The matter is closed. 

Claim
Asserted by Mr. Michael Green 

In
April 2024, Mr. Michael Green, an individual in Great Britain, asserted violation by Zircon in its U.S. website of certain privacy protections
under the laws of Great Britain. The Company believes its U.S. website has not violated the laws of Great Britain and that, in any event,
has responded stating such laws do not apply outside Great Britain. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mr. Green
has not responded to the Company and has not asserted any claim for damages.
