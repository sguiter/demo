ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes to those financial
statements that are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations
that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events
could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such
as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, 
 expect, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, 
 predict, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Any statement contained in this report that is
not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the plans, objectives, expectations
and prospects reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements involve risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that our plans, objectives,
expectations and prospects will be achieved.. 

Overview 

The
Company was incorporated as Alternative Energy Environmental Solutions, Inc. in the State of Nevada on June 10, 2010,
to develop and license an innovative biotechnology for the environmentally friendly and cost-effective extraction of natural gas (coalbed
methane) from low-producing, depleted and abandoned coal mines in the U.S. The Company was not successful in developing this business
and discontinued its biotechnology related operations. The Company changed its name in 2014 to Unique Growing Solutions, Inc. and again
in 2015 to Point of Care Nano-Technology, Inc. 

On
February 25, 2015, the Company entered into the License Agreement with Lamina relating to intellectual property for diagnosing illness
in humans via a saliva test. During the past few years, the Company did not have the financial resources to pursue business development
relating to the Lamina license and this business was discontinued and split off. 

On
April 11, 2022, we, through our newly established, wholly owned subsidiary, DSI, acquired an exclusive license from Cedoga to distribute
in the USA, Canada and Mexico, certain intellectual property of Cedoga relating to animal nutrition and animal supplements. On April
19, 2022, we, through DSI, signed an exclusive representative and sublicensing agreement with Lucy Pet Products Inc. pursuant to which
Lucy has agreed to manufacture, market and distribute on our behalf pet products created from the Cedoga IP. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful marketing the Cedoga IP or that Lucy or other sublicensees of the Cedoga IP will be successful in their business
development efforts. 

Recent
Activities 

On
May 30, 2024, we engaged and executed an agreement with Fruci Associates II Fruci ), PLLC as our new independent

On
May 20, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Agreement with Point of Care Nano-Technology, LLC Point ).
Point was the company (unrelated to us) that Dr. Raouf Guirguis established to operate the business that Dr. Guirguis took back as a
result of the consummation of the Spin Off Agreements (discussed below). Pursuant to this Agreement we agreed to acquire (the Acquisition substantially all of the North American assets of Point (the Assets ), consisting primarily of proprietary information and
know-how for the developing and commercialization of kits for drug testing and to diagnose illnesses through the testing of human saliva,
referred to as the EZ Saliva test kits, and cash in the amount of 101,400. 

In
exchange for the Assets, we issued to Point and/or its designees 66,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock (the Consideration
Shares ).

Upon
the closing of the Acquisition, which effected a change of control of the Company, Dr. Raouf Guirguis, the controlling member of Point,
became a director of the Company and Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Guirguis also acquired, directly and indirectly, 34,596,800 of the
Consideration Shares, or approximately 48.4 of the shares of our common stock outstanding after completion of the Acquisition. Mr. Nathan
Keele, an associate of Dr. Guirguis and responsible for marketing efforts at Point, also was appointed to the board of directors of the
Company. Mr. Keele will continue his marketing efforts at the Company. Mr. Keele acquired 18,903,200 of the Consideration Shares, or
approximately 26.5 of the shares of our common stock outstanding after completion of the Acquisition. 

Nicholas
DeVito, our controlling stockholder prior to the Acquisition through the 1,000 shares of our super-majority class A preferred stock (the
 Preferred Stock that he held and through which he exercised eighty percent (80 voting control over the Company, surrendered
to us for cancellation the Preferred Stock and received, in exchange, 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. Mr. DeVito will retain his
positions as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary as well as his status as a member of our board
of directors. 

The
shares of Company common stock issued in connection with the Acquisition (as described above) were issued in accordance with a private
placement exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are considered restricted
securities. 

In
connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a license agreement (the License Agreement with Zeus Diagnostics, LLC Zeus ), a Delaware limited liability company controlled by Dr. Guirguis, pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive, in
perpetuity, license, with a right to sublicense, in the Territory (Canada, the United States and Mexico) the Zeus Know-How 
which consists of all information related to the manufacture and commercialization of saliva tests derived from patents owned by Zeus.
We paid Zeus a one-time, non-refundable up-front cash fee of 35,000 (which is creditable against other payments due) and will pay Zeus
a royalty on Net Sales (as defined in the License Agreement) of seven and one-half Percent (7.5 during each calendar
quarter. 

Following
the closing of the Acquisition, our business has begun to focus on the EZ Saliva product commercialization activity previously carried
on by Point. 

The
description of the agreement discussed above does not purport to be complete and the reader should refer to the full text of the agreements
as exhibits to our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on June 10, 2024.

shareholder pursuant to which it agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of GFG, consisting of assets relating to the sugar
substitute that GFG has been developing, Jaca . In exchange for the Jaca related assets, the Company will issue to GFG

of control of the Company, Peter Ferrari, the principal of the controlling member of GFG, will become the CEO and a director of the Company
and Nicholas DeVito, the current CEO and controlling stockholder of the Company though the 1,000 shares of super-majority Class A Preferred
Stock that he holds, will retain his positions with the Company as Treasurer, Secretary and Chief Financial Officer and director, and
he will exchange his Class A Preferred shares for 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company. The closing of this acquisition
is contingent upon, among other things, GFG s raising a minimum of 1,500,000 to be contributed to the Company upon closing as
part of the purchased assets, for working capital purposes. There can be no assurances that GFG will be able to raise these funds or
that this acquisition will successfully close.

the Securities Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management
necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Based
on that evaluation, as of January 31, 2024, our interim principal executive and financial officer identified the following material weaknesses: 

We
 do not have sufficient and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience
 in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.
 To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on the use of external legal and accounting professionals. 

Our
management has identified the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses, and as soon as we have available funds, we will implement
the following remedial procedures: 

We
 will hire personnel with technical accounting expertise to further support our current accounting personnel. As necessary, we will
 continue to engage consultants or outside accounting firms in order to ensure proper accounting for our financial statements.

We
intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable but we can give no assurance that
we will be able to do so. Designing and implementing an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires
us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources
to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken
and intend to take may not fully address the material weaknesses that we have identified, and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls
and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we discover such conditions, we intend to remediate them as soon as practicable.
We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation, as needed. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our interim principal executive and financial officer,
Nicholas DeVito, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during
the quarter ended January 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our acting principal executive and financial officer concluded there were no such
changes during the quarter ended January 31, 2024.
