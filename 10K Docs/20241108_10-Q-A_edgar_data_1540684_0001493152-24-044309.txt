CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions
for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements
of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding
current expectations, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, our future results of operations and financial position, our ability to
effectively process our minerals and achieve commercial grade at scale; risks and hazards inherent in the mining business (including
risks inherent in exploring, developing, constructing and operating mining projects, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, weather
or geologically related conditions); uncertainty about our ability to obtain required capital to execute our business plan; our ability
to hire and retain required personnel; changes in the market prices of lithium and lithium products and demand for such products; the
uncertainties inherent in exploratory, developmental and production activities, including risks relating to permitting, zoning and regulatory
delays related to our projects; uncertainties inherent in the estimation of lithium resources. These statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from
any future results, performance or achievement expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, 
 should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, 
 target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, 
 predict, potential, or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar
expressions Factors that could cause future results to materially differ from the recent results or those projected in
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover
mineral deposits, but also from finding mineral deposits that, though present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a
profit from production; market fluctuations; government regulations, including regulations relating to permitting, royalties,
allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection; competition; the loss of services of key
personnel; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, litigation, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or
provision of infrastructure as well as general economic conditions. 

The
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events
and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described under the sections in this Quarterly
Report titled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and other of our filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. The risk factors contained in our 2023 Annual Report are updated by us from time to time in
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other filings that we make with the SEC. 

You
should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report completely and with the understanding
that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Given these uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

Right
of use ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the
future lease payments over the lease term. When the rate implicit to the lease cannot be readily determined, we utilize our incremental
borrowing rate in determining the present value of the future lease payments. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made and lease
incentives received prior to the commencement date. Operating lease ROU assets also include any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent when
the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term. The ROU assets and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate
the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. The ROU and lease liabilities are primarily related to commercial
offices with third parties. 

The
lease agreements have terms between to years and the liability was measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted
using interest rates with a weighted average rate of which was determined to be the Company s incremental borrowing rate.

On
December 20, 2022, the Company made the appropriate filings with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada SOS that
were intended to effect the Originally Intended Reverse Stock Split (the Original Articles Amendment ). In April 2023, the

of the Company to take corrective action to remedy the inaccuracy and to file the documents that would have been necessary to effectuate
a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding common stock with a corresponding split of the authorized common stock
(the Rectified Reverse Stock Split and then immediately thereafter increase the number of shares of authorized common

articles of incorporation to decrease the number of shares of authorized common stock to two hundred million and to amend
certain other provisions in the Company s articles (the Amended and Restated Articles ). The Board and
the Majority Stockholder determined to decrease the number of shares of authorized common stock to reduce the number of shares available
for issuance given the negative perception the dilutive effect of having such a large number of shares available for issuance may have
on any potential future efforts to attract additional financing. On April 21, 2023, the Board and the Majority Stockholder approved the
Amended and Restated Articles. On May 25, 2023, the Company made the appropriate filings with the SOS to effect the changes as described

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated
financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly
Report and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 

This
Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section
entitled Risk Factors in Item 1.A. of Part II of this Report that could cause actual results could differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for any period in the future. 

Overview 

Atlas
Lithium Corporation Atlas Lithium , the Company , we , us , or
 our refer to Atlas Lithium Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries) is a mineral exploration and development
company with a developing lithium project and multiple lithium exploration properties. In addition, we own exploration properties
in other battery minerals, including nickel, copper, rare earths, graphite, and titanium. Our current focus is the development from
exploration to future active mining of our hard-rock lithium project located in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil at a well-known
pegmatitic district in Brazil, which has been denominated by the government of Minas Gerais as Lithium Valley. We
intend to mine and then process our lithium-containing ore to produce lithium concentrate (also known as spodumene concentrate), a
key ingredient for the battery supply chain. 

We
are building a modular plant targeted at producing up to 150,000 tons of lithium concentrate per annum tpa in what
we describe as Phase I. We plan on adding additional modules to the plant with the intent of doubling its production capacity to
up to 300,000 tpa in Phase II. However, there can be no assurance that we will have the necessary capital resources to develop such
facility or, if developed, that we will reach the production capacity necessary to commercialize our products and with the quality
needed to meet market demand. 

All
our mineral projects and properties are located in Brazil, a well-established mining jurisdiction. Our lithium properties include approximately 53,942
hectares (539 km 2 divided in 95 mineral rights (2 in pre-mining concession stage, 85 in exploration stage, and 8 in pre-exploration
stage). 

In addition,
we also have a few additional lithium mineral rights that are in the process of being acquired and not yet titled in our name. 

30 

 Table of Contents 

We
are primarily focused on advancing and developing our hard-rock lithium project located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Our Minas
Gerais Lithium Project MGLP consists of 85 mineral rights spread over approximately 468 km 2 and predominantly
located within the Brazilian Eastern Pegmatitic Province which has been surveyed by the Brazilian Geological Survey and is known for
the presence of hard rock formations known as pegmatites which contain lithium-bearing minerals such as spodumene and petalite. Our primary
area of focus is the Neves Project, which is part of MGLP. The Neves Project has been drilled extensively and presents spodumene-bearing
deposits amenable to open pit mining, with generation of ore material that can be processed by dense media separation technique to yield
lithium concentrate, a commercial product within the battery supply chain. 

We
own approximately 47.58 of the shares of common stock of Apollo Resources, a private company primarily focused on the development
of its initial iron mine. 

We
also own approximately 22.30 of the shares of common stock of Jupiter Gold, a company with an operating quartzite quarry and gold projects in exploration phase, the common stock of which is quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol JUPGF. 

The
results of operations from both Apollo Resources and Jupiter Gold are consolidated in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. 

Operational
Update 

During the second quarter of 2024, Atlas Lithium achieved
important milestones across several key operational areas including: 

Geotechnical
 drilling program in the Neves Project advanced to approximately 80 completion as of June 30, 2024, with full completion expected by
 end of August 2024. This program provides crucial data for mine planning and design. 

Metallurgical
 studies for both Anitta 2 and Anitta 3 deposits within the Neves Project were successfully completed. 

The core
 components of the modular dense media separation (DMS) lithium processing plant underwent trial assembly and are in the process of being packaged for
 shipment. Atlas Lithium has designed its processing plant as a series of compact, preassembled modules, an approach that appears to have
 never before been used for lithium processing in Brazil. This modular configuration reduces the plant s physical footprint
 compared to traditional designs. It will also enable more efficient transportation, installation, and commissioning. 

SAP
 enterprise software was successfully installed. 
 
 In
 June 2024, Apollo Resources received from the state regulatory authority a 10-year license
 to mine its iron ore property in the Iron Quadrangle region of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
 
 In
 July 2024, a U.S. company ordered polished quartzite slabs from Jupiter Gold s quartzite production. Such slabs are expected
 to be shipped in August 2024, marking the first sale of polished quartzite slabs from Jupiter Gold as an exporter.

Results
of Operations 

The
Six Months Ended June 30, 2024, compared to the Six Months ended June 30, 2023 

Net
loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024, totaled 23,137,504, compared to net loss of 13,862,249 during the six months ended June
30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to: 

After a trial mining period in the second half of 2023,
 Jupiter Gold started its continuing operations at its quartzite quarry in 2024. The gross margin of 180,256 was generated from the
 sales of 269 m 3 of unprocessed blocks of quartzite from its own production. Considering the start of operations in 2024, there was no gross
 margin generation in the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Higher
 general and administrative expenses of approximately 3.4 million in the period primarily due to increased costs of labor and consultants
 related to technical services, increased legal fees relating to transactions consummated during the quarter and other third-party
 costs; 

An
 increase of approximately 7.8 million in stock-based compensation expense compared to the prior period, reflecting bonus for the
 members of the management team eligible for stock-based compensation; and 

Higher
 finance costs of approximately 0.7 million for the period mainly due to interest expenses related to convertible notes issued in November 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 32,267,730 and working capital of 27,067,961. 

Net
cash used by operating activities totaled 11,292,221 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided of
 11,033,491 during the six months ended June 30, 2023, representing a variation in the cash flow from operating activities of 22,325,715. The
variation in net cash used /provided by operating activities was mainly due to: 

In the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company received 20,000,000 arising from the one-time royalty sale with
no matchable transaction in 2024 as explained in Note 3. 

Increase
 of approximately 3,500,000 in general and administrative expenses due to the increase in the Company s structure as it moves towards operations. As a result of that the Company had more
expenditures with employees compensation and costs with third parties service providers such as technical consultants;

 Table of Contents 

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled 16,777,111 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net cash used of 1,929,812
during the six months ended June 30, 2023, representing an increase in cash used of 14,847,299 or 769 . The increase reflects the payments
made in connection with the acquisition of the components of our lithium processing plant and capitalized exploration costs. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled 30,140,298 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 10,675,118 during the
six months ended June 30, 2023, representing an increase in cash provided of 19,465,180 or 182 . The increase is mainly due to the
following financing activities that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2023: 

The
 sale of an aggregate of 1,871,250 shares of our common stock to Mitsui in a private placement (the Private Placement ). The gross proceeds from the Private Placement were 30.0 million. 

For
further information on the transaction mentioned above, please refer to note 7 related parties transactions. 

We
have historically incurred net operating losses and have not yet generated material revenues from the sale of products or services.
As a result, our primary sources of liquidity have been derived through proceeds from the (i) sales of our equity and the equity of
one of our subsidiaries, and (ii) issuance of convertible debt. As of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 32,267,730
and working capital of 27,067,091, compared to cash and cash equivalents 29,549,927 and a working capital of 23,809,637 as of
December 31, 2023. We believe our cash and cash and equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of these financial statements. However, our future
short- and long-term capital requirements will depend on several factors, including but not limited to, the rate of our growth, our
ability to identify areas for mineral exploration and the economic potential of such areas, the exploration and other drilling
campaigns needed to verify and expand our mineral resources, the successful installation of our lithium processing facilities, and the ability to attract talent to manage our different areas of
endeavor. To the extent that our current resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may need to seek additional
equity or debt financing. If the needed financing is not available, or if the terms of financing are less desirable than we expect,
we may be forced to scale back our existing operations and growth plans, which could have an adverse impact on our business and
financial prospects and could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Currency
Risk 

We
operate primarily in Brazil, which exposes us to currency risks. Our business activities may generate intercompany receivables or payables
that are in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. Changes in exchange rates from the time the activity occurs
to the time payments are made may result in it receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent at
the time of the original activity. 

Our
consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign
currency and the U.S. dollar affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes
of reporting in the consolidated financial statements. Our foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from the local currency
into U.S. dollars in the following manner: (a) income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period; (b)
balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates; and (c) equity accounts are translated at
historical exchange rates. Translation in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency
translation adjustment account. This account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries U.S. dollar balance sheets and is necessary
to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets in agreement.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of American U.S. GAAP ).
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe
that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements
is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.

The

Item
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the design, operation,
and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of June 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
 that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure . In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. On the basis of that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer concluded that as a result of the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting, described
in our Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, filed on Form 10-K/A with the SEC
on November 8, 2024 (the Form 10-K/A ), our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that materially affected,
or would be reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
of the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constrains and that management is required to apply judgement in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
