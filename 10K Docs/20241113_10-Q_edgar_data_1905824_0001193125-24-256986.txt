Investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that the Company makes directly to investors or through reports that the Company has filed or will file with the SEC, including our registration statement on Form 10 and our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Investors should understand that under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to forward-looking statements made in periodic reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act. Overview The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), on July 11, 2022. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on December 23, 2021. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected, as of August 1, 2022, to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The Company s investment objectives are to generate current income and to a lesser extent longer-term capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in privately negotiated loans and equity investments to middle-market companies generally with annual revenues greater than 20 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA of less than 50 million. To accomplish this, the Company plans to make direct investments in middle-market companies. The Company may make select investments in non-U.S. portfolio companies. The Company seeks to provide investors with access to: 

a diversified portfolio of credit investments expected to provide stable income and high assurances of debt repayment; 

current income distributions; 

capital protection through defensive structures with affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and active portfolio management; 

assets of varying vintage, industry and geography through direct originations and acquisitions of loan portfolios; and 

generally low volatility and low correlation to public market indices. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company primarily invests in directly originated senior secured term loans including first lien senior secured term loans (including unitranche loans), second lien senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt, unsecured loans, other subordinated loans, and covenant-lite loans. The Company invests to a lesser degree in equity investments and other opportunistic asset purchases. The Company may engage in hedging transactions. The Company may also make investments in traded bank loans and other liquid debt securities of U.S. corporate issuers, including broadly syndicated loans, which may provide more liquidity than the Company s private credit investments. Depending on various factors, including, without limitation, the Company s cash flows, the state of the loan market, and the need to quickly ramp-up the Company s portfolio, the Company expects that at times its liquid loan portfolio could represent a material portion of the Company s portfolio.

The Company generates revenues primarily in the form of interest income from investments it holds. In addition, the Company generates income from dividends or distributions of income on any direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of loans and equity securities and various other loan origination and other fees, including commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Key Components Of Our Results Of Operations Investments The Company s level of investment activity can, does, and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments the Company makes. Revenues The Company generates revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments it holds. In addition, the Company generates income from dividends or distributions on income on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. The Company s debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR. Interest on these debt investments is paid quarterly. In some instances, the Company receives payments on its debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, the Company may receive repayments of some of its debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments is expected to fluctuate significantly from period to period. The Company s portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. The Company may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to contractual terms. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgement. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgement, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. Expenses The Company s primary operating expenses include the payment of: (i) investment advisory fees to the Advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement between the Company and the Advisor (unless waived); (ii) administrative fees payable to the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement between the Company and the Administrator; and (iii) other operating expenses as detailed below:

Portfolio, Investment Activity And Results Of Operations As of September 30, 2024, the Company had investments, excluding cash equivalents, in 34 portfolio companies across 16 industries. Based on fair value as of September 30, 2024, approximately 71 of the Company s debt portfolio was invested in debt bearing a floating interest rate, which are primarily subject to interest rate floors. Approximately 71 of the Company s debt portfolio at fair value had an interest rate floor denoted in SOFR or EURIBOR. The weighted average interest rate floor across the Company s floating-rate portfolio was approximately 0.7 as of September 30, 2024. These floors allow the Company to mitigate (to a degree) any impact of spread widening on the valuation of the Company s investments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s estimated weighted average total yield of investments in debt securities was 11.2 . Weighted average yields are based on interest rates as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had investments, excluding cash equivalents, in 25 portfolio companies across 13 industries. Based on fair value as of December 31, 2023, 76 of the Company s debt portfolio was invested in debt bearing a floating interest rate, which are primarily subject to interest rate floors. Approximately 76 of the Company s debt portfolio at fair value had an interest rate floor denoted in SOFR. The weighted average interest rate floor across the Company s floating-rate portfolio was approximately 0.7 as of December 31, 2023. These floors allow the Company to mitigate (to a degree) any impact of spread widening on the valuation of the Company s investments. As of December 31, 2023, the Company s estimated weighted average total yield of investments in debt securities was 11.9 . Weighted average yields are based on interest rates as of December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

As part of the monitoring process, the Advisor has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments. The Advisor has developed a classification system to group investments into four categories. The investments are evaluated regularly and assigned a category based on certain credit metrics. The Advisor s ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. Please see below for a description of the four categories of the Advisor s Internal Risk Rating system: Category 1 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 1 involve the least amount of risk relative to the Company s initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Category 1 investments performance is above the Company s initial underwriting expectations and the business trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company, or the likelihood of a potential exit. Category 2 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 2 involve a level of risk relative to the Company s initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Category 2 investments are generally performing in line with the Company s initial underwriting expectations and risk factors to ultimately recoup the cost of our principal investment are neutral to favorable. All new originated or acquired investments are initially included in Category 2. Category 3 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 3 indicate that the risk to the Company s ability to recoup the initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition has increased materially since the origination or acquisition of the investment, such as declining financial performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, principal and interest payments are not more than 120 days past due. Category 4 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 4 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicate that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For Category 4 investments, it is anticipated that the Company will not recoup the Company s initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of the Company s initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition upon exit. The distribution of the Company s portfolio, including cash equivalents, on the Advisor s Internal Risk Rating System is as follows:

For the three month periods and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total investment income was driven by the Company s deployment of capital and invested balance of investments. The size of the Company s investment portfolio at fair value was approximately 200 million as of September 30, 2024 and, as of such date, all of the Company s debt investments were income producing. Interest income on the Company s debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, the Company expects the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement.

Other expenses include valuation, insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. Organization and offering costs include expenses incurred in the Company s initial formation and the Company s offering of Shares. Waivers include organizational costs and management fee waivers. Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes The Company has elected, as of August 1, 2022, to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and the Company intends to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, distribute to the Company s stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our Investment Company Taxable Income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain the Company s tax treatment as a RIC, the Company, among other things, intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which generally relieve the Company from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. For the three month periods and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not incur any excise tax. Financial Condition, Liquidity And Capital Resources The Company generates cash from the net proceeds of offerings of its Shares, and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from its investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of its investments. The Company may also fund a portion of its investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before the Company has fully invested the proceeds of any closing of the Company s continuous private offering of its Shares. The Company s primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of Company expenses and payment of cash distributions to stockholders. Financing Transactions The Company intends to utilize leverage (including through the establishment of wholly-owned financing subsidiaries) to finance its investments and operations. The amount of leverage that the Company employs will be subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act and the supervision of the Board. At the time of any proposed borrowing, the amount of leverage the Company employs will also depend on the Advisor s assessment of market and other factors. The Company may use leverage for investments, working capital, expenses and general corporate purposes (including to pay dividends or distributions).

Table of Contents 

The Company is subject to limitations on leverage applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, the Company is only permitted to borrow amounts such that the Company s asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after (and including) such borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, our average asset coverage ratio was 1,813.83 . In determining whether to borrow money or issue debt on behalf of the Company, the Advisor will analyze, as applicable, the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to the Company s investment outlook, among other factors. Any such leverage, if incurred, would increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. On June 19, 2023, the Company, entered into the Credit Facility with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company under which the Company is permitted to borrow up to 150,000 (amount in thousands). On June 10, 2024, the maximum aggregate committed borrowing amount was reduced to 100,000 (amount in thousands). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 13,640 (amount in thousands) of outstanding borrowings. See Note 4. Borrowings in Item 1. Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for more information. The Company may also from time to time enter into new credit facilities, increase the size of existing credit facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. Contractual Obligations The Company has entered into an Advisory Agreement with the Advisor pursuant to the 1940 Act to provide the Company with investment advisory services and the Administration Agreement with the Administrator to provide the Company with administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Advisory Agreement are described under Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Related Party Transactions . Payments for administration services under the Administration Agreement are described under Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Related Party Transactions . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of its portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believed it had adequate resources to satisfy its unfunded commitments. The unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies were as follows (amount in thousands): 

Unfunded Commitments

 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities For the three month periods and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not hold closings of our continuous private offering of Shares. Distributions and Distribution Reinvestment For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the Board declared the following distributions: On May 22, 2024, the Company paid a dividend of 0.14 per share to stockholders of record as of May 20, 2024. On August 22, 2024, the Company paid a dividend of 0.29 per share to stockholders of record as of August 20, 2024.

Table of Contents 

The Company has adopted an opt out DRIP. As a result, unless stockholders elect to opt out of the DRIP, stockholders will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Common Stock ), rather than receiving cash. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of Common Stock will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, those stockholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the Company s financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Fair Value of Investments, Revenue Recognition, Deferred Financing Fees, Distribution Policy, and Income Taxes. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and practices. The Company s critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of its investment portfolio, should be read in connection with the Company s financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Report, and Risk Factors in Item 1A of the Company s initial registration statement on Form 10 Form 10 and most recent Form 10-K. Related Party Transactions The Company has entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following (which are defined in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements if not defined herein): 

the Advisory Agreement; 

the Administration Agreement; and 

the Expense Reimbursement Agreement. See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements-Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3. Related Party Transactions. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. To the extent that the Company borrows money to make investments, the Company s net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which the Company borrows funds and the rate at which the Company invests these funds. In periods of rising interest rates, the Company s cost of funds would increase, which may reduce the Company s net investment income. Because the Company expects that most of its investments will bear interest at floating rates, the Company anticipates that an increase in interest rates would have a corresponding increase in the Company s interest income that would likely offset any increase in the Company s cost of funds and, thus, net investment income would not be reduced. However, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have an adverse effect on the Company s net investment income. The Company will generally invest in illiquid loans and securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Because the Company expects that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in the Company s portfolio, the Company expects to value many of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Advisor using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, subject to Board oversight. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.

Assuming that the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, were to remain constant and that the Company took no actions to alter its existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (amounts in thousands).

 In addition, although the Company does not currently intend to make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent it does, the Company will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. The Company may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate the Company against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit the Company s ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the Company s portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s President and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Company s President and Treasurer have concluded that the Company s current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to the Company s knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company. From time to time, the Company may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of the Company s rights under loans to or other contracts with the Company s portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Form 10-K, which could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in the Company s Form 10-K are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in the Company s most recent Form 10-K.
