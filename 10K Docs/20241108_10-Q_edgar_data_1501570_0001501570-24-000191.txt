 Cost Method Accounting 
 
 The Company follows ASC 325-20, Cost Method Investments, to account for its ownership interest in noncontrolled entities. Under ASC 325-20, equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values (i.e., non-marketable equity securities) and are not required to be accounted for under the equity method are typically carried at cost (i.e., cost method investments). Investments of this nature are initially recorded at cost. Income is recorded for dividends received that are distributed from net accumulated earnings of the noncontrolled entity subsequent to the date of investment. Dividends received in excess of earnings subsequent to the date of investment are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions in the cost of the investment. Investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred.

 MBS are commercial MBS, secured by commercial properties, and residential MBS, generally secured by single-family residential properties. All MBS included in the table above were issued by U.S. government agencies or corporations. 
 The Company did t transfer any debt securities from AFS to HTM during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company elected to transfer AFS debt securities with an aggregate fair value of to a classification of HTM debt securities on January 1, 2022. In accordance with FASB ASC 320-10-35-10, the transfer from AFS to HTM was recorded at the fair value of the AFS debt securities at the time of transfer. The net unrealized holding gain retained in AOCI for securities transferred from AFS to HTM was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Management evaluates AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. 
 The number of AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management does not have the intent to sell any of these debt securities and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such debt securities before a recovery of cost. The fair value is expected to recover as the debt securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that the unrealized losses detailed in the previous table are due to noncredit-related factors, including changes in interest rates and other market conditions, and therefore no losses have been recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of income.

 The majority of the Company's loan portfolio consists of loans to businesses and individuals in the DFW metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area. This geographic concentration subjects the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within these areas. The risks created by this concentration have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the ACL. 
 A loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.

 Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans 
 Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement . Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

 Loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest are considered well-secured and in the process of collection as of the reporting date with plans in place for the borrowers to bring the notes fully current. The Company believes that it will collect all principal and interest due on each of the loans 90 days past due and still accruing. 
 Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 The Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, effective January 1, 2023. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminated the recognition and measure of troubled debt restructurings and enhanced disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 
 An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the ACL (due to the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance), a change to the ACL is generally not recorded upon modification.

 NOOCRE Commercial Total 
 The Company has not committed to lend additional amounts to customers with outstanding loans classified as Troubled Loan Modifications as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 From a credit risk standpoint, the Company classifies its loans in one of the following categories: (i) pass, (ii) special mention, (iii) substandard or (iv) doubtful. Loans classified as loss are charged-off. Loans not rated special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss are classified as pass loans. 
 The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. The Company reviews the ratings on criticized credits monthly. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is felt to be inherent in each credit as of each monthly reporting period. All classified credits are evaluated for impairment. If impairment is determined to exist, a specific reserve is established. The Company s methodology is structured so that specific reserves are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss). 
 Credits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in credit worthiness, however, such concerns are generally not so pronounced that the Company expects to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform within standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits with a lower rating. 
 Credits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse trends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses which exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these credits is a distinct possibility. PCA is therefore required to strengthen the Company s position, and/or to reduce exposure and to assure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the secondary support to the credit is performed.

MW commitments Standby and commercial letters of credit Total 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Management evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis and substantially all of the Company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of future loan funding. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. 
 MW commitments are unconditionally cancellable and represent the unused capacity on MW facilities the Company has approved. The Company reserves the right to refuse to buy any mortgage loans offered for sale by a customer, for any reason, at the Company s sole and absolute discretion. 
 Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby and commercial letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company s policy for obtaining collateral and the nature of such collateral is substantially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report as well as with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except where the content otherwise requires or when otherwise indicated, the terms Veritex, the Company, we, us, our, and our business refer to the combined entities of Veritex Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Veritex Community Bank. 
 
 This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable but may prove to be inaccurate. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth under Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, may cause actual results to differ materially from the projected results discussed in the forward-looking statements appearing in this discussion and analysis. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. For additional information concerning forward-looking statements, please read Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a Texas state banking organization with corporate offices in Dallas, Texas. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Veritex Community Bank, a Texas state-chartered bank, we provide relationship-driven commercial banking products and services tailored to meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses and professionals. Beginning at our operational inception in 2010, we initially targeted customers and focused our acquisitions primarily in the Dallas metropolitan area, which we consider to be Dallas and the adjacent communities in North Dallas. Our current primary markets includes the broader DFW metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area. As we continue to grow, we may expand to other metropolitan banking markets in Texas. 
 
 Our business is conducted through one reportable segment, community banking, which generates the majority of our revenues from interest income on loans, customer service and loan fees, gains on sale of government guaranteed loans and mortgage loans and interest income from securities. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expense, such as salaries, employee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest earning assets and expense of our liabilities through net interest margin. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. 
 
 Changes in the market interest rates and interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, and interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Texas and, specifically, in the DFW metroplex and Houston metropolitan area, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors within our target markets and throughout the state of Texas. 

In accordance with Item 303(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K, the Company is providing a comparison of the quarter ended September 30, 2024 against the preceding sequential quarter. The Company has elected to provide this comparison because it believes providing a sequential discussion of its results of operations provides more relevant information for investors and stakeholders to understand and analyze the business. The Company continues to present the required comparison of current year-to-date results with the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Financial information for the three months ended June 30, 2024, may be found in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2 of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 
 General 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 31.0 million, an increase of 3.8 million, or 14.0 , from net income of 27.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Basic EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.57, an increase of 0.07 from 0.50 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.56, an increase of 0.06 from 0.50 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled 100.1 million and net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.30 and 2.03 , respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, net interest income totaled 96.2 million and net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.29 and 2.04 , respectively. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 4.8 million on d eposits in financial institutions and Fed Funds sold , a 422 thousand increase in interest income on debt securities and a 1.4 million decrease in interest expense on advances from FHLB. The increase was partially offset by a 1.6 million increase in interest expense on transaction and savings deposits and a 1.4 million increase in interest expense on certificates and other time deposits during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Net interest margin increased 1 bps to 3.30 from 3.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in yields on MW loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased to 4.44 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.46 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense totaled 96.6 million and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 4.46 . For the three months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense totaled 95.0 million and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 4.50 . The quarter-over-quarter decrease rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to decrease in the average rates paid on subordinated debentures and subordinated debt. 
 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, an analysis of net interest income by each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amounts outstanding and the interest earned or paid on such amounts. The table also sets forth the average rates earned on interest-earning assets, the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods. Interest earned on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is not recognized in income; however, the balances are reflected in average outstanding balances for the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three months ended June 30, 2024, interest income not recognized on nonaccrual loans was 638 thousand and 763 thousand, respectively. Any nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. June 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) Due to Change in Volume Rate Total (In thousands) Interest-earning assets: Loans (2,743) 1,583 (1,160) LHI, MW 893 549 1,442 Debt Securities 370 52 422 Equity securities and other investments 5,002 (153) 4,849 Interest-bearing deposits in other banks (44) (93) (137) Total increase in interest income 3,478 1,938 5,416 Interest-bearing liabilities: Interest-bearing demand and savings deposits 1,293 296 1,589 Certificates and other time deposits 1,091 328 1,419 Advances from FHLB (1,419) (2) (1,421) Subordinated debentures and subordinated notes 3 3 Total increase in interest expense 968 622 1,590 Increase in net interest income 2,510 1,316 3,826 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Our provision for credit losses is a charge to income in order to bring our ACL to a level deemed appropriate by management. We recorded a provision for credit losses of 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.3 million provision for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The change was primarily attributable to a decrease in loan production and changes in economic factors. We reco rded no benefit or provision for unfunded commitments, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended June 30, 2024, as the balance of unfunded commitments remained relatively flat quarter over quarter.

Noninterest Income 
 Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are service charges and fees on deposit accounts, loan fees, loss on sales of debt securities, government guaranteed loan income, net, customer swap income, and other income. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees, which are generally recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest income: For the Three Months Ended September 30, June 30, Increase 2024 2024 (Decrease) (In thousands) Noninterest income: Service charges and fees on deposit accounts 5,442 4,974 468 Loan fees 3,278 2,207 1,071 Government guaranteed loan income, net 780 1,320 (540) Customer swap income 271 326 (55) Other 3,335 1,751 1,584 Total noninterest income 13,106 10,578 2,528 
 Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.5 million, or 23.9 , to 13.1 million compared to noninterest income of 10.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The primary drivers of the increase were as follows 
 Loan fees. Certain loan fees are earned in connection with funding and servicing loans. The increase in loan fees of 1.1 million, or 48.5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 were primarily due to an increase of 555 thousand in syndication fees and an increase of 449 thousand in loan fee income. 
 Other. Other includes other noninterest income from fees. Other noninterest income was 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.6 million, or 90.5 , as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in OREO income of 1.2 million. The remaining changes were nominal amongst individual other noninterest income accounts.

Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, acquiring and retaining customer relationships and providing bank services. The major component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits. Noninterest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy and equipment expenses, professional fees and regulatory fees, data processing and software expenses, marketing expenses, amortization of intangibles, telephone and communications expenses and other expenses. 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest expense: For the Three Months Ended September 30, June 30, Increase 2024 2024 (Decrease) (In thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 37,370 32,790 4,580 Occupancy and equipment 4,789 4,585 204 Professional and regulatory fees 4,903 5,617 (714) Data processing and software expense 5,268 5,097 171 Marketing 2,781 1,976 805 Amortization of intangibles 2,438 2,438 Telephone and communications 335 365 (30) Other 12,216 10,273 1,943 Total noninterest expense 70,100 63,141 6,959

 Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits include payroll expense, the cost of incentive compensation, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes. These expenses are impacted by the amount of direct loan origination costs, which are required to be deferred in accordance with ASC 310-20. Salaries and employee benefits were 37.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.6 million , or 14.0 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a 1.7 million increase in general bonuses, an increase of 985 thousand in salaries, 707 thousand increase in severance costs and a 638 thousand increase in lender incentives. The remaining changes were nominal amongst individual other salaries and employee benefits expense accounts.

Other noninterest expense was 12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 , an increase of 1.9 million , or 18.9 . This increase was primarily due to an increase of 1.1 million in OREO expenses and an increase of 972 thousand in earned credit rebates . The remaining changes were nominal amongst individual other noninterest expense accounts 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 51 

Income tax expense is a function of our pre-tax income, tax-exempt income and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect current statutory income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2023, a 4.2 million valuation allowance was established relating to an impairment on our investment in Thrive. The valuation allowance decreased by 941 thousand as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , income tax expense totaled 8.1 million, a decrease of 154 thousand, compared to an income tax expense of 8.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we had an effective tax rate of 20.6 . The Company had a one-time tax expense for return to provision of 224 thousand and a 941 thousand benefit related to the release of the change in the Company s valuation allowance during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had a net discrete tax expense of 91 thousand associated with the recognition of an excess tax expense realized on share-based payment awards during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding these discrete tax items, the Company had an effective tax rate of 22.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For the three months ended June 30, 2024 , income tax expense totaled 8.2 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 , we had an effective tax rate of 23.2 . The increase was primarily due to a one-time tax expense of 527 thousand. The Company also had a net discrete tax expense of 26 thousand associated with the recognition of an excess tax expense realized on share-based payment awards made during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Excluding this discrete tax item, the Company had an effective tax rate of 23.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 General 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 82.4 million, a decrease of 22.3 million, or 21.3 , from net income of 104.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Basic EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.51, a decrease of 0.42 from 1.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.50, a decrease of 0.42 from 1.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income before provisions for credit losses totaled 289.1 million and net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.28 and 2.01 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net interest income before provision for credit losses totaled 303.6 million and net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.55 and 2.51 , respectively. Net interest margin decrease d 27 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in net interest income of 14.5 million was primarily attributable to an increase of 46.3 million in interest expense on certificates and other time deposits and a 36.9 million increase in interest expense on transaction accounts. The increase was partially offset by a 35.5 million decrease in interest expense on advances from FHLB, an increase in interest income on loans of 13.4 million due to an increase in loan yields and higher average balances , a 12.9 million increase in interest income on debt securities and a 8.2 million increase in interest income on deposits in financial institutions and fed funds sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 83.2 million increase in interest expense on deposit accounts was due to an increase in average funding costs of total deposits. As a result, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 82 bps to 4.44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average costs of total deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 140 bps to 3.43 compared to 2.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense totaled 283.4 million and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 4.48 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense totaled 235.7 million and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 3.80 . The increase of 47.8 million in interest expense was primarily due increases in the average rates paid on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, certificates and other time deposits driven by the impact of rising interest rates year over year.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, an analysis of net interest income by each major category of interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the average amounts outstanding and the interest earned or paid on such amounts. The table also sets forth the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods. Interest earned on loans that are classified as non-accrual is not recognized in income; however, the balances are reflected in average outstanding balances for the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, interest income not recognized on non-accrual loans was 2.2 million and 4.7 million, respectively. Any non-accrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

The following table presents the changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated for each major component of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and distinguishes between the changes attributable to changes in volume and interest rates. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated to rate. 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs September 30, 2023 Increase (Decrease) Due to Change in Volume Rate Total (In thousands) Interest-earning assets: Loans 1,960 8,010 9,970 LHI, MW 1,291 2,119 3,410 Debt securities 4,817 8,034 12,851 Interest-bearing deposits in other banks 6,297 1,877 8,174 Equity securities and other investments (1,774) 596 (1,178) Total increase in interest income 12,591 20,636 33,227 Interest-bearing liabilities: Interest-bearing demand and savings deposits 14,054 22,807 36,861 Certificates and other time deposits 19,154 27,135 46,289 Advances from FHLB (36,040) 503 (35,537) Subordinated debentures and subordinated notes 9 82 91 Total (decrease) increase in interest expense (2,823) 50,527 47,704 Increase (decrease) in net interest income 15,414 (29,891) (14,477) 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Our provision for credit losses is a charge to income in order to bring our ACL to a level deemed appropriate by management. For a description of the factors taken into account by management in determining the ACL see Financial Condition ACL on LHI . The provision for credit loan losses was 19.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 33.0 million provision for credit loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 13.3 million. The decrease in the recorded provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to changes in economic factors, qualitative factors and specific reserves on loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also recorded a 1.5 million benefit for unfunded commitments compared to a 541 thousand benefit for unfunded commitments for nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Noninterest Income 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest income: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (In thousands) Noninterest income: Service charges and fees on deposit accounts 15,312 15,448 (136) Loan fees 7,995 5,148 2,847 Loss on sales of debt securities (6,304) (5,321) (983) Government guaranteed loan income, net 4,714 15,604 (10,890) Equity method investment loss (1,172) 1,172 Customer swap income 1,046 1,380 (334) Other 7,583 5,810 1,773 Total noninterest income 30,346 36,897 (6,551) 
 
 Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6.6 million, or 17.8 , to 30.3 million compared to noninterest income of 36.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the decrease were as follows: 
 Loan fees. The increase in loan fees of 2.8 million is primarily due to an increase of 1.2 million of syndication and related fees, a 562 thousand increase in late charges on CRE loans, a 307 thousand increase in letter of credit fees, a 296 thousand increase in unused lines consumer fees, a 209 thousand increase in warehouse C I file fees and a 202 thousand increase in loan fee income. 
 Loss on sales of debt securities. The decrease in the loss on sale of debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to a 6.3 million loss on sales of debt securities due to as a result of a strategic restructuring in which we sold 120.1 million of lower-yielding AFS debt securities, at amortized cost, with a 3.11 average yield during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 5.3 million loss on sales of debt securities due to the Company selling 116.2 million of debt securities in March 2023. 
 Government guaranteed loan income, net. Government guaranteed loan income, net, includes income related to the sales of SBA and USDA loans. The decrease in government guaranteed loan income, net, of 10.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 9.8 million decrease in the gain on sale of USDA loans and a decrease of 3.5 million in government guaranteed LHFS loan valuation, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 2.3 million in the gain on sale of SBA loans. 
 Equity method investment loss. Equity method investment loss is comprised of losses and gains primarily related to our previous investment in Thrive. The change in equity method investment loss is related to the Company divesting of our equity method investment in Thrive related to Thrive s entry into a definitive agreement in December 2023 to be acquired by Lower, which acquisition closed in March of 2024. Our subsequent investment in Lower is accounted for under cost method accounting. 
 Other. Other includes other noninterest income from fees. Other noninterest income was 7.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.8 million, or 30.5 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase of 1.2 million in OREO income. The remaining changes were nominal amongst individual other noninterest income accounts.

Financial Condition 
 
 Our total assets increased 648.6 million , or 5.2 , from 12.39 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 13.04 billion as of September 30, 2024. Our asset growth was due to the continued execution of our strategy to establish deep relationships in the DFW metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area. We believe these relationships will continue to bring in new customer accounts and grow balances from existing loan and deposit customers. 
 
 Loan Portfolio 
 
 Our primary source of income is interest on loans to individuals, professionals, small to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies primarily located in the DFW metroplex and Houston metropolitan area. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans and real estate loans secured by CRE properties located in our primary market areas. Our loan portfolio represents the highest yielding component of our interest-earning asset base. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, total LHI, excluding ACL, was 9.67 billion, an increase of 74.3 million, or 0.8 , compared to 9.59 billion as of December 31, 2023.

 ACL on LHI 
 We maintain an ACL that represents management s best estimate of the credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. In determining the ACL, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the ACL is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates.

The following table presents, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the ACL and other related data:

 The ACL increased 7.3 million to 117.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to changes in economic factors resulting in increases in both general and qualitative factor reserves.

 Net charge-offs decreased 1.8 million, or 3 bps, to average loans annualized. Although we believe that we have established our ACL in accordance with GAAP and that the ACL was adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times shown above, future provisions will be subject to ongoing evaluations of the risks in our loan portfolio. If we experience economic declines or if asset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required. 
 OBS Credit exposure 
 The ACL on OBS credit exposures totaled 6.5 million and 8.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The level of the ACL on OBS credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding commitments, underlying risk grades, the expected utilization of available funds and forecasted economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio. 
 Equity Securities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held equity securities with a readily determinable fair value of 10.1 million compared to 9.9 million as of December 31, 2023. These equity securities primarily represent investments in a publicly traded CRA fund and are subject to market pricing volatility, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. 
 
 The Company held equity securities without a readily determinable fair values and measured at cost of 48.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.6 million at December 31, 2023. The Company measures equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. 

64 

FHLB Stock and FRB Stock 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held FHLB stock and FRB stock of 47.9 million compared to 53.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The Bank is a member of its regional FRB and of the FHLB system. FHLB members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. Both FRB and FHLB stock are carried at cost, restricted for sale, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. 
 
 Debt Securities 
 We use our debt securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, provide an appropriate return on funds invested, manage interest rate risk, meet collateral requirements and meet regulatory capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of debt securities totaled 1.42 billion, an increase of 166.6 million, or 13.3 , compared to 1.26 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due purchases of AFS debt securities of 638.2 million. The increase was partially offset by the sale of debt securities of 113.8 million at a loss of 6.3 million, an unrealized loss of 30.1 million and 382.6.0 million in paydowns. Debt securities represented 10.9 and 10.1 of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 All of our MBS and CMOs are issued and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored entities. We do not hold any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, corporate equity, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles, private label CMOs, subprime, Alt-A, or second lien elements in our investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio did not contain any securities that are directly backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages. 
 
 Management evaluates AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The Company has 122 AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position totaling 70.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company evaluated all debt securities and no ACL on debt securities was recognized in the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. The Company recorded no ACL for its held to maturity debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not own securities of any one issuer other than U.S. government agency securities for which aggregate cost exceeded 10.0 of our stockholders equity as of such respective dates 
 Deposits 
 
 Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 were 11.04 billion, an increase of 697.8 million, or 6.7 , compared to 10.34 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase from December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of increases of 434.2 million in certificates and other time deposits, 425.9 million in noninterest-bearing transactions. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 143.7 million in interest-bearing demand deposits and a decrease of 18.5 million in correspondent money market deposits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity management involves our ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our liquidity needs were primarily met by core deposits, wholesale borrowings, security and loan maturities and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Use of brokered deposits, purchased funds from correspondent banks and overnight advances from the FHLB and the FRB are available and have been utilized to take advantage of the cost of these funding sources. 
 We maintained five lines of credit with commercial banks that provide for extensions of credit with an availability to borrow up to an aggregate of 150.0 million as of September 30, 2024. We maintained five lines of credit with commercial banks that provide for extensions of credit with an availability to borrow up to an aggregate of 125.0 million as of December 31, 2023. There were no advances under these lines of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The following table illustrates, during the periods presented, the mix of our funding sources and the average assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of our average total assets for the period indicated. Average assets totaled 12.59 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 12.28 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Our primary source of funds is deposits and our primary use of funds is loans. We do not expect a change in the primary source or use of our funds in the foreseeable future and believe that funds provided by such means will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and foreseeable future. Our average LHI increased 0.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. We used excess deposits to pay down FHLB borrowings to reduce wholesale funding. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.82 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit, 487.4 million in unconditionally cancellable MW commitments and 113.8 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, we had 3.08 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit, 803.7 million in MW commitments and 111.6 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.10 billion compared to 629.1 million as of December 31, 2023.

Analysis of Cash Flows 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 143,009 138,068 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (234,337) 74,898 Net cash provided by financing activities 563,055 64,365 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 471,727 277,331 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities increased by 4.9 million when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from sales of LHFS. 
 Net Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash (used in) provided by investing activities increased by 309.2 million when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a 198.5 million increase in purchases of AFS debt securities and a 52.0 million decrease in proceeds from sale of government guaranteed loans. This was partially offset by a 117.3 million decrease in net loans originated and a 36.1 million decrease in purchases of other investments. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities increased by 498.7 million when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in deposits slightly offset by a lower balance of FHLB advances as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature. 
 Share Repurchases

Capital Resources 
 Total stockholders equity increased to 1.61 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.53 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 76.7 million, or 5.0 . The increase from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of 82.4 million of net income recognized, 23.1 million in AOCI and 9.3 million in stock-based compensation. This increase was partially offset by 32.7 million in dividends declared and paid, 3.5 million in stock buybacks and 2.2 million of RSUs vesting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 By comparison, total stockholders equity increased to 1.49 billion as of September 30, 2023, compared to 1.45 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 41.4 million, or 2.9 . The increase from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of 104.8 million of net income recognized, 9.0 million in stock-based compensation and a 803 thousand increase due to the exercise of employee stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This increase was partially offset by 32.5 million in dividends declared and paid, 38.4 million in other comprehensive income and 2.2 million of RSUs vesting during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Capital management consists of providing equity to support our current and future operations. Our regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. We are subject to regulatory capital requirements at the bank holding company and bank levels. See Note 12 Capital Requirements and Restrictions on Retained Earnings in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us and the Bank. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, w e and the Bank were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank was classified as well capitalized for purposes of the PCA regulations. As we employ our capital and continue to grow our operations, our regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings. However, we expect to monitor and control our growth in order to remain in compliance with all regulatory capital standards applicable to us. 
 The following table presents the actual capital amounts and regulatory capital ratios for us and the Bank as of the dates indicated.

 Contractual Obligations 
 In the ordinary course of the Company s operations, we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Other than normal changes in the ordinary course of business and changes discussed within Financial Condition Borrowings, there have been no significant changes in the types of contractual obligations or amounts due as of September 30, 2024 since December 31, 2023 as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the financial services industry. However, we also evaluate our performance by reference to certain additional financial measures discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that we identify as being non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Tangible Book Value Per Common Share . Tangible book value is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders equity less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization; and (b) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by number of common shares outstanding. For tangible book value per common share, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value per common share. 
 We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in core deposit intangibles. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value. 
 
 The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders equity to tangible common equity and presents our tangible book value per common share compared with our book value per common share: 
 As of Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Tangible Common Equity Total stockholders' equity 1,608,014 1,491,166 Adjustments: Goodwill (404,452) (404,452) Core deposit intangibles (21,182) (30,933) Tangible common equity 1,182,380 1,055,781 Common shares outstanding 54,446 54,305 Book value per common share 29.53 27.46 Tangible book value per common share 21.72 19.44 
 
 Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets . Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders equity, less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible assets as total assets less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization; and (c) tangible common equity to tangible assets as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by tangible assets (as described in clause (b)). For tangible common equity to tangible assets, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is total stockholders equity to total assets. 
 
 We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the relative changes from period to period in common equity and total assets, in each case, exclusive of changes in core deposit intangibles. Goodwill and 
 71 

other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total stockholders equity and assets while not increasing our tangible common equity or tangible assets. 
 
 The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets and presents our tangible common equity to tangible assets: 
 As of Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Tangible Common Equity Total stockholders' equity 1,608,014 1,491,166 Adjustments: Goodwill (404,452) (404,452) Core deposit intangibles (21,182) (30,933) Tangible common equity 1,182,380 1,055,781 Tangible Assets Total assets 13,042,976 12,346,331 Adjustments: Goodwill (404,452) (404,452) Core deposit intangibles (21,182) (30,933) Tangible Assets 12,617,342 11,910,946 Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets 9.37 8.86 
 
 Return on Average Tangible Common Equity . Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) net income available for common stockholders adjusted for amortization of core deposit intangibles (which we refer to as return as net income, plus amortization of core deposit intangibles, less tax benefit at the statutory rate; (b) average tangible common equity as total average stockholders equity less average goodwill and average core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization; and (c) return (as described in clause (a)) divided by average tangible common equity (as described in clause (b)). For return on average tangible common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity. 
 
 We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the return on common equity, exclusive of the impact of core deposit intangibles. Goodwill and core deposit intangibles have the effect of increasing total stockholders equity while not increasing our tangible common equity. This measure is particularly relevant to acquisitive institutions that may have higher balances in goodwill and core deposit intangibles than non-acquisitive institutions. 
 
 The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, average tangible common equity to average common equity and net income available for common stockholders adjusted for amortization of core deposit intangibles, net of taxes to net income and presents our return on average tangible common equity:

 Operating Earnings. Operating earnings and the performance metrics calculated using these metrics, listed below, are non-GAAP measures used by management to evaluate the Company s financial performance. We calculate (a) operating earnings as net income plus severance payments, plus loss on sale of debt securities AFS, net, plus M A expenses less tax impact of adjustments, plus nonrecurring tax adjustments. We calculate (b) diluted operating EPS as operating earnings as described in clause (a) divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
 
 We believe that these measures and the operating metrics calculated utilizing these measures are important to management and many investors in the marketplace who are interested in understanding the ongoing operating performance of the Company and provide meaningful comparisons to its peers. 
 
 The following tables reconcile, as of the dates set forth below, operating earnings and related metrics:

 1 Severance payments relate to certain restructurings made during the periods disclosed. 

Pre-tax, Pre-provision Operating Earnings. Pre-provision operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings as operating earnings as described in clause (a), plus provision for income taxes and plus provision (benefit) for credit losses. 
 
 73 

We believe that these measures and the operating metrics calculated utilizing these measures are important to management and many investors in the marketplace who are interested in understanding the ongoing operating performance of the Company and provide meaningful comparisons to its peers. 
 
 The following tables reconcile, as of the dates set forth below, pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings and related metrics:

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. We have identified certain significant accounting policies which involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in making certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements relate to ACL, business combinations, debt securities and goodwill. Since December 31, 2023 , there have been no changes in critical accounting policies as described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , except for those updates discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset, liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We manage our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 We manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. With exception of our cash flow hedges designated as a hedging instrument, we do not enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives, interest rate swaps, financial options, financial future contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. We enter into interest rate swaps, caps and collars as an accommodation to our customers in connection with our interest rate swap program. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Asset-Liability Committee of the Bank in accordance with policies approved by its board of directors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model. 
 We use an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet, respectively. Contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio. 
 We utilize static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on net interest income of changes in interest 
 rates under various rate scenarios. This analysis estimates a percentage of change in the metric from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet. Internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 5.0 for a 100 bps shift, 10.0 for a 200 bps shift, and 15.0 for a 300 bps shift. 
 
 76 

The following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon as of the dates indicated: 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Percent Change Percent Change Percent Change Percent Change Change in Interest in Net Interest in Fair Value in Net Interest in Fair Value Rates (BPS) Income of Equity Income of Equity + 300 10.27 (6.24) 11.39 (6.15) + 200 6.98 (3.28) 7.70 (3.23) + 100 3.53 (1.18) 3.92 (1.05) Base 100 (2.94) (0.60) (4.16) (1.65) 200 (5.68) (3.54) (10.01) (6.48) 
 The results are primarily due to behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits during such rate fluctuations. We have found that, historically, interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and Federal Funds Rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 
 There were no significant changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims and litigation may include, among other things, allegations of violation of banking and other applicable regulations, competition law, labor laws and consumer protection laws, as well as claims or litigation relating to intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation. 
 
 At this time, in the opinion of management, the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved in our favor. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In evaluating an investment in our common stock, investors should consider carefully, among other things, the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. 
 There has been no material change in the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 On March 26, 2024, the Board authorized a stock buyback program (the Stock Buyback Program pursuant to which the Company is authorized to purchase up to 50.0 million shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. The Stock Buyback Program has an expiration date of March 31, 2025, and may be suspended, terminated, amended or modified by the Board at any time without prior notice at the Board s discretion. Repurchases under the Stock Buyback Program may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate. The Stock Buyback Program does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares of its common stock. Repurchases by the Company under the Stock Buyback Program will be subject to general market and economic conditions, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other considerations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock in the following amounts: 
 
 (a) (b) (c) (d) Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs Maximum number (or approximate dollar value) of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs Beginning balance 50,000,000 July 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 1,982 20.24 1,982 46,462,852 August 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024 46,462,852 September 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 46,462,852 Quarterly totals and remaining balance available to repurchase 177,670 20.24 177,670 46,462,852
