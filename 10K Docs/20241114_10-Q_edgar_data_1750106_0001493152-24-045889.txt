Equity Method Investment 

The Company accounts for equity investment in entities
with significant influence under equity-method accounting. Under this method, the Group s pro rata share of income (loss) from investment
is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Company s share of loss in an equity-method investee equals or exceeds its carrying value of the investment in that entity,
the equity method investment can be reduced below zero based on losses, if the Company either is liable for the obligations of the investee
or provides for losses in excess of the investment when imminent return to profitable operations by the investee appears to be assured.
Otherwise, the Company does not recognize its share of equity method losses exceeding its carrying amount of the investment. Equity-method
investment is reviewed for impairment by assessing if the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary.
In making this determination, factors are evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized. These include consideration
of the intent and ability of the Company to hold investment and the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, justifying
the carrying amount of the investment. Impairment losses are recognized in other expense when a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.

Properties under development

land, building and improvements based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price for purposes of this
allocation is inclusive of acquisition costs which typically include legal fees, title fees, property inspection and valuation fees, as
well as other closing costs.

residential properties for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the assets

Identify the contract with a customer. 

The Company has signed agreements with the builders
for developing the raw land to ready to build lots. The contract has agreed upon prices, timelines, and specifications for what is to
be provided. 

Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

Performance obligations of the Company include delivering
developed lots to the customer, which are required to meet certain specifications that are outlined in the contract. The customer inspects
all lots prior to accepting title to ensure all specifications are met. 

Determine the transaction price. 

The transaction price per lot is fixed and specified
in the contract. Any subsequent change orders or price changes are required to be approved by both parties. 

Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. 

Each lot or a group of lots is considered to be a
separate performance obligation, for which the specified price in the contract is allocated to. 

Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The builders do the inspections to make sure all conditions/requirements
are met before taking title of lots. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when title is transferred. The Company does not
have further performance obligations or continuing involvement once title is transferred. Revenue is recognized at a point in time. 

Rental Revenue 

The Company leases real estate properties to its tenants
under leases that are predominately classified as operating leases, in accordance with ASC 842, Leases ASC 842 ). Real estate
rental revenue is comprised of minimum base rent and revenue from the collection of lease termination fees. 

Rent from tenants is recorded in accordance with the
terms of each lease agreement on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Rental revenue recognition begins when the
tenant controls the space and continues through the term of the related lease. Generally, at the end of the lease term, the Company provides
the tenant with a one-year renewal option, including mostly the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, subject
to rent increases. 

The Company defers rental revenue related to lease
payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. These amounts are presented within deferred revenues and other payables
on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Rental revenue is subject to an evaluation for collectability
on several factors, including payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, historical operations and operating
trends of the property, and current economic conditions. If our evaluation of these factors indicates that it is not probable that we
will recover substantially all of the receivable, rental revenue is limited to the lesser of the rental revenue that would be recognized
on a straight-line basis (as applicable) or the lease payments that have been collected from the lessee. Differences between rental revenue
recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged to straight-line rent receivable or straight-line
rent liability, as applicable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not
recognize any deferred revenue and collected all rents due. 

Cost of Revenues 

Real Estate 

Cost of Real Estate Sale

land development business. Land acquisition costs are allocated to each lot based on the area method, the size of the lot comparing to
the total size of all lots in the project. Development costs and capitalized interest are allocated to lots sold based on the total expected
development and interest costs of the completed project and allocating a percentage of those costs based on the selling price of the sold
lot compared to the expected sales values of all lots in the project. 

If allocation of development costs and capitalized
interest based on the projection and relative expected sales value is impracticable, those costs could also be allocated based on area
method, the size of the lot comparing to the total size of all lots in the project. 

Cost of Rental Revenue

associated with management and leasing fees to our management company, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and other related administrative
costs. Utility expenses are paid directly by tenants.

Product Direct Sales

when product is delivered to its members. Revenue is recorded net of applicable taxes, allowances, refund or returns. The Company receives

If any member returns a product to the Company on
a timely basis, they may obtain a replacement product from the Company for such returned product. We do not have buyback program. However,
when the customer requests a return and management decides that the refund is necessary, we initiate the refund after deducting all the
benefits that a member has earned. The returns are deducted from our sales revenue on our financial statements. Allowances for product
and membership returns are provided at the time the sale is recorded. This accrual is based upon historical return rates for each country
and the relevant return pattern, which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to 12 months following the original
sale. Product and membership returns for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately and , respectively.

obligation is to provide its members the right to (a) purchase products from the Company, (b) access to certain back-office services,

The Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis
in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include, but are
not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse
action or assessment by a regulator. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment
test. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company estimates
the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach,
which utilizes comparable companies data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value,
an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. The Company s evaluation of goodwill completed during the year resulted in no impairment losses.

Revenue was 4,960,711 and 990,199
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue was 12,173,964 and 21,070,983 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in property sales from the Lakes at Black Oak Project in the first nine months
of 2024 contributed to lower revenue in this period. 

In late 2022 and early 2023, the
Company entered into three contracts with builders to sell multiple lots from its Lakes at Black Oak project. The sales contemplated by
these contracts were contingent on certain conditions which the parties to such contracts had to meet and were expected to generate approximately
 23 million of funds from operations, not including certain expenses that the Company was required to pay. The sale of 335 lots closed
in the first six months of 2023 generating approximately 18.1 million revenue. The sale of remaining lots closed on January 4, 2024 generating
approximately 5.0 million revenue. 

On November 13, 2023, the Company
entered into two contracts with builders to sell multiple lots from its Lakes at Black Oak and Alset Villa projects. The closing of these
transactions depends on the satisfaction of certain conditions. The sale of the first 70 lots closed on July 1, 2024 generating approximately
 3.8 million. The sale of the remaining 72 lots closed on October 10, 2024 generating approximately 3.9 million. 

The Company plans to continue
its near-term focus on lot sales to regional and national builders. Funds from such lot sales will substantially improve the Company s
liquidity, strengthen its financial position and meet is working capital requirements. 

Revenue from rental business was
 724,699 and 705,334 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue from rental business was 2,150,204
and 2,030,112 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company expects that the revenue from this business
will continue to increase as we acquire more rental houses and successfully rent them. 

In May
2023, the Company entered into lease agreement for one of its model houses located in Montgomery County, Texas. The revenue from the lease
was 6,300 and 18,900 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The revenue from the lease was 6,300 and
 10,500 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

In January
2024, the Company entered into lease agreement for another model house located in Montgomery County, Texas. The revenue from the lease
was 6,602 and 19,807 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

The Company operates its biohealth segment in the South Korean market through one of the subsidiaries of HWH International Inc.,
HWH World Inc HWH World ). HWH World operates based on a direct sale model of health supplements. HWH World recognized 0
and 0 in revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. HWH World recognized 0 and 12,786 in revenue
in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
revenue from our Digital Transformation Technology segment, in the amount of 0 and 28,094, for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively, was for the services rendered to customers. The Company began generating revenue from a project providing
AI chatbot services to Value Exchange Int l (Hong Kong) Limited, a related company of the Company and a subsidiary of VEII located
in Hong Kong, on a monthly basis in 2022. This service was terminated on June 30, 2023.

The category
described as Other includes corporate and financial services, food and beverage business, digital transformation technology,
and new venture businesses. Other includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments, primarily consisting
of unallocated corporate overhead costs, including administrative functions not allocated to the reportable segments from global functional
expenses. 

The financial
services, food and beverage businesses and new venture businesses are small and diversified, and accordingly they are not separately addressed
as one independent category. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the revenue from other businesses was 421,012 and
 278,545, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the revenue from other businesses was 1,176,260 and 802,741,
respectively, generated by Korean, Singaporean and Chinese caf shops and restaurants.

Cost of revenues increased from
 581,059 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,949,824 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of revenues decreased
from 13,008,833 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8,438,149 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is
a result of the decrease in sales in the Lakes at Black Oak project. Capitalized construction expenses, finance costs and land costs are
allocated to sales. We anticipate the total cost of revenues to increase as revenue increases. 

The gross margin increased from
 409,140 to 2,010,887 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The gross margin decreased from 8,062,150
to 3,735,815 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The decrease of gross margin was caused by the decrease
in sales in the Lakes at Black Oak Project.

The
increase of operating expenses in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was mostly caused by recording
impairment of goodwill and investment. 

Other Income (Expense) 

In the three
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had other income of 2,433,020 compared to other
expenses of 14,903,980 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company had other expenses of 6,994,516 compared to other
expenses of 28,060,334 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The loss on sale of
securities and loss on consolidation of subsidiary are the primary reason for the volatility in these two periods. Realized loss on security
investment was 679,204 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11,291,166 loss in the nine months ended September 30,
2023. Loss on consolidation of subsidiary was 0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 21,657,036 in the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Loss 

In the three months ended September
30, 2024 the Company had net income of 1,469,239 compared to net loss of 17,026,008 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. In
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net loss of 6,994,516 compared to net loss of 27,162,596 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our real estate assets have decreased
to 37,904,992 as of September 30, 2024 from 42,137,152 as of December 31, 2023. This decrease primarily reflects the sale of properties
in the Lakes at Black Oak project. 

Our cash has decreased from 26,921,727
as of December 31, 2023 to 16,679,183 as of September 30, 2024. Our liabilities decreased from 9,066,700 at December 31, 2023 to 5,390,173
at September 30, 2024. Our total assets have decreased to 98,788,837 as of September 30, 2024 from 126,314,028 as of December 31, 2023
 mainly due to decrease in cash held in Trust Account after shareholders of HWH International Inc.
redeemed their shares. 

On April
17, 2019, SeD Maryland Development LLC entered into a Development Loan Agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company M T
Bank in the principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the sum of 8,000,000, with a cumulative loan advance amount
of 18,500,000. The line of credit bore interest rate on LIBOR plus 375 basis points. SeD Maryland Development LLC was also provided with
a Letter of Credit L/C Facility in an aggregate amount of up to 900,000. The L/C commission is 1.5 per annum on the
face amount of the L/C. Other standard lender fees apply in the event the L/C is drawn down. The loan is a revolving line of credit. The
L/C Facility is not a revolving loan, and amounts advanced and repaid may not be re-borrowed. Repayment of the Loan Agreement is secured
by a 2,600,000 collateral fund and a Deed of Trust issued to the Lender on the property owned by SeD Maryland. On March 15, 2022, approximately
 2,300,000 was released from collateral, leaving approximately 300,000 as collateral for outstanding letters of credit. On
December 14, 2023 approximately 201,751 was released from collateral, leaving approximately 100,000 as collateral for outstanding letters
of credit.

The future
development timeline of Lakes at Black Oak will be based on multiple conditions, including the amount of funds which may be raised from
capital markets, the loans we may secure from third party financial institutions, and government reimbursements which may be received.
The development will be step by step and expenses will be contingent on the amount of funding we will receive. 

On
November 13, 2023, 150 CCM Black Oak Ltd. (the Seller ), a Texas Limited Partnership, entered into two Contracts for Purchase
and Sale and Escrow Instructions (each an Agreement, collectively, the Agreements with Century Land Holdings
of Texas, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the Buyer ). Pursuant to the terms of one of the aforementioned Agreements,
the Seller has agreed to sell approximately 142 single-family detached residential lots (the Section 4 Agreement comprising
a section of a residential community in the city of Magnolia, Texas known as the Lakes at Black Oak. The selling price of
these lots is anticipated to equal approximately 7.4 million. Pursuant to the other Agreement, the Seller has agreed to sell 63 single-family
detached residential lots (the Alset Villas Agreement in the city of Magnolia, Texas. In 2021, our subsidiary Alset EHome
Inc. acquired approximately 19.5 acres of partially developed land near Houston, Texas which was used to develop a community named Alset
Villas Alset Villas ). Alset EHome was in the process of developing the 63 lots at Alset Villas in 2023. The selling price
of these lots is anticipated to equal approximately 3.3 million. The closing of the transactions described above depends on the satisfaction
of certain conditions. The sale of the first 70 lots closed on July 1, 2024 generating approximately 3.8 million. In addition, the Company
will be entitled to receive certain reimbursements in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2025. 

The management believes that the
available cash in bank accounts and favorable cash revenue from real estate projects are sufficient to fund our operations for at least
the next 12 months.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities
was 8,751,416 in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 8,255,675 in the same period
of 2023. Property sales from the Black Oak project in 2023 were the main reason for the cash provided by operating activities in 2023. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Net cash provided by investing
activities was 18,707,934 in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of 748,188 in the same
period of 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 1,368,083 in loans to related parties and 1,212,021
in loans receivable. At the same time, we received 101,096 from repayment of related party loan and withdrew cash from trust account
of 21,102,871 for redemption of HWH s shares. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we invested 734,688 in real estate improvements,
issued 1,693,455 in loans to related parties and received 2,675,735 from repayment of related party notes receivable. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities
was 21,370,610 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided of 3,408,560 in the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 is caused by repayment of 398,000 of note payable and
repayment of HWH s shares of 21,102,871. In that same period, the Company borrowed 130,261 from commercial loan. The cash provided
by financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 is caused by the proceeds from stock issuance of 3,433,921. 

11 

Impact of Inflation 

We believe that inflation has
not had a material impact on our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023.
We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 

Impact of Foreign Exchange Rates 

The effect of foreign exchange
rate changes on the intercompany loans (under ASC 830), which mostly consist of loans from Singapore to the United States and which were
approximately 26 million and 23 million on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are the reason for the significant
fluctuation of foreign currency transaction Gain or Loss on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive
Loss. Because the intercompany loan balances between Singapore and United States will remain at approximately 26 million over the next
year, we expect this fluctuation of foreign exchange rates to still significantly impact the results of operations in 2024, especially
given that the foreign exchange rate may and is expected to be volatile. If the amount of intercompany loan is lowered in the future,
the effect will be reduced. However, at this moment, we do not expect to repay the intercompany loans in the short term. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

We are an emerging growth
company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are
applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an
 emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of
these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. 

Seasonality 

The real estate business is subject
to seasonal shifts in costs as certain work is more likely to be performed at certain times of the year. This may impact the expenses
of our subsidiary Alset EHome Inc. from time to time. In addition, should we commence building homes, we are likely to experience periodic
spikes in sales as we commence the sales process at a particular location. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk

company as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this
