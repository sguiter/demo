 ownership interest in the Operating LP as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023 (see Note 2(a)). The general partner of the Partnership is NADG NNN Property Fund GP, LLLP (the General Partner ). The limited partners of the Partnership are U.S. investors (collectively, the U.S. LP who invest directly in the Partnership and NADG NNN Property Fund (Canadian) Limited Partnership (the CDN LP ), a Canadian partnership set up to admit Canadian investors, (the U.S. LP and the CDN LP, collectively the Common Unit Holders ), which invests in the Partnership through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NADG NNN Property Fund (US) Limited Partnership (see Note 7). NADG (US), LLLP is the sponsor of the Partnership (the Sponsor ). The General Partner undertook to ensure that the Sponsor or its affiliates would subscribe for common units in the Partnership Common Units representing at least of the total committed capital up to a maximum of . As of December 31, 2016, an affiliate of the Sponsor had subscribed for and been issued Common Units, on the same terms as other limited partners, and had contributed to the Partnership representing its full commitment to the Partnership. A director of such affiliate of the Sponsor is also a director of the Sponsor and the General Partner. Excess available cash (as determined by the General Partner) from net sales proceeds, net financing and refinancing proceeds, net rental income and all other revenues of the Partnership, will be distributed in accordance with the provisions and priorities set out in the limited partnership agreements, including any distributable cash payable to the General Partner.

 ownership interest in the Joint Venture. On August 18, 2023, the Partnership entered into an Interest Purchase Agreement with the JV Partner to acquire the remaining ownership interest in the Joint Venture. This acquisition closed on October 20, 2023 (see Note 5). Post-acquisition, the Partnership accounts for its ownership in the Joint Venture through consolidation (see Note 2 (a)). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Partnership had a ownership interest in the Joint Venture. The Partnership had evaluated the investment in the Joint Venture under ASC 810 and concluded that the Joint Venture is a VIE, however, the Partnership is not the primary beneficiary. The Partnership accounted for its non-controlling partnership interest in an unconsolidated joint venture using the equity method of accounting, as the Partnership exercised significant influence, but did not control this entity. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Partnership was reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and the Partnership s share of net income or loss from this joint venture was included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Partnership classifies distributions received from its investment in an unconsolidated entity based on the nature of distribution method . Under this approach, distributions are classified on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as either cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities depending on the nature of activities that generated the distribution. On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Partnership s investment in an unconsolidated joint venture may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. The estimated fair value of the investment is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is a Level III valuation under the ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ). Management of the Partnership considers a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others: demand for space; competition for tenants; changes in market rental rates; operating costs; capitalization rates; holding periods; and, discount rates. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized. No impairment loss with respect to the carrying value of the investment in an unconsolidated entity has been recorded for the period prior to acquisition on October 20, 2023.

FRONTVIEW REIT, INC. 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2024 and for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet 
 
 The adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 
 A. Reflects the unaudited historical balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2024. The Company was incorporated on June 23, 2023 and has had no activity since its inception other than the issuance of 100 shares of Common Stock for 10 per share that was initially funded with cash. 

B. Reflects the unaudited historical condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Predecessor as of September 30, 2024. 

C. Represents the net adjustments required to the historical results of the Predecessor to reflect the completion of the REIT Contribution Transactions. In connection with the REIT Contribution Transactions, existing common and preferred unit holders will contribute their interests in the Predecessor s private REIT or operating partnership, as the case may be, to the OP in exchange for OP Units or shares of Common Stock. 

Also represents the net adjustments required to the historical results of the Predecessor to reflect the completion of the Internalization. The Internalization Agreement was negotiated between the special committee (which retained its own financial and legal advisors) of the Company and NARS. Pursuant to the Internalization Agreement, NARS and certain affiliates of NARS, including certain executive officers and directors will receive 931,490 OP Units. The Internalization will be accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 805, and accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet reflects the Company s best estimate of the cost of the acquisition allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final allocation could differ materially from the preliminary allocation used in the pro forma adjustments 
 The preliminary purchase price allocation of the Internalization is fair valued at 17.7 million, representing the 931,490 OP Units to be issued multiplied by 19.00 (based on the IPO price) and comprised of the following (the final purchase price allocation could differ materially from the preliminary purchase price allocation): 
 Right-of-use lease asset and liability of an operating lease of office space of 0.6 million and 0.6 million, respectively 

Intangible asset attributable to the assembled work force of 1.2 million 

The following pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect the Internalization as it occurred on September 30, 2024: 
 Reversal of capitalized acquisition fees and leasing fees payable to NARS and its affiliates of 0.8 million, of which 0.5 million was paid with cash and the remaining 0.3 million in payables as of September 30, 2024 

Asset acquisition of an intangible asset attributable to the assembled work force of 1.2 million and a right-of-use lease asset and liability comprising of an operating lease of office space of 0.6 million and 0.6 million, respectively. The assets acquired are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date, which is assumed to be to the date of IPO. 

D. Reflects the net proceeds from the sale of 14,290,846 shares of Common Stock in this offering, at the IPO price of 19.00 per share, inclusive of the underwriters purchase of 1,090,846 shares of Common Stock at the IPO price subject to their option, net of underwriting discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The net proceeds from this offering consist of the following: 

(in thousands) 

Gross proceeds from the initial public offering 
 
 271,526 

Less: Underwriting discounts 
 
 (18,328) 

Proceeds before offering expenses paid or payable by the Company 
 
 253,198 

Estimated offering expenses paid or payable by the Company 
 
 (2,000) 

Net proceeds from the initial public offering 
 
 251,198 

31 

The pro forma adjustment reflects the allocation of net proceeds and reclassification of deferred offering related costs as follows: 

(in thousands) 

Net proceeds: par value of 14,291 shares of Common Stock issued in the offering 
 
 143 

Net proceeds: value above par value of Common Stock issued in the offering 
 
 251,055 

Deferred offering costs reclassified as an offset against additional paid-in capital 
 
 (3,191) 

Additional paid-in capital 
 
 247,864 

Deferred offering costs consist of direct, incremental legal, professional, accounting and other third-party fees, that the Predecessor incurred prior to September 30, 2024. 
 E. Reflects the following transactions related to the use of proceeds from this offering and repayment of debt: 

166.0 million to repay outstanding borrowings of 150.0 million and 16.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Credit Facility, respectively, including the write-off of 0.2 million of deferred financing fees. 

253.5 million drawn from the New Delayed Draw Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility to repay the existing indebtedness outstanding under the ABS Notes, including the write-off of 1.0 million of deferred financing fees. 

4.8 million of deferred financing fees incurred on the New Delayed Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility, net of amortization of deferred financing fees of 1.2 million. 

Adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations 
 
 The adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 
 F. Reflects the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations of the Predecessor for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

G. Represents the net adjustments required to the historical results of the Predecessor to reflect the following: 

For the five properties disposed by the Predecessor during the period from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, the results of these properties have been eliminated as they will not have a continuing impact on the Company s consolidated statement of operations, assuming completion of the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2024. No properties were disposed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 This includes the following: 

(in thousands) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 

Rental revenue 
 
 (713) 

Depreciation and amortization 
 
 (40) 

Property operating expense 
 
 (27) 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the adjustment to rental revenue includes lease termination fees of approximately 0.6 million. 
 H. Represents the adjustments required to the historical results of the Predecessor to reflect the costs incurred as a result of the Internalization. The total amount of consideration for the Internalization is 17.7 million, of which 16.5 million was determined to be a termination cost in accordance with ASC 420 of the management arrangement between the Predecessor, NARS, and certain affiliates of NARS and as such will be expensed and will be recognized at fair value and recorded as an expense at the time of the initial public offering. It should be noted that the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations may not be indicative of the Company s future results of operations because the Company expects to incur additional recurring general and administrative expenses as a result of becoming a public company, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and benefits, board of directors fees and expenses, directors and officers insurance, and incremental legal, audit, tax, consulting and other public reporting and compliance-related fees and expenses. 

The adjustment for general and administrative expenses includes stock-based compensation expense of 1.0 million and 3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These amounts represent the amortization of one-time grants of RSUs that will be issued shortly after the consummation of this offering to the Company's founder, executive officers, non-employee directors, and certain other employees, and annual grants of RSUs to be made in accordance with the 
 32 

employment agreements of the Company's executive officers. The RSUs will vest ratably over terms of approximately four and five years for the annual and one time grants, respectively. 
 The adjustment for general and administrative expenses also includes fees paid in connection with the Company s outsourcing agreement with an entity of NADG not affiliated with the Company that will provide property accounting and human resource services in the amounts of 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. respectively. 
 This adjustment also reflects the reversal of management fees paid to NARS and certain affiliates of NARS and the corresponding impact on depreciation and amortization for fees capitalized during the period in the historical financial statements of the Predecessor 
 I. Represents the reversal of interest expense (including amortization of deferred financing fees) as a result of repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Credit Facility and ABS Notes with the proceeds of this offering and funds drawn from the New Delayed Draw Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility as if the repayment occurred on January 1, 2024. For the purposes of computing the pro forma adjustment on variable-rate debt, the Company used a one-month SOFR rate of 4.96 plus the applicable margins on the debt. A change in one-month SOFR of plus or minus 0.125 , would have increased or decreased the pro forma interest expense by approximately 0.3 million. 

J. Reflects the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations of the Predecessor for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

33

Overv iew 
 We are an internally-managed net-lease REIT that is experienced in acquiring, owning and managing outparcel properties that are net leased to a diversified group of tenants. We are a growing net-lease REIT and own a well-diversified portfolio of 278 outparcel properties across 31 U.S. states as of September 30, 2024. Our tenants include service-oriented businesses, such as restaurants, cellular stores, financial institutions, automotive stores and dealers, medical and dental providers, pharmacies, convenience and gas stores, car washes, home improvement stores, grocery stores, professional services as well as general retail tenants. 
 We currently derive a majority of our revenue from rents received from individual tenants of each of our outparcel properties in our portfolio. Our properties are typically leased under long-term net leases. As of September 30, 2024, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 6.7 years, excluding renewal options. Approximately 97.4 of our leases (based on ABR) had contractual rent escalations, with an ABR weighted average annual minimum increase of 1.7 . As of September 30, 2024, we had 293 tenants that represented 137 different brands. Our top 10 tenant brands (based on ABR) represented approximately 23.3 of our portfolio ABR as of September 30, 2024. 
 In connection with our initial public offering on October 2, 2024, we completed the Internalization pursuant to which we began directly employing 15 employees and entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers. In addition, the Internalization eliminated the management and other fees and carried interest provisions that were previously paid by our predecessor. The historical results of operations for our predecessor through September 30, 2024, include the payment of management fees that we will no longer pay following the Internalization and do not include the direct compensation expense associated with our aforementioned approximately 15 employees, or other asset management, acquisition or general and administrative expenses not previously incurred based upon our externally managed structure. 
 As a private company, we historically have maintained higher leverage than we intend to maintain as a publicly-traded REIT following our initial public offering. As of September 30, 2024, we had total debt of 419.5 million, Net Debt of 409.6 million, a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 9.8x, and a pro forma Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 3.9x after giving effect to the repayment of debt with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan. Over time we plan to target a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAre ratio below 6.0x on a sustained basis. Net Debt and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures, and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre is calculated based upon EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre, each of which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Non-GAAP Measures below for further details concerning our calculation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measure. 
 Our Real Estate Investment Portf olio 
 To achieve an appropriate risk-adjusted return, we intend to maintain a highly-diversified portfolio of outparcel properties that are in prominent locations with direct frontage on high-traffic roads that are highly visible to consumers and maintain diversity across geographic locations, tenants, and brands and that have cross-diversification within each. We discuss below our portfolio diversification based on several different metrics and information provided as of September 30, 2024. 
 35 

Diversification by Tenant Brand 
 We primarily seek tenants that operate service-oriented businesses, such as restaurants, cellular stores, financial institutions, automotive stores and dealers, medical and dental providers, pharmacies, convenience and gas stores, car washes, home improvement stores, grocery stores, professional services as well as general retail tenants. As of September 30, 2024, our properties were occupied by 293 tenants that operated 137 different brands, with no single tenant brand accounting for more than 3.4 of our ABR. 
 The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our top 20 tenant brands (based on ABR) as of September 30, 2024:

Our Leases 
 Lease Maturity 
 Our portfolio was approximately 98.9 leased as of September 30, 2024. Our cash flows from operations are primarily generated through our real estate investment portfolio and the monthly lease payments received under our long-term leases with our tenants. As of September 30, 2024, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 6.7 years, excluding renewal options, and approximately 96.3 of such leases (based on ABR) have renewal options remaining. As of September 30, 2024, no more than 13.7 of our rental revenue was derived from leases that expire in any single year prior to 2030. 
 39 

The following chart sets forth our annual lease expirations based upon the terms of our leases in place as of September 30, 2024 (percentages based on rental revenue): 

Because substantially all of our properties are leased under long-term leases, we are not currently required to perform significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. We have three leases, representing approximately 0.9 of our ABR, that will expire prior to December 31, 2024, each with tenant renewal options.

We typically purchase properties that are subject to existing long-term net leases with a range of lease terms (initial terms of 10 years or more at lease signing that often have renewal options as well). Substantially all of our leases are net leases, meaning our tenant generally is obligated to pay customary expenses associated with the leased property (such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, and in many cases, capital costs, subject to caps and exclusions in some leases). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred an aggregate of approximately 1.3 million of expenses not reimbursed or paid by our tenants, which includes non-recurring legal costs and property operating expenses incurred on vacant properties. 
 Approximately 97.4 of our leases (based on ABR) provide for periodic contractual rent escalations, generally ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 annually, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 1.7 per annum. 
 The following chart breaks down the type of rent increase provided in our leases (based on ABR) as of September 30, 2024: 
 Lease Escalations 

In general, when negotiating a new lease or an amendment to an existing lease in connection with an acquisition, redevelopment or new development, we seek to negotiate, among other things, relatively long lease terms and tenant renewal options; market rents; annual rent escalation provisions; landlord-favorable going dark, assignment, change of control provisions; limited or no exclusive or co-tenancy clauses that favor the tenant and obligations for certain tenants and certain guarantors to periodically provide us with financial information. 
 In the future, we may seek to use master lease structures where it fits market practice in the particular property type, pursuant to which we seek to lease multiple properties to an individual tenant on an all or none basis. In a master lease structure, a tenant is responsible for a single lease payment relating to the entire portfolio of leased properties, as opposed to multiple lease payments relating to individually leased properties. The master lease structure prevents a tenant from cherry picking locations, where it unilaterally gives up underperforming properties while maintaining its leasehold interest in well-performing properties.

The 2.5 million increase in contractual rental amounts billed was primarily attributable to a 2.0 million increase in contractual base rent from the consolidation of the 54 properties acquired as part of the 50/50 Joint Venture Acquisition, a 0.2 million increase in contractual base rent from the growth of our real estate portfolio through new acquisitions during 2023, and 0.7 million in same-store rent growth from our in-place lease escalations, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in contractual base rent from properties sold throughout the latter part of 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. 
 The 0.7 million increase in variable rental amounts earned was mainly due to lease termination fees received during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 The 1.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due the consolidation of the 54 properties acquired as part of the 50/50 Joint Venture Acquisition and the growth of our real estate portfolio through new acquisitions in 2023. 
 42 

Property operating expenses 
 
 The 0.7 million increase in property operating expenses was mainly due to the increase in number of properties in our portfolio. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 2.0 million and 1.3 million of property operating expenses, respectively, and recorded 1.2 million and 1.0 million of additional rent and recovery income included in the contract rental amounts billed, respectively. Substantially all of our leases are net leases pursuant to which our tenants generally are obligated to pay customary expenses associated with the leased property such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, and in many cases capital costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 0.8 million in aggregate of expenses that were not tenant obligations, which includes non-recurring legal costs and property operating expenses incurred on vacant properties. 
 
 General and Administrative expenses 
 The 2.3 million decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to approximately 1.4 million in structuring and public company readiness costs and 1.3 million in Internalization expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Upon completion of the Internalization and the initial public offering, our future general and administrative expenses will include, among other things, the direct employee compensation expense of 15 new employees. 
 
 Other expenses and income 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we drew an additional 73.9 million from the Revolving Credit Facility, which bears interest at a rate of SOFR plus 2.36 , to fund new acquisitions of real estate properties. In addition, as part of the 50/50 Joint Venture Acquisition, we consolidated the 50/50 Joint Venture s share of the ABS debt of approximately 69.7 million, which bears interest at approximately 3.4 and the Term Loan of 17 million, which bears interest at Term SOFR plus 1.8 . The increase in borrowings from the Revolving Credit Facility and the assumption of debt relating to the 50/50 Joint Venture Acquisition, resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 0.9 million for CIBC debt (Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan) and 0.6 million for ABS debt, in addition to amortization of discount costs of 0.6 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This 2.1 million increase is offset by a decrease in amortization of financing costs of approximately 0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the aggregate debt outstanding has a weighted average interest rate excluding amortization of deferred financing costs of 4.96 and 5.20 , respectively.

The 9.5 million increase in contractual rental amounts billed was primarily attributable to a 7.0 million increase in contractual base rent from the consolidation of the 54 properties acquired as part of the 50/50 Joint Venture Acquisition, a 2.3 million increase from growth of our real estate portfolio through new acquisitions during 2023, and 1.5 million of same-store rent growth from our in-place lease escalations, partially offset by a 1.2 million decrease in contractual base rent from properties sold throughout the latter part of 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 The 1.4 million increase in variable rental amounts earned was mainly due to lease termination fees received during the nine months ended September 30 2024. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 
 The 4.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the consolidation of the 54 properties acquired as part of the 50/50 Joint Venture Acquisition and the growth of our real estate portfolio through new acquisitions in 2023. 
 Property operating expenses 
 
 The 1.8 million increase in property operating expenses was mainly due to the increase in number of properties in our portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we incurred 5.7 million and 3.9 million of property operating expenses, respectively, and recorded 4.4 million and 3.4 million of additional rent and recovery income included in the contract rental amounts billed, respectively. Substantially all of our leases are net leases pursuant to which our tenants generally are obligated to pay customary expenses associated with the leased property such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, and in many cases capital costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 1.3 million in aggregate of expenses that were not tenant obligations, which includes non-recurring legal costs and property operating expenses incurred on vacant properties. 
 General and Administrative expenses 
 
 The 4.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to approximately 3.1 million in structuring and public company readiness costs and 1.8 million in Internalization expenses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This 4.9 million is offset by a 0.8 million increase in audit, tax and consulting incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Upon completion of the Internalization and the IPO, our future general and administrative expenses will include, among other things, the direct employee compensation expense of 15 new employees. 
 Other expenses and income 
 Interest expense 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we drew an additional 73.9 million from the Revolving Credit Facility, which bears interest at a rate of SOFR plus 2.36 , to fund new acquisitions of real estate properties. In addition, as part of the 50/50 Joint Venture Acquisition, we consolidated the 50/50 Joint Venture s share of the ABS debt of approximately 69.7 million, which bears interest at approximately 3.4 and the Term Loan of 17 million, which bears interest at Term SOFR plus 1.8 . The increase in borrowings from 
 44 

the Revolving Credit Facility and the assumption of debt relating to the 50/50 Joint Venture Acquisition, resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 5.0 million for CIBC debt (Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan) and 1.7 million for ABS debt, in addition to amortization of discount costs of 1.8 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This 8.5 million increase is offset by a decrease in amortization of financing costs of approximately 0.5 million. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the aggregate debt outstanding has a weighted average interest rate excluding amortization of deferred financing costs of 4.96 and 5.20 , respectively. 
 Gain on sale of real estate 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold five properties at a net gain of approximately 0.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold one property at loss of approximately 0.3 million. 
 Impairment loss 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment loss of 0.6 million relating to an asset held for investment. The amount of impairment fluctuates each period based on existing facts and circumstances. 
 Liquidity and Cap ital Resources 
 Liquidity/REIT Requirements 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including our ongoing commitments to repay debt, fund our operations, acquire properties, make distributions to our stockholders, and other general business needs. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As a result, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances to meet our liquidity needs from our annual taxable income. Instead, we expect to meet our liquidity needs primarily by relying upon external sources of capital, such as borrowings under our debt facilities or additional equity or preferred offerings or other capital raises, which would all be subject to a number of market and other factors in order to be successfully accessible. 
 Short-term Liquidity Requirements 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses as well as interest payments on our outstanding debt and to pay distributions. Since our portfolio has had a historically strong occupancy level and substantially all of our leases are net leases, we do not currently anticipate making significant capital expenditures or incurring other significant property operating costs (unless vacancies adjust beyond historical norms) that would materially adversely impact short-term financial liquidity. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from cash and cash equivalents balances, net cash provided by operating activities, and borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan or through the issuance of debt or equity instruments subject to market conditions. 
 Long-term Liquidity Requirements 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to repay debt, including 253.2 million of debt (net of fees) that is anticipated to be repaid in December 2024, and to invest in additional revenue generating properties. Debt capital is provided through our New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan, as well as potentially through the issuance of debt and equity instruments subject to market conditions and Company operating performance. The source and mix of our debt capital in the future will be impacted by market conditions. We plan to prudently balance our debt portfolio with a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and will evaluate opportunities to hedge certain interest rate risk where appropriate. 
 We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan, any future debt and equity financings, and proceeds from limited sales of our properties. Our ability to access these capital sources may be impacted by unfavorable market conditions, particularly in the debt and equity capital markets and the real estate market in general, that are outside of our control. In addition, our success will depend on our operating performance, our borrowing restrictions, our degree of leverage, market perceptions of the Company, our access to debt, equity or other capital instruments and other factors. Our acquisition growth strategy significantly depends on our ability to obtain acquisition-financing on favorable terms. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by strengthening our balance sheet by investing in real estate with creditworthy tenants and lease guarantors, and by maintaining an appropriate mix of debt and equity capitalization. 
 45 

Pro Forma Liquidity and Capital 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had on a pro forma basis 93.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, upon completion of the initial public offering and following the repayment of our obligations under the ABS Notes in December, we expect to have 196.5 million of available borrowing capacity under our New Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that following completion of our initial public offering, we have access to capital sufficient to meet our capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. 
 Target Leverage 
 We have pro forma total debt outstanding of 249.9 million (net of fees), pro forma Net Debt of 160.2 million, and a pro forma Net Debt-to-Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of approximately 3.9x. Our long-term goal is to target a net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 6.0x or below. We may from time to time modify our leverage policy in light of then current economic conditions, relative costs and availability of debt and equity capital, changes in the market price of our Common Stock, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. 
 Equity Capital Resources 
 As a new publicly traded REIT we plan to access the public equity markets to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity in line with our leverage policy, primarily through follow-on equity offerings and eventually through an at-the-market common equity offering program ATM Program once we are shelf eligible. Our public offerings will be used to repay debt, fund acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. 
 Description of Certain Debt Outstanding After Our Initial Public Offering 
 The following is a summary of the material provisions of our ABS Notes, New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan. 
 ABS Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, 253.2 million aggregate principal amount of the ABS Notes issued by affiliates of our predecessor were outstanding (net of fees) and interest on the ABS Notes accrues at an annual rate equal to 3.4 . The anticipated repayment date for the ABS Notes is in December 2024. The ABS Notes are secured by liens on 132 outparcel properties, which represented 47.5 of our total outparcel properties based on the number of properties as of September 30, 2024. 
 New Revolving Credit Facility 
 Upon closing of our initial public offering, a group of lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acts as administrative agent, provided commitments for our New Revolving Credit Facility, allowing borrowings of up to 250 million, including 20 million available for issuance of letters of credit. Our New Revolving Credit Facility has an initial maturity in October 2027 together with two 12-month extension options, subject to certain conditions, including payment of a 0.125 fee on the aggregate outstanding amount of the revolving commitments. 
 The New Revolving Credit Facility contains a commitment fee of 0.15 per annum if average daily usage in such quarter is over 50 of total revolving commitments and 0.25 per annum if average daily usage in such quarter is equal to or less than 50 of total revolving commitments. Borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates based on adjusted SOFR plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio ranging between 1.20 and 1.75 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margin was 1.20 . 
 
 The New Revolving Credit Facility contains an applicable facility fee based on our credit rating ranging between 0.125 and 0.30 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable facility fee was 0.30 . 
 New Delayed Draw Term Loan 
 Upon closing of our initial public offering, a group of lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, provided commitments for our New Delayed Draw Term Loan, allowing borrowings of up to 200 million. Our New Delayed Draw Term Loan is available to be drawn until October 2025 and has an initial maturity of October 2027 together with two 12-month extension options, at our election, subject to certain conditions including payment of a 0.125 fee on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loan. We plan to use the New Delayed Draw Term Loan to repay our ABS Notes when they mature in December 2024. Our New Delayed Draw Term Loan includes a ticking fee of 0.20 per annum on the average daily amount of unfunded term loan commitments. 
 46 

Borrowings under our New Delayed Draw Term Loan bear interest at floating rates based on Adjusted SOFR plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio ranging between 1.20 and 1.75 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margin was 1.20 . 
 Covenants 
 
 We will be subject to various covenants and financial reporting requirements pursuant to our New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan. The table below summarizes the applicable financial covenants. If a default or event of default exists, either through default on payments or breach of covenants, we may be restricted from paying dividends to our stockholders in excess of dividends required to maintain our REIT qualification.

(b) 
 Interest expense is projected based on the outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024. 

(c) 
 Amounts include acquisitions under control, defined as under contract or executed letter of intent. 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 We may be exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on any floating-rate borrowings that we make under our New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan or other debt or capital instruments that bear interest. Borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan will bear interest at floating rates based on SOFR plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense, which will in turn, decrease or increase our net income and cash flow. 
 In the future, we may attempt to manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps or other hedging arrangements. Under these agreements, we will receive monthly payments from the counterparties equal to the related variable interest rates multiplied by the outstanding notional amounts. In turn, we pay the counterparties each month an amount equal to a fixed interest rate multiplied by the related outstanding notional amounts. The intended net impact of these transactions is that we pay a fixed interest rate on our variable-rate borrowings. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.

Cash Flows 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 9.9 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 15.2 million as of September 30, 2023. The table below shows information concerning cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

(7,234) 

(25,904) 

The change in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 was mainly due to increase in rental revenues of approximately 10.5 million offset by approximately 7.9 million increase in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 1.3 million of one-time structuring and public company readiness costs paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The remainder of the change in net cash provided by operating activities relates to timing of payment of payables and accrued liabilities. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were five properties sold and no properties acquired compared to one property sold and 25 properties acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which is reflected in the change in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities. 
 
 The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is mainly due to a net repayment of debt, net of 20.9 million compared to 39.8 million net proceeds from debt, net, respectively. 
 Non-G AAP Financial Measures 
 Our reported results and net earnings per diluted share are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose FFO, AFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, annualized adjusted EBITDAre and net debt, each of which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit. Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains (losses) from sales of certain depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment charges related to certain previously depreciated real estate assets. To derive AFFO, we modify the Nareit computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain non-cash or non-recurring revenues and expenses, including straight-line rents, cost of debt extinguishments, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of net mortgage premiums, (gain) loss on interest rate swaps and other non-cash interest expense, realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, Internalization expenses, structuring and public company readiness costs, extraordinary items, and other specified non-cash items. We believe that such items are not a result of normal operations and thus we believe excluding such items assists management and investors in distinguishing whether changes in our operations are due to growth or decline of operations at our properties or from other factors. 
 Our leases typically include cash rents that increase through lease escalations over the term of the lease. Our leases do not typically include significant front-loading or back-loading of payments, or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. We further exclude costs or gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense and gains, the amortization of debt issuance costs, net mortgage premiums, and lease intangibles, realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, Internalization expenses, and structuring and public company readiness costs, as these items are not indicative of ongoing operational results. We use AFFO as a measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals. 
 FFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers, primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by one-time cash and non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs, and comparisons of our FFO and AFFO with the 
 48 

same or similar measures disclosed by other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. 
 Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments to FFO that we use to calculate AFFO. In the future, the SEC, Nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of AFFO accordingly. 
 The following is a reconciliation of historical and pro forma net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO:

We compute EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in our industry. We believe that this ratio provides investors and analysts with a measure of our leverage that includes our operating results unaffected by the differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets compared to other companies in our industry. In 2017, Nareit issued a white paper recommending that companies that report EBITDA also report EBITDAre in financial reports. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by Nareit. Nareit defines EBITDAre as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding gains (loss) from the sales of depreciable property and provisions for impairment on investment in real estate. We believe EBITDA and EBITDAre are useful to investors and analysts because they provide important supplemental information about our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. 
 EBITDA and EBITDAre are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDA and EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 49 

We compute adjusted EBITDAre as EBITDAre for the applicable quarter, as adjusted to (i) reflect all investment and disposition activity that took place during the applicable quarter as if each transaction had been completed on the first day of the quarter, (ii) exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that we believe are infrequent and unusual in nature because they relate to unique circumstances or transactions that had not previously occurred and which we do not anticipate occurring in the future, (iii) eliminate the impact of lease termination fees from certain of our tenants, and (iv) exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Annualized adjusted EBITDAre is calculated by multiplying adjusted EBITDAre for the applicable quarter by four, which we believe provides a meaningful estimate of our current run rate for all of our investments as of the end of the most recently completed quarter given the contractual nature of our long term net leases. You should not unduly rely on this measure as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our actual reported EBITDAre for future periods may be significantly different from our annualized adjusted EBITDAre. 
 The following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable to GAAP measure) to EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, and annualized adjusted EBITDAre.

Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Net Debt as our Gross Debt less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The ratios of Net Debt to EBITDAre and Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre represent Net Debt as of the end of the applicable period divided by EBITDAre or Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre for the period, respectively. We believe that these ratios are useful to investors and analysts because they provide information about Gross Debt less cash and cash equivalents, which could be useful to repay debt, compared to our performance as measured using EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, which are described above.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of the historical consolidated financial statements in conformance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as other disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions, however, our actual results could differ materially from our estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 Accounting Policies for Financial Statements, contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Purchase Price Allocation of Acquired Properties 
 Upon acquisition of real estate held for investment considered to be an asset acquisition, we capitalized the purchase price (including related acquisition costs) as part of the cost basis. We allocate the purchase price between land, buildings and improvements, site improvements, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in-place leases and origination costs acquired, above- and below-market leases, based upon their fair values. The allocation of the purchase price requires judgment and significant estimates. The fair value of the land and building assets is determined on an as-if-vacant basis. 
 Above- and below-market leases are based upon a comparison between existing leases upon acquisition and current market rents for similar real estate. The fair value of above- and below-market leases is equal to the aggregate present value of the spread between the contract and the market rate of each of the in-place leases over their remaining term. The fair values of in-place leases and origination costs are determined based on the estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods and costs that would be incurred to put the existing leases in place under the same market terms and conditions. 
 We use multiple sources to estimate fair value, including information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities. We also consider information and other factors that impact the determination of fair value such as market conditions, industry conditions that the tenant operates in, characteristics of the real estate (e.g., location, size, value of comparative rental rates, traffic count) and tenant credit profile. 
 51 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The net recoverable amount represents the undiscounted estimated future cash flow expected to be earned from the long-lived asset. In the case of real estate, the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are based on expected cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the property. We estimate fair value using data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates or multiples, and with regards to assets held for sale, negotiated selling price, less estimated costs of disposal. 
 Impact of Recent Accou nting Pronouncements 
 For information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 52 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We may be exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on any floating-rate borrowings we make under our New Revolving Credit Facility or New Delayed Draw Term Loan or other debt or other capital instruments that bear interest. Borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan will bear interest at floating rates based on SOFR plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense, which will in turn, decrease or increase our net income and cash flow. In the future, we may manage a portion of our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps or other hedging arrangements. To the extent that we seek to do so, our interest rate risk management strategy will be intended to stabilize cash flow requirements by maintaining interest rate swaps to convert certain variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. Refinancing of any of our debt instruments would also be subject to market conditions at the time of such refinancing and our operational performance, which could require principal paydowns and equity injections due to limited financing sources being available at the time. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our financial instruments were not exposed to significant market risk due to foreign currency exchange risk or other relevant market rates or prices. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the foregoing, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Part II OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we are subject to various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are not aware of any material legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party or to which any of our property is subject, nor are we aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by government agencies. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Prospectus filed with the SEC on October 2, 2024. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 On October 3, 2024, we closed our IPO of 13,200,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 19.00 per share, with a subsequent exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase from us an additional 1,090,846 shares of common stock that closed on October 23, 2024. We raised net proceeds of 253.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 18.3 million. All shares sold were registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-282015), as amended (the Registration Statement ), which was declared effective by the SEC on October 1, 2024. Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and BofA Securities, Inc. acted as representatives of the underwriters for the IPO. The offering terminated after the sale of all securities registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. We contributed the net proceeds to the OP in 
 53 

exchange for OP units. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Credit Facility. There has been no material change in the use of proceeds from our IPO as described in the Prospectus. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 Item 4. Mine Saf ety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 5. Other Information. 
 None of our officers or directors or any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
