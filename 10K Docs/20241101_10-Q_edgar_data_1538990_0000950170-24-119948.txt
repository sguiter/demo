billion and billion, respectively, and had third-party liabilities totaling billion and billion, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these VIEs held assets totaling million and million, respectively, and had third-party liabilities totaling million and million, respectively. These assets and liabilities are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company is required to continually evaluate its VIE relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either: (i) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) substantially all of an entity s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights, or (iii) the equity investors as a group lack any of the following: (a) the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity. The designation of an entity as a VIE is reassessed upon certain events, including, but not limited to: (i) a change to the contractual arrangements of the entity or in the ability of a party to exercise its participation or kick-out rights, (ii) a change to the capitalization structure of the entity, or (iii) acquisitions or sales of interests that constitute a change in control. A variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, which activities most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the ability to direct those activities, the variable interest holder s form of ownership interest, the variable interest holder s representation on the VIE s governing body, the size and seniority of the variable interest holder s investment, the variable interest holder s ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, the variable interest holder s ability to manage its ownership interest relative to the other interest holders, and the variable interest holder s ability to replace the VIE manager and/or liquidate the entity. For its investments in entities that are not considered to be VIEs, the Company evaluates the type of ownership rights held by each party with an interest in the entity to determine if the Company holds a controlling financial interest. The assessment of whether the Company holds a controlling financial interest is made at inception of the entity and continually reassessed. Consolidated VIE The Company holds a ownership interest in and is the managing member of a joint venture entity formed in December 2023 that owns and leases real estate to lessees that are affiliates of the noncontrolling interest holder. The Company also provided a million loan to the joint venture. The Company classifies the joint venture as a VIE, as the equity holders do not have the obligation to absorb all future losses of the joint venture due to a provision that protects the equity holders from certain losses if an event of default occurs under the leases. The Company consolidates the joint venture as the primary beneficiary because it has the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. The assets of the joint venture primarily consist of leased properties (net lease real estate accounted for as financing arrangements) and cash; its obligations primarily consist of debt service payments to the Company, which are eliminated in consolidation. Accounting for the Merger The Merger was accounted for using the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ASC Topic 805 ), which requires that the cost of an acquisition be allocated on a relative fair value basis to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed. Direct transaction costs incurred by STORE Capital LLC as the acquirer and amounts transferred to reimburse STORE Capital Corporation for costs incurred as the acquiree to sell the business are included in the consideration transferred and capitalized as a component of the cost of the assets acquired. An assembled workforce intangible asset is recorded at the acquisition date if it is part of the asset group acquired. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition and consideration transferred in excess over the fair value of the net assets acquired, if any, is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable assets and liabilities. See Note 10 of the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as filed with the SEC in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

reportable segment. 
 primary transaction types as summarized below. At the beginning of 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASC Topic 842 which had an impact on certain accounting related to the Company s investment portfolio. Real Estate Investments investments are generally made in one of two ways, either through sale-leaseback transactions in which the Company acquires the real estate from the owner-operators and then leases the real estate back to them, or through acquisitions from third-party sellers in connection with which a new lease is entered into with the tenant. Both approaches result in long-term leases which are generally classified as operating leases and, in both cases, the operators become the Company s long term tenants (its customers). In certain instances, the terms of the lease result in classification as a finance lease instead of an operating lease. Furthermore, certain of the lease contracts that are specifically associated with a sale-leaseback transaction may contain terms, such as a tenant purchase option, which results in the transaction being accounted for as a financing arrangement, due to the Company s adoption of ASC Topic 842, rather than as an investment in real estate subject to an operating or finance lease. 

 Mortgage Loans Receivable investments are made by issuing mortgage loans to the owner-operators of the real estate that serves as the collateral for the loans and the operators become long-term borrowers and customers of the Company. On occasion, the Company may also make other types of loans to its customers, such as equipment loans. 

 Hybrid Real Estate Investments investments are made through modified sale-leaseback transactions, where the Company acquires land from the owner-operators, leases the land back through long-term leases and simultaneously issues mortgage loans to the operators secured by the buildings and improvements on the land. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC Topic 842, new or modified hybrid real estate investment transactions are generally accounted for as operating leases of the land and mortgage loans on the buildings and improvements.

to years for buildings and is generally to years for land improvements. Properties classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less anticipated selling costs. Any properties classified as held for sale are not depreciated. 
 million and million, respectively, of straight-line operating lease receivables. Leases that have contingent rent escalators indexed to future increases in the Consumer Price Index CPI may adjust over a period or over multiple year periods. Often, these escalators increase rent at (a) to times the increase in the CPI over a specified period or (b) a fixed percentage. Because of the volatility and uncertainty with respect to future changes in the CPI, the Company s inability to determine the extent to which any specific future change in the CPI is probable at each rent adjustment date during the entire term of these leases and the Company s view that the multiplier does not represent a significant leverage factor, increases in rental revenue from leases with this type of escalator are recognized only after the changes in the rental rates have actually occurred. In addition to base rental revenue, certain leases also have contingent rentals that are based on a percentage of the tenant s gross sales; the Company recognizes contingent rental revenue when the threshold upon which the contingent lease payment is based is achieved. Approximately of the Company s investment portfolio is subject to leases that provide for contingent rent based on a percentage of the tenant s gross sales; historically, contingent rent recognized has been less than of rental revenues. The Company reviews its operating lease receivables for collectibility on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area where the property is located. In the event that the collectibility of lease payments with respect to any tenant is not probable, a direct write off of the receivable is made and any future rental revenue is recognized only when the tenant makes a rental payment or when collectibility is again deemed probable. Direct costs incremental to successful lease origination, offset by any lease origination fees received, are deferred and amortized over the related lease term as an adjustment to rental revenue. The Company periodically commits to fund the construction of new properties for its customers; rental revenue collected during the construction period is deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term when the construction project is complete. Substantially all of the Company s leases are triple net, which means that the lessees are directly responsible for the payment of all property operating expenses, including property taxes, maintenance and insurance. For a few lease contracts, the Company collects property taxes from its customers and remits those taxes to governmental authorities.

million and million, respectively. For the assets impaired in 2024, the estimated aggregate fair value of the impaired real estate assets at the time of impairment aggregated million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from February 3, 2023 through September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an aggregate provision for the impairment of real estate of million and million, respectively. impairment of real estate was recognized during the period from January 1, 2023 through February 2, 2023. 
 days past due, or earlier if management determines that full recovery of the contractually specified payments of principal and interest is doubtful. While on nonaccrual status, interest income is recognized only when received. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had loans receivable with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million and million, respectively, on nonaccrual status. 
 Impairment and Provision for Credit Losses The Company accounts for provision of credit losses in accordance with ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses Topic 326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASC Topic 326 ). In accordance with ASC Topic 326, the Company evaluates the collectibility of its loans and financing receivables at the time each financing receivable is issued and subsequently on a quarterly basis utilizing an expected credit loss model based on credit quality indicators. The primary credit quality indicator is the implied credit rating associated with each borrower, utilizing categories, investment grade and non-investment grade. The Company computes implied credit ratings based on regularly received borrower financial statements using Moody s Analytics RiskCalc. The Company considers the implied credit ratings, loan and financing receivable term to maturity and underlying collateral value and quality, if any, to calculate the expected credit loss over the remaining life of the receivable. Loans are written off against the allowance for credit loss when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company recognized an estimated million and million, respectively, provision for credit losses related to its loans and financing receivables; the provision for credit losses is included in provisions for impairment on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from February 3, 2023 through September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an estimated million and million, respectively, of provisions for credit losses. For the period from January 1, 2023 through February 2, 2023, provisions for credit

In the event an executive officer s employment terminates under certain circumstances, the Company would be liable for cash severance and continuation of healthcare benefits under the terms of the employee agreements.

In addition to the disclosures for assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value at the balance sheet date, companies are required to disclose the estimated fair values of all financial instruments, even if they are not carried at their fair value. The fair values of financial instruments are estimates based on market conditions and perceived risks at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These estimates require management s judgment and may not be indicative of the future fair values of the assets and liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities for which the carrying values approximate their fair values include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and tenant deposits. Generally, these assets and liabilities are short term in duration and are recorded at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company believes the carrying value of the borrowings on its credit facility approximate fair value based on their nature, terms and variable interest rate. Additionally, the Company believes the current carrying values of its fixed rate loans receivable approximate fair values based on market quotes for comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses using estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows, market rates and credit spreads. The estimated fair values of the Company s aggregate long-term debt obligations have been derived based on market observable inputs such as interest rates and discounted cash flow analyses using estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows, market rates and credit spreads. These measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2024, these debt obligations had an aggregate carrying value of billion and an estimated fair value of billion. At December 31, 2023, these debt obligations had an aggregate carrying value of billion and an estimated fair value of billion.

 Following the Merger, we are a Delaware limited liability company organized as an internally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute all our taxable income to our members and meet other requirements. 
 For the periods prior to the Merger, we present the results of operations for STORE Capital Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Predecessor ). For the periods after the Merger, we present the results of operations for STORE Capital LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Successor ). The nine months ended September 30, 2023 (the Combined Period include the results of operations for the Predecessor during the period of January 1, 2023 through February 2, 2023 and the results of operations for the Successor during the period February 3, 2023 through September 30, 2023. 
 Overview 
 We invest in Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, or STORE Property, which is our target market and the inspiration for our name. A STORE Property is a property location at which a company operates its business and generates sales and profits, which makes the location a profit center and, therefore, fundamentally important to that business. Due to the long-term nature of our leases, we focus our acquisition activity on properties that operate in industries we believe have long-term relevance, the majority of which are service industries. By acquiring the real estate from the operators and then leasing the real estate back to them, the operators 
 29 

become our long-term tenants, and we refer to them as our customers. Through the execution of these sale-leaseback transactions, we fill a need for our customers by providing them a source of long-term capital that enables them to avoid the need to incur debt and/or employ equity in order to finance the real estate that is essential to their business. 
 All the real estate we acquire is held by our wholly or majority owned subsidiaries, many of which are special purpose bankruptcy remote entities formed to facilitate the financing of our real estate. We predominantly acquire our single tenant properties directly from our customers in sale leaseback transactions where our customers sell us their operating properties and then simultaneously enter into long term triple net leases with us to lease the properties back. Accordingly, our properties are fully occupied and under lease from the moment we acquire them. 
 We generate our cash from operations primarily through the monthly lease payments, or base rent, we receive from our customers under their long-term leases with us. We also receive interest payments on loans receivable, which are a smaller part of our portfolio. We refer to the monthly scheduled lease and interest payments due from our customers as base rent and interest. Most of our leases contain lease escalations every year or every several years that are based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index or a stated percentage, which allows the monthly lease payments we receive to increase over the life of the lease contracts. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 99 of our leases (based on base rent) were triple-net leases, which means that our customers are responsible for all the operating costs such as maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us, including any increases in those costs that may occur as a result of inflation. The remaining leases have some landlord responsibilities, generally related to maintenance and structural component replacement that may be required on such properties in the future, although we do not currently anticipate incurring significant capital expenditures or property-level operating costs under such leases. Because our properties are single tenant properties, almost all of which are under long-term leases, it is not necessary for us to perform any significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. 
 We have a dedicated internal team that reviews and analyzes ongoing customer financial performance, both at the corporate level and with respect to each property we own, to identify properties that may no longer be part of our long-term strategic plan and as such, we may from time to time decide to sell properties. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio stood at approximately 15.3 billion, consisting of investments in 3,245 property locations. Substantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio. 
 Our primary cash expenditures are the principal and interest payments we make on the debt we use to finance our real estate investment portfolio and the general and administrative expenses of managing the portfolio and operating our business. Since substantially all our leases are triple net, our tenants are generally responsible for the maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us. When a property becomes vacant through a tenant default or expiration of the lease term with no tenant renewal, we incur the property costs not paid by the tenant, as well as those property costs accruing during the time it takes to locate a substitute tenant or sell the property. We expect to incur some property-level operating costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being remarketed. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations or may be unable to pay such costs in a timely manner. Property costs are generally not significant to our operations, but the amount of property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties. We may advance certain property costs on behalf of our tenants but expect that the majority of these costs will be reimbursed by the tenant and do not anticipate that they will be significant to our operations. 
 We intend to continue to grow through additional real estate investments. To accomplish this objective, we must continue to identify real estate acquisitions that are consistent with our underwriting guidelines and raise future additional capital to make such acquisitions. We acquire real estate with a combination of debt and equity capital, proceeds from the sale of properties and cash from operations that is not otherwise distributed to our members in the form of distributions. We also periodically commit to fund the construction of new properties for our customers or to provide them funds to improve and/or renovate properties we lease to them. These additional investments will generally result in increases to the rental revenue or interest income due under the related contracts. 
 Financing Strategy 
 Our debt capital is initially provided on a short-term, temporary basis through a multi-year, variable-rate unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. We manage our long-term leverage position through the strategic and economic issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt on both a secured and unsecured basis. By matching the expected cash inflows from our long-term real estate leases with the expected cash outflows of our long-term fixed-rate debt, we lock in , for as long as is economically feasible, the expected positive difference between our scheduled cash inflows on the leases and the cash outflows on our debt payments. By 
 30 

locking in this difference, or spread, we seek to reduce the risk that increases in interest rates would adversely impact our profitability. In addition, we use various financial instruments designed to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. We also ladder our debt maturities in order to minimize the gap between our free cash flow (which we define as our cash from operations less distributions) and our annual debt maturities. 
 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
 We have a credit agreement with a group of lenders which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility has a borrowing capacity of 753.9 million, matures in February 2027 and includes two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions and the payment of a 0.075 extension fee. As of September 30, 2024, we had 375.0 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 Borrowings under the facility require monthly payments of interest at a rate selected by us of either (1) SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10 , plus a spread ranging from 1.00 to 1.45 , or (2) the Base Rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus a spread ranging from 0.00 to 0.45 . The spread used is based on our consolidated total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. We are also required to pay a facility fee on the total commitment amount ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 based on our consolidated total leverage ratio. Currently, the applicable spread for SOFR-based borrowings is 1.10 and the facility fee is 0.20 . Our credit agreement allows for a further reduction in the pricing of one basis point if certain environmental sustainability metrics are met. As of September 30, 2024, we had three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 375.0 million that effectively convert the outstanding borrowings on the facility to an all-in fixed rate of 4.5950 . 
 Under the terms of the facility, we are subject to various restrictive financial and nonfinancial covenants which, among other things, require us to maintain certain leverage ratios, cash flow and debt service coverage ratios and secured borrowing ratios. Certain of these ratios are based on our pool of unencumbered assets, which aggregated approximately 10.1 billion at September 30, 2024. The facility is recourse to us, and, as of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial and nonfinancial covenants under the facility. 
 Senior Unsecured Term Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of 1.4 billion of public senior unsecured notes outstanding. These senior unsecured notes bear a weighted average coupon rate of 3.63 and interest on these notes is paid semi-annually. The supplemental indentures governing our public notes contain various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 Prior to the inaugural issuance of public debt in March 2018, unsecured long-term debt had been issued through the private placement of notes to institutional investors. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of 114.4 million of privately placed notes outstanding. The financial covenants of the privately placed notes are similar to our current unsecured revolving credit facility, and, as of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 We have a credit agreement with a group of lenders which provides for two unsecured, variable-rate term loans. The loans consist of an unsecured, variable-rate term loan issued in February 2023 February 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and an unsecured, variable-rate term loan issued in December 2023 December 2023 Unsecured Term Loan ). 
 The February 2023 Unsecured Term Loan had initial borrowings of 600.0 million and was amended throughout 2023 to increase total borrowings to 921.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The February 2023 Unsecured Term Loan matures in April 2027 and the interest rate resets daily at Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10 , plus a spread ranging from 1.10 to 1.70 based on our consolidated total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, our spread was 1.25 . Our credit agreement allows for a further reduction in the pricing of one basis point if certain environmental sustainability metrics are met. As of September 30, 2024, we had 11 interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 921.1 million that effectively convert the term loan borrowings to an all-in fixed interest rate of 4.3469 for the remaining term of the loan. 
 The December 2023 Unsecured Term Loan had borrowings of 592.5 million as of December 31, 2023. In January 2024, we entered into an incremental amendment of the existing credit agreement which provided for an increase to the December 2023 Unsecured Term Loan of 135.0 million for total term loan borrowings of 727.5 million as of September 30, 2024. The December 2023 Unsecured Term Loan matures in July 2026 and includes two 12-month extensions. The interest rate resets daily at Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10 , plus a spread ranging from 1.20 to 1.80 based on our consolidated total leverage ratio as 
 31 

defined in the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the spread applicable to the Company was 1.35 . Our credit agreement allows for a further reduction in the pricing of one basis point if certain environmental sustainability metrics are met. 
 During 2023, we entered into six interest rate swap agreements, with an aggregate notional value of 592.5 million, which effectively convert the borrowings as of December 31, 2023 to an all-in fixed rate of 5.4520 for the remaining term of the loan. In conjunction with the incremental amendment in January 2024, we entered into one interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of 135.0 million which effectively converts the total incremental borrowings to a fixed rate of 5.0095 . 
 The aggregate outstanding principal amount of our unsecured senior notes and term loans payable was 3.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 Non-recourse Secured Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 32 of our real estate investment portfolio served as collateral for outstanding borrowings under our STORE Master Funding debt program. We believe our STORE Master Funding program allows for flexibility not commonly found in non-recourse debt, often making it preferable to traditional debt issued in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. Under the program, STORE Capital serves as both master and special servicer for the collateral pool, allowing for active portfolio monitoring and prompt issue resolution. In addition, features of the program allowing for the sale or substitution of collateral, provided certain criteria are met, facilitate active portfolio management. Through this debt program, we arrange for bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries to issue multiple series of investment-grade asset backed net lease mortgage notes, or ABS notes, from time to time as additional collateral is added to the collateral pool and leverage can be added in incremental note issuances based on the value of the collateral pool. 
 The ABS notes are generally issued by our wholly owned special purpose entity subsidiaries to institutional investors through the asset backed securities market. These ABS notes are typically issued in two classes, Class A and Class B. At the time of issuance, the Class A notes generally represent approximately 70 of the appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral owned by the issuing subsidiaries and are currently rated AAA or AA by S P Global Ratings. In April 2024, our consolidated special purpose entities issued Series 2024-1, of net lease mortgage notes under the STORE Master Funding debt program consisting of 450.0 million of notes issued in four Class A tranches as summarized below. No class B notes were issued in connection with this issuance.

Our decision to use either senior unsecured term debt, STORE Master Funding or other non-recourse traditional mortgage loan borrowings depends on our view of the most strategic blend of unsecured versus secured debt that is needed to maintain our targeted level of overall corporate leverage, as well as on borrowing costs, debt terms, debt flexibility and the tenant and industry diversification levels of our real estate assets. Our acquisition of real estate assets will increase our financial flexibility by providing us with additional assets that can support senior unsecured financing or that can serve as substitute collateral for existing debt. Should market factors, which are beyond our control, adversely impact our access to these debt sources at economically feasible rates, our ability to grow through additional real estate acquisitions will be limited to any undistributed amounts available from our operations and equity contributions from our members. 
 For additional details and terms regarding these debt instruments, see Note 4 to the September 30, 2024 unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Equity 
 In connection with the Merger, we issued 1,000 common units to our common members for an aggregate cash amount of 8.3 billion. Prior to the Merger, 125 Series A Preferred Units were issued to our preferred members for an aggregate cash amount of 125,000. In accordance with our operating agreement, our common members receive distributions monthly and are subject to capital calls. Our preferred members receive distributions bi-annually and are not subject to capital calls. 
 Cash Flows 
 Substantially all our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio. As shown in the following table, net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 68.2 million more than the Combined Period. The increase is primarily driven by additional rental revenue and interest income generated by the increase in size of our real estate portfolio and a decrease in cash paid for interest. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our investments in real estate, loans and financing receivables were primarily funded with a combination of capital contributions from our members and net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. Investment activity during the Combined Period in 2023 was primarily funded with a combination of borrowings on our revolving credit facility and capital contributions from our members and also included the impact of the Merger as described above. The acquisition of STORE Capital in the Combined Period was primarily funded with capital contributions from our members and the issuance of the secured term loan facility. 
 From a financing perspective, our activities provided for 101.4 million of net cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 10.8 billion of net cash during the Combined Period. Financing activities in 2024 included 135.0 million of additional term loan borrowings in January 2024, 450.0 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2024-1 notes issued in April 2024 and the prepayment, without penalty, of an aggregate of 186.5 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2018-1 Class A-1 notes and Class A-3 notes. Capital contributions from our members totaled 285.0 million and cash distributions totaled 550.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Combined Period included fundings from the Merger as described above.

As of September 30, 2024, we had liquidity of 327.1 million on our balance sheet. Management believes that our current cash balance, the 378.9 million of immediate borrowing capacity available as of September 30, 2024 on our unsecured revolving credit facility, and the cash generated by our operations is sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months and beyond and allow us to acquire the real estate for which we currently have made commitments. In order to continue growing our real estate portfolio in the future, beyond the excess cash generated by our operations and our ability to borrow, we would expect to raise additional equity capital from our members. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to the September 30, 2024 unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

(a) Change represents the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Combined Period. 

Revenues 
 The increase in revenues period over period was driven primarily by the growth in the size of our real estate investment portfolio, which generated additional rental revenues and interest income. Our real estate investment portfolio grew from approximately 14.7 billion in gross investment amount representing 3,195 properties as of September 30, 2023 to approximately 15.3 billion in gross investment amount representing 3,245 properties at September 30, 2024. Our real estate investments were made throughout the periods presented and were not all outstanding for the entire period; accordingly, a portion of the increase in revenues between periods is related to recognizing revenue for the full periods in 2024 on acquisitions that were made during 2023. Similarly, the full revenue impact of acquisitions made during the first nine months 2024 will not be seen until the fourth quarter of 2024. A smaller component of the increase in revenues between periods is related to rent escalations recognized on our lease contracts; over time, these rent increases can provide a strong source of revenue growth. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we collected 1.1 million and 2.4 million, respectively, of lease termination fees related to certain property sales, which are included in other income. Similarly, other income for the Combined Period included 0.5 million of early termination fees primarily related to certain property sales; we did not recognize any similar revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 5.0 million and 13.0 million, respectively, of bank interest income from cash held on deposit during the period as compared to 0.5 million and 2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the Combined Period, respectively. 
 The majority of our investments are made through sale-leaseback transactions in which we acquire the real estate from the owner-operators and then simultaneously lease the real estate back to them through long-term leases based on the tenant s business needs. The initial rental or capitalization rates we achieve on sale-leaseback transactions, calculated as the initial annualized base rent divided by the purchase price of the properties, vary from transaction to transaction based on many factors, such as the terms of the lease, the property type including the property s real estate fundamentals and the market rents in the area on the various types of properties we target across the United States. There are also online commercial real estate auction marketplaces for real estate transactions; properties acquired through these online marketplaces are sometimes subject to existing leases and offered by third party sellers. In general, because we provide tailored customer lease solutions in sale-leaseback transactions, our lease rates historically have been higher and subject to less short-term market influences than what we have seen in the auction marketplace as a whole. In addition, since our real estate lease contracts are a substitute for both borrowings and equity that our customers would otherwise have 
 35 

to commit to their real estate locations, we believe there is a relationship between lease rates and market interest rates and that lease rates are also influenced by overall capital availability. 
 Interest Expense 
 We fund the growth in our real estate investment portfolio primarily with capital contributions from our members, net proceeds from sales of real estate and net proceeds from issuances of debt. 
 The following table summarizes our interest expense for the periods presented:

Interest expense associated with our secured and unsecured debt decreased from 2023 as a result of a decrease in the weighted average interest rate and partially offset by increase in average outstanding borrowings. Secured and unsecured debt added after September 30, 2023 consisted of 848.6 million of unsecured floating-rate term loans issued from October 2023 to January 2024 which have been effectively converted to a weighted average fixed rate of 5.36 and 450.0 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2024-1 notes issued in April 2024 at a weighted average coupon rate of 5.76 . Secured and unsecured debt repaid in full since September 30, 2023 included the remaining 960.0 million secured, floating rate term loan facility in December 2023 which bore an interest rate of 7.66 for the comparative 2023 periods and an aggregate 186.5 million of STORE Master Funding Series 2018-1 Class A-1 notes and Class A-3 notes which bore a weighted average rate of 4.07 . As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.2 billion of long-term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of just over 4.4 . 
 Interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility decreased from 2023 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average interest rate. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease is also partially attributable to a decrease in the level of average borrowings outstanding as compared to 2023. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the decrease is partially offset by an increased level of average borrowings outstanding as compared to the Combined Period. As of September 30, 2024, we had 375.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
 Property Costs 
 Approximately 99 of our leases are triple net, meaning that our tenants are generally responsible for the property-level operating costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance. Accordingly, we generally do not expect to incur property-level operating costs or capital expenditures, except during any period when one or more of our properties is no longer under lease or when our tenant is unable to meet their lease obligations. Our need to expend capital on our properties is further reduced due to the fact that some of our tenants will periodically refresh the property at their own expense to meet their business needs or in connection with franchisor requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 18 properties that were vacant and not subject to a lease and the lease contracts related to just 7 properties we own are due to expire during the remainder of 2024. We expect to incur some property costs related to 
 36 

the vacant properties until such time as those properties are either leased or sold. The amount of property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into operating ground leases as part of several real estate investment transactions. The ground lease payments made by our tenants directly to the ground lessors are presented on a gross basis in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, both as rental revenues and as property costs. For the few lease contracts where we collect property taxes from our tenants and remit those taxes to governmental authorities, we reflect those payments on a gross basis as both rental revenue and as property costs. 
 The following is a summary of property costs (in thousands):

(a) Property-level operating costs primarily include those expenses associated with vacant or nonperforming properties, property management costs for the few properties that have specific landlord obligations and the cost of performing property site inspections from time to time. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits; professional fees such as portfolio servicing, legal, accounting and rating agency fees; and general office expenses such as insurance, office rent and travel costs. General and administrative costs totaled 17.3 million and 50.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 13.9 million and 42.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the Combined Period, respectively. 
 We expect that general and administrative expenses will rise in some measure as our real estate investment portfolio grows. Certain expenses, such as property related insurance costs and the costs of servicing the properties and loans comprising our real estate portfolio, increase in direct proportion to the increase in the size of the portfolio. However, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of the portfolio have decreased over time due to efficiencies and economies of scale. 
 Merger-related Expenses 
 Merger-related expenses include legal fees and other costs incurred as a result of the Merger. For the period from January 1, 2023 through February 2, 2023, merger-related expenses totaled 0.9 million. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense, which increases in proportion to the increase in the size of our real estate portfolio, rose from 145.7 million and 413.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the Combined Period, respectively, to 146.2 million and 439.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Provisions for Impairment 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 8.7 million and 22.8 million, respectively, in provisions for the impairment of real estate and 2.7 million and 6.0 million, respectively, in provisions for credit losses related to 
 37 

our loans and financing receivables. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the Combined Period, we recognized 5.5 million and 12.1 million, respectively, in provisions for the impairment of real estate and 1.1 million and 6.8 million, respectively, in provisions for credit losses related to our loans and financing receivables. The provisions for credit losses recorded in the Combined Period were recorded as a result of the Merger as required by ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses : Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . 
 Gain (Loss) on Dispositions of Real Estate 
 As part of our ongoing active portfolio management process, we sell properties from time to time in order to enhance the diversity and quality of our real estate portfolio and to take advantage of opportunities to recycle capital. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized a 16.8 million aggregate net gain on the sale of 26 properties. In comparison, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 we recognized a 2.4 million aggregate net loss on the sale of two properties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized a 34.5 million net gain on the sale of 82 properties compared to a 2.5 million aggregate net loss on the sale of 13 properties during the Combined Period. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 1.5 million non-cash net loss and 16.0 million non-cash net gain, respectively, associated with certain lease modifications. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the Combined Period, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 42.2 million associated with the partial prepayments made on the secured term loan facility and unsecured term notes during the period. No such losses were recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023 or during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income was 32.3 million and 84.4 million, respectively, reflecting an increase from net losses of 13.4 million and 62.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the Combined Period, respectively. The change in net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from the growth in our real estate investment portfolio, which generated additional rental revenues and interest income, an increase in gain on disposition of real estate, a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in income tax expense due to a change in the projected effective tax rate as we are no longer subject to income taxes in certain state jurisdictions, offset by increases in impairments and general and administrative expense. The change in net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from the growth in our real estate investment portfolio, which generated additional rental revenues and interest income, an increase in gain on disposition of real estate, and decreases in the loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense, offset by increases in depreciation and amortization, impairments and general and administrative expense.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows. We seek to match the cash inflows from our long term leases with the expected cash outflows on our debt. To achieve this objective, our consolidated subsidiaries primarily borrow on a fixed rate basis for longer term debt issuances. At September 30, 2024, all of our debt carried a fixed interest rate or was effectively converted to a fixed rate for the term of the debt and the weighted average debt maturity was approximately 4.1 years. We are exposed to interest rate risk between the time we enter into a sale leaseback transaction and the time we finance the related real estate with fixed rate debt. In addition, when that debt matures, we may have to refinance the real estate at a higher interest rate. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. 
 We address interest rate risk by employing the following strategies to help insulate us from any adverse impact of rising interest rates: 
 We seek to minimize the time period between acquisition of our real estate and the ultimate financing of that real estate with long term fixed rate debt. 

By using serial issuances of long-term debt, we intend to ladder out our debt maturities to avoid a significant amount of debt maturing during any single period and to minimize the gap between free cash flow and annual debt maturities; free cash flow includes cash from operations less distributions. 

Our secured long term debt generally provides for some amortization of the principal balance over the term of the debt, which serves to reduce the amount of refinancing risk at debt maturity to the extent that we can refinance the reduced debt balance over a revised long-term amortization schedule. 

We seek to maintain a large pool of unencumbered real estate assets to give us the flexibility to choose among various secured and unsecured debt markets when we are seeking to issue new long-term debt. 

We may also use derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury lock agreements, as cash flow hedges to limit our exposure to interest rate movements with respect to various debt instruments. 

See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a more complete discussion of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 our market risk has not changed materially from the amounts reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2024 of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of the Company. 
 39 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including instances in which we are named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of accidents causing personal injuries or other events that occur on the properties operated by our customers. These matters are generally covered by insurance and/or are subject to our right to be indemnified by our customers that we include in our leases. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2024. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not purchase any of our equity securities nor did we sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, other than the preferred and common units issued to our members. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 None. 
 Item 5. Other Information. 
 (a) None. 

(b) None. 

(c) As a result of the Merger, the Company s equity securities are no longer publicly traded, and the Company s officers and directors do not own any Company equity securities. Accordingly, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non- Rule 10b5-1 , as each such term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
