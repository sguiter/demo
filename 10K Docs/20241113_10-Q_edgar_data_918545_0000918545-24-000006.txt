 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 (unaudited)

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of
Baltic International USA, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report filed
with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods
presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would
substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the consolidated financial
statements for fiscal 2023 as reported in the Form 10-K have been omitted.

NOTE 2 - FINANCIAL CONDITION

 We have incurred operating losses since inception. At September 30, 2024,
we had an accumulated deficit of 18,910,015 and current assets and current
liabilities of 2,976 and 4,951,743, respectively, resulting in a working
capital deficit of 4,948,767. Net cash used in operating activities was 0 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0 in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. We currently have limited cash resources available and
have obligations due or past due.

 Management believes that we will be able to achieve a satisfactory level
of liquidity to meets its business plan and capital needs for the next 12
months. Additionally, management believes we have the ability to obtain
additional financing from key officers, directors and certain investors.
Management also believes that we can continue to defer certain amounts payable
by us that are either currently payable or past due. However, there can be no
assurance we will be successful to meet its liquidity needs. There is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3 - LOSS PER COMMON SHARE

 Stock warrants and options are considered to be dilutive for earnings per
share purposes if the average market price during the period exceeds the
exercise price and we had earnings for the period. For the periods ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, all stock warrants and options are considered
anti-dilutive. Supplemental disclosures for loss per share are as follows:

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The following discussions contain forward-looking information. Readers
are cautioned that such information involves risks and uncertainties, including
those created by general market conditions, competition and the possibility of
events may occur which limit our ability to maintain or improve its operating
results or execute its primary growth strategy. Although we believe that the
assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of
the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can therefore be no assurance
that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate.
The inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by
us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.

Current Plan of Operations

 Our current business objective for the next 12 months is to investigate
and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our
principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to
achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather
than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential
candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical
location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.

 We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide us with
positive cash flows. As such, the costs of investigating and analyzing
business combinations for the next approximately 12 months and beyond will be
paid with our current cash on hand and through funds from financing to be
obtained.

 During the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring costs related to filing
of Exchange Act reports and costs relating to consummating an acquisition.

 We believe we will be able to meet these costs with our current cash on
hand and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by
our stockholders or other investors.

 We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a
developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products
or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an
established business which may be experiencing financial or operating
difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a
business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company
which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to
establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other
things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which
may occur in a public offering.

 Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company
or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities
without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be
subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of
financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies.
In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry
characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will
endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there
can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant
risks.

10

We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex
and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid
technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available
capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the
limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of
becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a
publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or
improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained,
providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating
a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key
employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint
ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available
business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various
stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult
and complex.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 We had 2,976 in cash at September 30, 2024, compared to 2,976 at
December 31, 2023.

 At September 30, 2024, we had working capital deficit of 4,948,767 as
compared to 4,811,257 at December 31, 2023. The increase in the working
capital deficit is due primarily to the accrual of additional liabilities.

 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 was 0 as compared to 0 for the same period of 2023.

 We have incurred operating losses since inception. At September 30, 2024,
we had an accumulated deficit of 18,910,015 and current assets and current
liabilities of 2,976 and 4,951,743, respectively, resulting in a working
capital deficit of 4,948,767. We currently have limited cash resources
available and have obligations due or past due.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 There has been no material change in our market risks since the end of the
fiscal year 2023.

11

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating
the effectiveness of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, has concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

 There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or
were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Control

 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all
fraud and material errors. An internal control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, and/or by management's override of
the controls. The design of any system of internal control is also based in
part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in circumstances, and/or the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective internal control system, financial reporting
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely
basis.

1. I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Baltic International
USA, Inc.;

2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

4. As the registrant's sole certifying officer, I am responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:

 a. designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such

 is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
 during the period in which this report is being prepared;

 such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
 our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

 statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
 accounting principles;

 c. evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
 and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
 effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
 of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

 d. disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
 control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's

 the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
 reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
 control over financial reporting; and

5. As the registrant's sole certifying officer, I have disclosed, based on my
most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

 a. all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
 operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
 reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
 record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

 b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
 employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
 controls over financial reporting.
