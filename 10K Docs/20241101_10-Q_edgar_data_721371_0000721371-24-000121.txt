 About Cardinal Health 
 
 Cardinal Health, Inc., an Ohio corporation formed in 1979, is a global healthcare services and products company providing customized solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, pharmacies, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, physician offices, and patients in the home. We provide pharmaceuticals and medical products and cost-effective solutions that enhance supply chain efficiency. We connect patients, providers, payers, pharmacists, and manufacturers for integrated care coordination. 
 We report our financial results in two reportable segments: Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions ("Pharma") segment and Global Medical Products and Distribution ("GMPD") segment. All remaining operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosures are included in Other, which is comprised of Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, at-Home Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics. As used in this report, we, our, us, and similar pronouns refer to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its majority-owned and consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. Our fiscal year ends on June 30. References to fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 and to FY25 and FY24 are to the fiscal years ending or ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (this "Form 10-Q") (including information incorporated by reference) includes "forward-looking statements" addressing expectations, prospects, estimates, and other matters that are dependent upon future events or developments. Many forward-looking statements appear in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A"), but there are others in this Form 10-Q, which may be identified by words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "will," "should," "could," "would," "project," "continue," "likely," and similar expressions, and include statements reflecting future results or guidance, statements of outlook, and expense accruals. These matters are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected, or implied. The most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described in this Form 10-Q, including Exhibit 99.1, and in "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 2024 Form 10-K ). Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q speak only as of the date of this document. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In the "Overview of Consolidated Results" section of MD A, we use financial measures that are derived from our consolidated financial data but are not presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules. The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section following MD A in this Form 10-Q.

MD A Overview 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The discussion and analysis presented below is concerned with material changes in financial condition and results of operations, including amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, between the periods specified in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and in our condensed consolidated statements of earnings/(loss) and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. All comparisons presented are with respect to the prior-year period, unless stated otherwise. Our previously reported segment results have been recast to conform to our new reporting structure and reflect changes in the elimination of inter-segment revenue and allocated corporate technology and shared function expenses, which are driven by the reporting structure change. All of the revisions are reflected throughout this Form 10-Q. See Note 1 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the MD A included in the 2024 Form 10-K.

 Overview of Consolidated Results 
 Revenue 
 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4 percent to 52.3 billion due to the expiration of the OptumRx contracts, partially offset by branded and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers.

 We had GAAP operating earnings of 568 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a GAAP operating loss of 32 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which included the impact of pre-tax goodwill impairment charges related to the GMPD segment of 585 million. 
 Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 12 percent to 625 million from the prior-year quarter primarily due to increased contribution from branded pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical products, which includes the favorable impact from the earlier seasonal launch of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and the performance of our generics program.

 (2) The reconciling items are presented within this table net of tax. See quantification of tax effect of each reconciling item in our GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations in the "Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
 (3) For the three months ended September 30, 2023, GAAP diluted EPS and the EPS impact from the GAAP to non-GAAP per share reconciling items are calculated using a weighted average of 249 million common shares, which excludes potentially dilutive securities from the denominator due to their anti-dilutive effects resulting from our GAAP net loss for the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using a weighted average of 250 million common shares, which includes potentially dilutive shares. 
 (4) For the three months ended September 30, 2023, impairments and (gain)/loss on disposals of assets, net includes a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of 585 million, related to the GMPD segment. For fiscal 2024, the net tax benefit related to this charge was 45 million and was included in the annual effective tax rate. As a result, the tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased approximately by an incremental 102 million, and increased the provision for income taxes during the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, GAAP diluted EPS increased from the prior-year quarter primarily due to the factors impacting GAAP operating earnings/(loss) discussed above. The goodwill impairment charge related to the GMPD segment had a (1.76) per share after-tax impact on GAAP diluted EPS during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 9 percent to 1.88 from the prior-year quarter primarily due to the factors impacting non-GAAP operating earnings discussed above. 
 
 Cash and Equivalents 
 
 Our cash and equivalents balance was 2.9 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.1 billion at June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1.6 billion, which was primarily impacted by the unwinding of the negative net working capital associated with the OptumRx contracts and the normal timing of payments to vendors. Cash used in operating activities for the quarter also includes the impact of our annual payment of 366 million related to the agreement to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by states and local governmental entities (the "National Opioid Settlement Agreement"). In addition, we deployed cash of 375 million for share repurchases and 90 million for capital expenditures.

 Cardinal Health | Q1 Fiscal 2025 Form 10-Q 

MD A Overview 

 Significant Developments in Fiscal 2025 and Trends 
 Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment 
 
 OptumRx Contracts 
 On April 22, 2024, we announced that our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with OptumRx would expire at the end of June 2024. Sales to OptumRx generated 17 percent of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2024; however, due to the class of trade, sales to OptumRx generated a meaningfully lower operating margin than the overall Pharma segment. The expiration of the OptumRx contracts and unwinding of the negative net working capital associated with the contracts adversely impacted our results of operations, including segment profit, financial condition, and cash flows during the three months ended September 30, 2024. While we anticipate offsetting the impact through a combination of onboarding new customers, growth from existing customers, and cost savings, we expect some adverse impacts to continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2025. 
 Acquisitions 
 On September 20, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Integrated Oncology Network ION ), a physician-led independent community oncology network, for a purchase price of 1.1 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. ION includes more than 50 practice sites in 10 states representing more than 100 providers. ION supports a complete continuum of care across its member sites including medical oncology, radiation oncology, urology diagnostic testing, and other ancillary services. The acquisition will build on our Navista oncology practice alliance and is expected to expand our holistic suite of clinical and practice management solutions designed to support independent community oncology practices. This transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. We plan to fund the acquisition with available cash and existing borrowing arrangements. 
 On March 18, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Specialty Networks for a purchase price of 1.2 billion in cash. The acquisition further expands our offerings in key therapeutic areas and accelerates our upstream data and research opportunities with biopharma manufacturers. 
 Branded Pharmaceuticals 
 During fiscal 2024, we saw increased demand for GLP-1 pharmaceuticals, and our sales increased significantly, despite periodic supply shortages. These increased sales positively impacted our Pharma segment and consolidated revenue for the fiscal 2024; however, GLP-1 sales did not meaningfully contribute to segment profit. Future demand for these medications is unpredictable and our ability to meet demand may be impacted by additional supply constraints. 
 During fiscal 2024, we began distributing commercially available COVID-19 vaccines following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approval. Distribution of these vaccines had a greater than anticipated benefit to our Pharma segment profit in fiscal year 2024, especially in the second quarter. We expect COVID-19 vaccine distribution to continue to favorably impact our Pharma segment profit in fiscal 2025, but to a lesser extent than in fiscal 2024. In August 2024, the FDA approved the 2024-2025 commercial COVID-19 vaccines, and our Pharma segment profit was positively impacted by distribution of these vaccines in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Due to the earlier seasonal launch of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution, we expect a lower contribution from the vaccine distribution in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year quarter. 
 Generics Program 
 The performance of our Pharma segment generics program positively impacted the year-over-year comparison of Pharma segment profit during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Pharma segment generics program includes, among other things, the impact of generic pharmaceutical product launches, customer volumes, pricing changes, the Red Oak Sourcing, LLC venture ("Red Oak Sourcing") with CVS Health Corporation ("CVS Health"), and generic pharmaceutical contract manufacturing and sourcing costs. 
 The frequency, timing, magnitude, and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer volumes, pricing changes, customer contract renewals, generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes, and generic pharmaceutical contract manufacturing and sourcing costs all impact Pharma segment profit and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may impact Pharma segment profit and consolidated operating earnings during the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond.

 Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions 
 Pharma segment profit increased 16 percent to 530 million from the prior-year quarter primarily due to increased contribution from branded pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical products, which includes the favorable impact from the earlier seasonal launch of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and the performance of our generics program. This was partially offset by the expiration of the OptumRx contracts. 
 Global Medical Products and Distribution 
 GMPD segment profit decreased to 8 million from the prior-year quarter due to higher manufacturing and health and welfare costs, largely offset by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, which includes the effects of mitigation actions, and growth from existing customers. 
 Other 
 Other profit increased 8 percent to 104 million from the prior-year quarter due to the performance of OptiFreight Logistics. 
 Corporate 
 The changes in Corporate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 are due to the factors discussed in the "Other Components of Consolidated Operating Earnings/(Loss)" section that follows.

MD A Results of Operations 

 Other Components of Consolidated Operating Earnings/(Loss) 
 
 In addition to revenue, gross margin, and SG A expenses discussed previously, consolidated operating earnings/(loss) were impacted by the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Restructuring and employee severance 24 25 Amortization and other acquisition-related costs 74 64 Impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net (1) 541 Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net (40) (41) 
 Restructuring and Employee Severance 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring and employee severance costs were primarily related to the implementation of certain enterprise-wide cost-savings measures and certain initiatives to rationalize our manufacturing operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, restructuring and employee severance costs were primarily related to certain projects resulting from reviews of our strategy, portfolio, capital-allocation framework, and operations and the implementation of certain enterprise-wide cost-savings measures. 
 Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related Costs 
 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was 68 million and 64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Impairments and (Gain)/Loss on Disposal of Assets, Net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a 585 million pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the GMPD segment and recognized a pre-tax gain of 53 million related to the divestiture of the Outcomes business. 
 Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, Net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized income for net recoveries in class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member or plaintiff of 43 million and 41 million, respectively . 
 Earnings Before Income Taxes 
 
 In addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes was impacted by the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Change Other (income)/expense, net (5) 1 N.M. Interest expense, net 32 11 N.M. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net, increased to 32 million from the prior-year quarter primarily due to decreased interest income from cash and equivalents and financial instruments.

MD A Results of Operations 

 Provision for/(Benefit from) Income Taxes 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate was 23.0 percent and 75.1 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior-year quarter was primarily due to the tax effect of the prior-year goodwill impairment charge. See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Tax Effects of Goodwill Impairment Charge 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a 585 million pre-tax charge for goodwill impairment related to the GMPD segment. The net tax benefit related to this charge is 45 million for fiscal 2024. 
 Unless an item is considered discrete because it is unusual or infrequent, the tax impact of the item is included in our estimated annual effective tax rate. When items are recognized through our estimated annual effective tax rate, we apply our estimated annual effective tax rate to the earnings before income taxes for the year-to-date period to compute our impact from income taxes for the current quarter and year-to-date period. The tax impacts of discrete items are recognized in their entirety in the period in which they occur. 
 The tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was included in our estimated annual effective tax rate because it was not considered unusual or infrequent, given that we recorded goodwill impairment in prior fiscal years. The impact of the non-deductible goodwill increased the estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2024. Applying the higher tax rate to pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in recognizing an incremental interim tax benefit of approximately 102 million, which impacted the provision for/(benefit from) income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings/(loss) during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and prepaid expenses and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2023. This interim tax benefit reversed in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2024. 
 Tax Effects of Pillar Two Initiatives 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") published guidance on the establishment of the Pillar Two initiative for a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent. These rules are generally effective for fiscal 2025. We are closely monitoring developments, but we do not currently expect these rules to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.

MD A Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We currently believe that, based on available capital resources and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund our operations and expected future cash needs as described below. If we decide to engage in one or more acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital markets for additional financing. 
 Cash and Equivalents 
 
 Our cash and equivalents balance was 2.9 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.1 billion at June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1.6 billion, which was primarily impacted by the unwinding of the negative net working capital associated with the OptumRx contracts and the normal timing of payments to vendors. Cash used in operating activities for the quarter also includes the impact of our annual payment of 366 million related to the National Opioid Settlement Agreement. In addition, we deployed cash of 375 million for share repurchases and 90 million for capital expenditures. 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. 

Changes in working capital, which impact operating cash flow, can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments, inventory purchases, payments to vendors, and tax payments in the regular course of business, as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix. 
 The cash and equivalents balance at September 30, 2024 included 471 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. 

Other Financing Arrangements and Financial Instruments 
 
 Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper 
 In addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity at September 30, 2024 include a 2.0 billion commercial paper program, backed by a 2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in February 2028. We also have a 1.0 billion committed receivables sales facility through September 2025. At September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility or our committed receivables sales facility. 
 In October 2024, we entered into a new 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, under which we have access to 1.0 billion of committed liquidity through October 2025. We also increased our commercial paper program from 2.0 billion to 3.0 billion. 

Our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facilities require us to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 3.75-to-1. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 We had total long-term obligations, including the current portion and other short-term borrowings, of 5.2 billion and 5.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. We plan to repay our outstanding 3.5 Notes due 2024 at maturity in November 2024 with 400 million of proceeds from the debt issuance in fiscal 2024, 200 million of which were invested in short-term time deposits and classified as prepaid expenses and other in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

MD A Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Capital Deployment 
 
 Opioid Litigation Settlements 
 We had 5.0 billion accrued at September 30, 2024 related to certain opioid litigation, as further described within Note 7 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements." We expect the majority of the remaining payment amounts to occur through 2038. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made our fourth annual payment of 366 million under the National Opioid Settlement Agreement. The amounts of future annual payments may differ from the payments that we have already made. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 90 million and 92 million, respectively. 
 Dividends 
 On each of May 7, 2024 and August 15, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of 0.5056 per share, or 2.02 per share on an annualized basis, which were paid on July 15, 2024 and October 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on July 1, 2024 and October 1, 2024, respectively. 

Share Repurchases 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we deployed 375 million for repurchases of our common shares under an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") program. We funded the repurchases with available cash. This program concluded in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which reduced the amount remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization to approximately 3.1 billion. See Note 11 of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 
 Integrated Oncology Network Acquisition 
 On September 20, 2024, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Integrated Oncology Network, a physician-led independent community oncology network, for a purchase price of 1.1 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals.

MD A Other Items 

Other Items 
 The MD A in the 2024 Form 10-K addresses our contractual obligations and cash requirements, as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Other than the considerations noted above in connection with our proposed acquisition of Integrated Oncology Network, there have been no subsequent material changes outside the ordinary course of business to those items. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis presented below are supplemental disclosures to the critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates specified in our consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2024 . This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates included in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that (i) can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and (ii) require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment. Other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Because estimates are inherently uncertain, actual results may differ, including due to the risks discussed in "Risk Factors" and other risks discussed in the 2024 Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC since June 30, 2024 . 
 Goodwill 
 
 Purchased goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount, which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. Qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value does not exceed the carrying amount, then a quantitative test is performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). 
 Goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including the identification of reporting units, qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, and, if necessary, the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit. Our qualitative evaluation considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified 

events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
 At-Home Solutions Goodwill 
 During our fiscal 2024 annual impairment test, the fair value of our at-Home Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by less than 1 percent. A decrease in future cash flows, an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate, among other things, could result in a goodwill impairment for at-Home Solutions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no indicators of goodwill impairment for the at-Home Solutions reporting unit. 
 Global Medical Products and Distribution Goodwill 
 During fiscal 2024, we recorded 675 million of goodwill impairment charges related to our GMPD reporting unit. GMPD goodwill was fully impaired during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

 Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The "Overview of Consolidated Results" section within MD A in this Form 10-Q contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 In addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and, in some circumstances are more closely correlated to, the performance of our underlying, ongoing business. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a year-over-year basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated. 
 Exclusions from Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the non-GAAP measures presented in this report for its own and for investors assessment of the business for the reasons identified below: 
 LIFO charges and credits are excluded because the factors that drive last-in first-out ("LIFO") inventory charges or credits, such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and year-end inventory levels (which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end), are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted. The exclusion of LIFO charges and credits from non-GAAP metrics facilitates comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies financial results. We did not recognize any LIFO charges or credits during the periods presented. 
 State opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years is the portion of state assessments for prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in periods prior to the period in which the expense is incurred. This portion is excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because it is retrospectively applied to sales in prior fiscal years and inclusion would obscure analysis of the current fiscal year results of our underlying, ongoing business. Additionally, while states' laws may require us to make payments on an ongoing basis, the portion of the assessment related to sales in prior periods are contemplated to be one-time, nonrecurring items. Income from state opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years represents reversals of accruals due to changes in estimates or when the underlying assessments were invalidated by a Court or reimbursed by manufacturers. 
 Shareholder cooperation agreement costs includes costs such as legal, consulting, and other expenses incurred in relation to the agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") entered into among Elliott Associates, L.P., Elliott International, L.P. (together, "Elliott") and Cardinal Health. These include costs incurred to negotiate and finalize the Cooperation Agreement and costs incurred by the Business Review Committee of the Board of Directors formed under this Cooperation Agreement, tasked with undertaking a comprehensive review of our strategy, portfolio, capital-allocation framework, and operations. We have excluded these costs from our non-GAAP metrics because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. 
 Restructuring and employee severance costs are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and include, but are not limited to, costs related to divestitures, closing and consolidating facilities, changing the way we manufacture or distribute our products, moving manufacturing of a product to another location, changes in production or business process outsourcing or insourcing, employee severance, and realigning operations. 
 Amortization and other acquisition-related costs , which include transaction costs, integration costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations, are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies' financial results. Additionally, costs for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets are non-cash amounts, which are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. We also exclude other acquisition-related costs, which are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity s initial

 15 

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

 balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation. These costs are also significantly impacted by the timing, complexity and size of acquisitions. 
 Impairments and gain or loss on disposal of assets, net are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and in the case of impairments, are non-cash amounts, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current, and forecasted financial results. 
 Litigation recoveries or charges, net are excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount. 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions. 
 
 The tax effect for each of the items listed above is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdiction(s) in which the item is recorded. The gross, tax and net impact of each item are presented with our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

 2 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, GAAP diluted EPS and the EPS impact from the GAAP to non-GAAP per share reconciling items are calculated using a weighted average of 249 million common shares, which excludes potentially dilutive securities from the denominator due to their anti-dilutive effects resulting from our GAAP net loss for the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using a weighted average of 250 million common shares, which includes potentially dilutive shares. 
 3 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, impairments and (gain)/loss on disposals of assets, net includes a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of 585 million, related to the GMPD segment. For fiscal 2024, the net tax benefit related to this charge was 45 million and was included in the annual effective tax rate. As a result, the tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased approximately by an incremental 102 million, and increased the provision for income taxes during the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 The sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. 
 We apply varying tax rates depending on the item's nature and tax jurisdiction where it is incurred.

Interest is paid pursuant to the terms of the obligations. These notes are effectively subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables of billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Other Financing Arrangements 
 In addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity at September 30, 2024 include a billion commercial paper program, backed by a billion revolving credit facility, which expires in February 2028. We also have a billion committed receivables sales facility through September 2025. At September 30, 2024, we had amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, or our committed receivables sales facility. 
 In October 2024, we entered into a new 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, under which we have access to billion of committed liquidity through October 2025. We also increased our Commercial Paper program from billion to billion.

 Contingencies 
 New York Opioid Stewardship Act 
 In April 2018, the State of New York passed a budget which included the Opioid Stewardship Act (the "OSA"). The OSA created an aggregate million annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors that was assessed based on each

Notes to Financial Statements 

 billion accrued for these matters, of which million is included in other accrued liabilities and the remainder is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2024, we recognized expense of million 

in connection with opioid-related matters, including agreements in principle with counsel representing classes of third-party payors and acute care hospitals, and settlements with the City of Baltimore and the State of Alabama. This expense was partially offset by a benefit of million related to prepayments at a prenegotiated discount of certain future payments totaling million. 
 Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual, whether as a result of settlement discussions, a judicial decision or verdict or otherwise, but we are not able to estimate a range of reasonably possible additional losses for these matters. We continue to strongly dispute the allegations made in these lawsuits and none of the agreements described below is an admission of liability or wrongdoing. Please see below for additional description of these matters. 
 States Political Subdivisions 
 In 2022, we along with two other national distributors (collectively, the "Distributors") entered into the National Opioid Settlement Agreement to settle the vast majority of opioid lawsuits and claims brought by states and political subdivisions. In addition to the Distributors, parties to the National Opioid Settlement Agreement include states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. Over percent of political subdivisions in settling states (by population as calculated under the National Opioid Settlement Agreement) that had brought opioid-related suits against us have chosen to join the National Opioid Settlement Agreement or have had their claims addressed by state legislation (together with settling states and territories that joined the National Opioid Settlement Agreement, the "Settling Governmental Entities"). 
 During fiscal 2024, we recognized a million charge in litigation (recoveries)/charge, net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings/(loss) related to an agreement with the Alabama Attorney General under which we agreed to pay approximately million to the State of Alabama over a period of ten years to resolve opioid-related claims brought by the State and its political subdivisions (the "Alabama Settlement"). Including the National Opioid Settlement Agreement, the Alabama Settlement and a prior settlement with the State of West Virginia, we have now resolved the opioid-related claims of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Additionally, in August 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement with the City of Baltimore to resolve its opioid-related claims. Under this agreement, we agreed to pay million. 
 Under the National Opioid Settlement Agreement, through October 2024, we have paid the Settling Governmental Entities approximately billion. We expect to pay Settling Governmental Entities additional amounts up to billion

 million over 11-years and million over five years, respectively. 
 Private Plaintiffs 
 The National Opioid Settlement Agreement does not address claims by private parties, which includes unions and other health and welfare funds, hospital systems and other healthcare providers, businesses, and individuals alleging personal injury. There were approximately lawsuits brought by private plaintiffs pending as of October 28, 2024. Of these, are purported class actions. The causes of action asserted by these plaintiffs are similar to those asserted by public plaintiffs. We are vigorously defending ourselves in all of these matters. 
 Following resolution discussions with certain private plaintiffs, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, Distributors finalized agreements with classes of third-party payors and acute care hospitals to settle their claims for million. These agreements remain subject to certain contingencies, including court approval. Active litigation brought by hospital and third-party payor plaintiffs, including certain scheduled trials, has been stayed as to Distributors pending court approval of these settlements. 
 A trial in a case involving plaintiffs began in state court in Georgia in January 2023 and concluded in March 2023 with a verdict for the company and other defendants on all claims. Following cross-appeals, in September 2024, The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the defense verdict in full. 
 Insurance Litigation 
 We are involved in ongoing legal proceedings with insurers related to their obligations to reimburse us for defense and indemnity costs in connection with the lawsuits described above. During fiscal 2024, we received million in insurance recoveries related to these matters and million in the three months ended 

September 30, 2024. We have not recorded a receivable for any additional recoveries related to these insurance litigation matters as of September 30, 2024. Certain recoveries from our insurers are recorded in the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. 
 Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand 
 In November 2023, we received a Civil Investigative Demand ("CID") from the Department of Justice focused on potential violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act in connection with a 2022 transaction in which we purchased a minority ownership interest in a rheumatology managed services organization and a group purchasing organization. We are cooperating with this investigation. 
 Cordis IVC Filter Matters 
 We have been named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits coordinated in Alameda County Superior Court in California involving claims by plaintiffs that allege personal injuries associated with the use of inferior vena cava ("IVC") filter products. These lawsuits sought a variety of remedies, including unspecified monetary damages. The divestiture of the Cordis business did not include product liability related to the IVC filters in the U.S. and Canada, which we retained. 
 In April 2023, we executed a settlement agreement that, if certain conditions are satisfied, will resolve approximately claims for million. This settlement agreement is subject to certain conditions, including certain opt-in thresholds. Between May and September 2023, we made settlement payments totaling million into a qualified settlement fund, which will be disbursed to the plaintiffs if required conditions are satisfied. Since July 2021, while we have also entered into agreements to settle the vast majority of IVC filter product liability claims, these settlements will not resolve all of them, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the remaining lawsuits. 
 We recognized income of million during fiscal year 2023, primarily related to a reduction of the reserve for the estimated settlement and defense costs for these matters due to the execution of the settlements noted above. At September 30, 2024, we had a total of million accrued for losses and legal defense costs, related to the IVC filter product liability lawsuits in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, which includes the million in the qualified settlement fund. 
 Other Civil Litigation 
 Generic Pharmaceutical Pricing Antitrust Litigation 
 In December 2019, pharmaceutical distributors including us were added as defendants in a civil class action lawsuit filed by indirect purchasers of generic drugs, such as hospitals and retail pharmacies. The indirect purchaser case is part of a multidistrict litigation consisting of multiple individual class action matters condensed consolidated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The indirect purchaser plaintiffs allege that pharmaceutical distributors encouraged manufacturers to increase prices, provided

 percent and percent, respectively. The tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the impact of the tax effects of the goodwill impairment charge recognized in the same quarter. 
 Tax Effects of Goodwill Impairment Charge 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a million pre-tax charge for goodwill impairment related to the GMPD segment. The net tax benefit related to this charge is million for fiscal 2024. 
 Unless an item is considered discrete because it is unusual or infrequent, the tax impact of the item is included in our estimated annual effective tax rate. When items are recognized through our estimated annual effective tax rate, we apply our estimated annual effective tax rate to the earnings/(loss) before income taxes for the year-to-date period to compute our impact from income taxes for the current quarter and year-to-date period. The tax impacts of discrete items are recognized in their entirety in the period in which they occur. 
 The tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was included in our estimated annual effective tax rate because it was not considered unusual or infrequent, given that we recorded goodwill impairments in prior fiscal years. The impact of the non-deductible goodwill increased the estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2024. Applying the higher tax rate to pre-tax loss for three months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in recognizing an incremental interim tax benefit of approximately million, which impacted the benefit from income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings/(loss) during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and prepaid expenses and other assets in the condensed 

million and million of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 balances include million and million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would have an impact on the effective tax rate. 
 At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had million and million, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which we recognize in the provision for/(benefit from) from income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings/(loss). These balances are gross amounts before any tax benefits and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 It is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months due to activities of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or other taxing authorities, possible settlement of audit issues, reassessment of existing unrecognized tax benefits, or the expiration of statutes of limitations. We estimate that the range of the possible change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is between and a net decrease of million, exclusive of penalties and interest. 
 Other Tax Matters 
 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years through the current fiscal year.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2023 we entered into pay-floating interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of million. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 We enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity price fluctuations associated with certain forecasted transactions. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
 Pre-tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) were million and immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings were a million loss and a million gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 We hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we enter into cross-currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. 
 In September 2023, we entered into billion million) cross-currency swaps maturing in September 2025 and billion million) cross-currency swaps maturing in June 2027. In June 2024, we terminated the billion million) cross-currency swaps with a maturity date of June 2027. 
 In September 2023, we terminated the billion million) cross-currency swaps entered into in January 2023 and received a net settlement in cash of million, recorded in proceeds from net investment hedge terminations in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are marked to market using the current spot exchange rate as of the end of the period, with gains and losses included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. To the extent the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are not highly effective, changes in carrying value attributable to the change in spot rates are recorded in earnings. 
 Pre-tax gains and losses from net investment hedges recorded in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss were a million loss and a million gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gains recognized in interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings/(loss) for the portion of the net investment hedges excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Economic (Non-Designated) Hedges 
 We enter into foreign currency contracts to manage our foreign exchange exposure related to sales transactions, intercompany financing transactions, and other balance sheet items subject to revaluation that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, these derivative instruments are adjusted to current market value at the end of each period through earnings. The gain or loss recorded on these instruments is substantially offset by the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability. The settlement of the derivative instrument and the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability are both recorded in other (income)/expense, net.

reportable segments: Pharma segment and GMPD segment. All remaining operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosures are included in Other, which is comprised of Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, at-Home Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates performance for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance combined with the nature of the individual business activities. Our previously reported segment results have been recast to conform to this re-aligned reporting structure and reflect changes in the elimination of inter-segment revenue and allocated corporate technology and shared function expenses, which are driven by the reporting structure change. 
 Our Pharma segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and over-the-counter healthcare and consumer products in the United States. This segment also provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers for specialty pharmaceutical products; provides pharmacy management services to hospitals and operates a limited number of pharmacies, including pharmacies in community health centers; and repackages generic pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter healthcare products. 
 Our GMPD segment manufactures, sources, and distributes Cardinal Health brand medical, surgical, and laboratory products, which are sold in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and other markets. In addition to distributing Cardinal Health brand products, this segment also distributes a broad range of medical, surgical, and laboratory products known as national brand products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, and other healthcare providers in the United States and Canada. 
 The remaining non-reportable operating segments included in Other are Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, at-Home Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics. These operating segments respectively operate nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, distribute medical products to patients' homes in the United States, and provide supply chain services and solutions to our customers.

 Segment Profit 
 We evaluate segment performance based on segment profit, among other measures. Segment profit is segment revenue, less segment cost of products sold, less segment distribution, selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses. Segment SG A expenses include share-based compensation expense as well as allocated corporate technology and shared functions expenses, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial and customer care shared services, human resources, information technology, and legal and compliance, including certain litigation defense costs. Corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on headcount, level of benefit provided, and other ratable allocation methodologies. The results attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded within segment profit. 
 We do not allocate the following items to our segments:
