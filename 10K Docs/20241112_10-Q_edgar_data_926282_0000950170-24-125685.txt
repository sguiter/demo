GENERAL Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to ADTRAN, the Company, we , us and our refer to ADTRAN, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the merger of Acorn MergeCo, Inc., a subsidiary of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc., with and into ADTRAN, Inc., on July 8, 2022, after which ADTRAN, Inc. became a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. Merger ), and to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries following the Merger. Furthermore, unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to Adtran Networks refer to Adtran Networks SE (formerly ADVA Optical Networking SE). CAUTIONARY NOTE REG ARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of ADTRAN. ADTRAN and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this report, our other filings with the SEC and other communications with our stockholders. Any statement that does not directly relate to a historical or current fact is a forward-looking statement. Generally, the words believe , expect , intend , estimate , anticipate , would , will , may , might , could , should , can , future , assume , plan , seek , predict , potential , objective , expect , target , project , outlook , forecast and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. We caution you that any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could affect the accuracy of such statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations, as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future, they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. The following are some of the risks that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements: Risks related to our financial results and Company success We are obligated to comply with covenants related to our Wells Fargo Credit Agreement that restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate our debt obligations. 

 We have experienced significant fluctuations in revenue and such fluctuations may continue. Fluctuations in revenue can cause our operating results in a given reporting period to be higher or lower than expected. 

 The lengthy sales and approval process required by Service Providers for new products has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and may result in future revenue fluctuations. 

 We require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, our payment obligations to Adtran Networks shareholders under the DPLTA, and other obligations. 

 We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers or a significant project would significantly reduce our revenue and net income. 

 Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. 

 We expect gross margins to continue to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable. 

 Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, has prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations. 

 We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share. 

 Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes, field service repair obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our liability for warranty obligations may increase or decrease, impacting future cost of revenue. 

 Managing our inventory is complex and has included and may continue to include write downs of excess or obsolete inventory. 

 Our international operations have and may continue to expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. 

 Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel. 

4 

We are exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations in jurisdictions where we transact in local currency, which could harm our financial results and cash flows. 

 We have recognized impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in the past and may be required to do so in the future. 

 We may be unable to successfully and effectively manage and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions, which could harm our operating results, business and prospects. 

 Ongoing inflationary pressures have negatively impacted our revenue and profitability. 

 Risks related to our control environment We have had to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements and, as part of that process, have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 We may face litigation and other risks as a result of the restatements of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

 Breaches of our information systems and cyberattacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to our business and reputation. 

 Risks related to the Business Combination and DPLTA Our ability to realize anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the Business Combination has been and may continue to be affected by a number of factors. 

 We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with the Business Combination and post-closing integration and restructuring efforts. 

 The terms of the DPLTA may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 

 We incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with the Business Combination and DPLTA. Our failure to meet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 We have experienced operational challenges as a result of the Business Combination and may also experience negative synergies and loss of customers. 

 We are exposed to additional litigation risk and uncertainty with respect to the remaining minority shareholders of Adtran Networks, which litigation may require us to pay a higher purchase price for additional Adtran Networks shares than the amount provided for under the DPLTA. 

 Risks related to the telecommunications industry We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology. 

 Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of operations. 

 If our products do not interoperate with our customers networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our business. 

 We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts and which may focus on more leading-edge development. 

 Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards. 

 Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality and commercial value of our products. 

5 

Third party hardware or software that is used with our portfolios may not continue to be available or at commercially reasonable terms. 

 Our use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products. 

 We may incur legal related liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business. 

 If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, Service Providers and enterprise VARs, our revenue may be negatively affected. 

 We depend on a third-party cloud platform provider to host our Mosaic One SaaS network and other operating platforms, and if we were to experience a material disruption or interference in service, our business and reputation could suffer. 

 Risks related to the Company's stock price Our financial performance and operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. 

 The price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly. 

 Risks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences. 

 Changes in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, including the imposition of additional tariffs and the resulting consequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial condition. 

 New or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from tax audits may have an adverse impact on our results. 

 Central banks monetary policy actions and instability in the financial services sector could increase our costs of borrowing money and negatively impact our financial condition and future operations. 

 Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company s business. 

 Further downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, automatic spending cuts or a government shutdown could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition and earnings. 

 The foregoing list of risks is not exclusive. For a more detailed description of the risk factors associated with our business, see Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, as well as the risk factors set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We caution investors that other factors may prove to be important in the future in affecting our operating results. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the impact each factor, or a combination of factors, may have on our business. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because they speak only of our views as of the date that the statements were made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Assuming all the minority holders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate Exit Compensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately million or approximately million, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, and reflecting interest accrued through September 30, 2024 during the pendency of the appraisal proceedings discussed below. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the second option. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on . However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger). 

13 

million (or millio n based on the current exchange rate) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran Networks shareholders as of September 30, 2024 were to elect Exit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general shareholders meeting of Adtran Networks for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of the fiscal year). With respect to the 2023 fiscal year, Adtran Networks ordinary general shareholders meeting occurred on June 28, 2024 and, therefore, the Annual Recurring Compensation was paid on July 3, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued million and million, respectively, in Annual Recurring Compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued million and million, respectively, in Annual Recurring Compensation. The Annual Recurring Compensation is reflected as an increase to retained deficit in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. On October 18, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase additional shares of Adtran Networks through open market purchases not to exceed shares. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately thousand shares and thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in total Exit Compensation payments of approximately million, or approximately million , based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , less than thousand shares and thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in Exit Compensation payments of approximately thousand and million, respectively, or approximately thousand and million, respectively, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2023, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. On July 18, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, and ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent Administrative Agent ), and the other lenders named therein Credit Agreement ), which has since been amended four times. The Company had access to million on its Credit Facility for future borrowings; however, as of September 30, 2024 , the Company was limited to additional borrowings of million based on debt covenant compliance metrics. The financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, as amended, require the Company to maintain a Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of x, a Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of x x to x during a Springing Covenant Period) and a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of x. See Note 11, Revolving Credit Agreements for additional information regarding the terms of the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement and its amendments. As of September 30, 2024, and as of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to meet payment obligations under the DPLTA pertaining to Exit Compensation. While the Company did experience 17.4 million of redemptions in Q3 2024, we believe the probability that more than a small minority of Adtran Networks shareholders elect to receive Exit Compensation in the next twelve months is remote based on the following factors: (i) the diverse base of shareholders that must make this election on an individual shareholder basis, (ii) the fact that the Company expects to receive a procedural decision on a matter of law related to the current ongoing appraisal proceedings involving a dispute over the value of the Exit Compensation in 2024 or early 2025, after which the appeal process should take an additional 24-32 months to resolve, (iii) the current guaranteed Annual Recurring Compensation payment plus the interest earned on such shares during the ongoing appraisal proceedings, and (iv) the current trading value of Adtran Networks shares. The Company experienced revenue declines in the year ended December 31, 2023, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. To the extent the Company does not experience anticipated revenue growth, the Company will implement plans to preserve cash liquidity and maintain compliance with the Company s net leverage covenants. The Company has suspended dividend payments and has implemented a business efficiency program, which includes, but is not limited to ongoing reductions in operating expenses and a site consolidation plan. In connection with the site consolidation plan, the Company is also exploring a potential sale of portions of our headquarters in Huntsville. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in effecting this action on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may need to further reduce capital expenditure and/or take other steps to preserve working capital in order to ensure that we can meet our needs and obligations and maintain compliance with our net leverage debt covenants. In summary, the Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents, investments, working capital management initiatives and availability to access cash under the Wells Fargo credit facility will be adequate to meet our business operating requirements, our capital expenditures and our expected obligations under the DPLTA, including anticipated levels of Exit Compensation and to support our ability to continue to comply with our debt covenants under the Credit Facility, for at least the next twelve months, from the issuance of these financial statements. See Note 11, Revolving Credit Agreements, for additional information regarding the terms of the Amendments of the Wells Fargo Credit agreement.

per share. The Company erroneously accrued this liability every quarter at per share, overstating the associated accrual, the net income attributable to non-controlling interest and the net loss attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. for fiscal periods beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2023 through the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 

 (b) For the periods beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2023 through the quarter ended June 30, 2024 the Company remeasured the redeemable non-controlling interest each quarter-end at the current exchange rate of Euros to U.S. Dollar. The Company treated the redeemable non-controlling interest as a monetary mezzanine equity instrument but should have treated it as a non-monetary mezzanine equity instrument not subject to remeasurement. 

 We have revised our previously issued Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company will revise its previously issued 2023 interim financial statements and 2023 annual financial statements in connection with the future filings of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and interim reporting on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025.

and , respectively. As a result of the effectiveness of the DPLTA on January 16, 2023, the Adtran Networks shares, representing the equity interest in Adtran Networks held by holders other than the Company, can be tendered at any time and are, therefore, redeemable and must be classified outside stockholders equity. Therefore, the permanent equity noncontrolling interest balance was reclassified to redeemable non-controlling interest on January 16, 2023, and was remeasured to fair value based on the trading market price of the Adtran Networks shares. Subsequently, the carrying value of the RNCI is adjusted to its maximum redemption value at each reporting date when the maximum redemption value is greater than the initial carrying amount of the RNCI. For the period of time that the DPLTA is in effect, the RNCI will continue to be presented as RNCI outside of stockholders equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 14 for additional information on RNCI .

 Accounts Receivable The allowance for credit losses was million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to accounts receivable. Receivables Purchase Agreement On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into a receivables purchase agreement (the Factoring Agreement with a third-party financial institution (the Factor ), which accelerates receivable collection and helps to better manage cash flow. Total accounts receivables factored as of the end of September 30, 2024, totaled million of which million was retained pursuant to the Factoring Agreement in the reserve account. The Factoring Agreement provides for up to million in factoring capacity, subject to eligible receivables and reserve requirements, secured by the receivables. The balance in the reserve account is included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of the Factoring Agreement is included in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss and totaled million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

million in borrowing capacity, subject to eligible receivables and reserve requirements, secured by the receivables. The prior factoring agreement qualified for treatment as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810, Consolidations . The receivables purchase agreement was terminated on July 1, 2024 and there were no secured borrowings under this agreement as of September 30, 2024. Total secured borrowings under the agreement were million as of December 31, 2023, which left million available for future borrowings as of December 31, 2023. Accounts receivable pledged as collateral related to the secured borrowings were million as of December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred program fee expenses of million. Contract Assets allowance for credit losses was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to contract assets. Unearned Revenue Of the outstanding unearned revenue balances as of December 31, 2023 , million and million were recognized as revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. Of the million of outstanding unearned revenue balances as of December 31, 2022, million and million were recognized as revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 of pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , to a expense of of pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , and changed from a benefit of of pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , to a benefit of of pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven primarily by non-deductible impairment charges and a loss jurisdiction for which no tax benefits were recognized on its pre-tax losses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company continually reviews the adequacy of its valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had net deferred tax assets totaling million, and a valuation allowance totaling million against those deferred tax assets. Our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets includes the evaluation of historical operating results, as well as the evaluation of evidence which requires significant judgment, including the evaluation of our three-year cumulative income position, future taxable income projections and tax planning strategies. Should management s conclusion change in the future and an additional valuation allowance, or a partial or full release of the valuation allowance becomes necessary, it may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 additional awards will be granted under the Company s previous stock incentive plans, including the 2020 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the 2020 Directors Stock Plan, or the 2015 Employee Stock Incentive Plan. Outstanding awards granted under the Company's prior equity incentive plans will remain subject to the terms of such applicable plans, and shares under such plans that are cancelled or forfeited will be available for issuance under the 2024 Employee Plan or the 2024 Directors Plan, as applicable. Under the 2024 Employee Plan, the Company is authorized to issue million shares of common stock to certain employees, key service providers and advisors through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and restricted stock, any of which may be subject to performance-based conditions. RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2024 Employee Plan will typically vest pursuant to a vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock options granted under the 2024 Employee Plan will typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a contractual term. Stock options, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2024 Employee Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2024 Employee Plan by share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations and expirations of awards granted under the prior employee stock incentive plans increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2024 Employee Plan by share of common stock for each share underlying the award.

million shares of common stock through stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to non-employee directors.

Income generated from marketable equity securities was recorded as interest and dividend income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss. U.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for fair value measurement of financial instruments: Level 1 Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly and Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs could include information supplied by investees.

As of September 30, 2024 

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment on the first day of the fourth quarter. In addition, the Company performs an interim impairment assessment prior to our annual measurement date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (or group of assets) may not be recoverable.

million non-cash impairment charge for goodwill was warranted for the Services Support reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company completed its annual impairment test. There were no significant market changes or changes to cash flow projections, as such no triggering event was identified during the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, qualitative factors such as a decrease in the Company s market capitalization, lower service provider spending and delayed holding patterns of inventory with respect to customers caused us to reduce our forecasts, triggering a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units. The Company determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of an income approach and a market-based peer group analysis. The significant inputs and assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of our reporting units based on future cash flows for the reporting units, requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions related to cash flow projections, discount rate, peer group determination and market multiple selection. The Company determined upon its quantitative impairment assessment to recognize a million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the Network Solutions reporting unit. The quantitative impairment analysis indicated there was no impairment of the Services Support goodwill during the first quarter of 2024. impairment of goodwill was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Goodwill impairment recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was million. Goodwill impairment recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , was million. As of September 30, 2024 , accumulated goodwill impairment losses totaled million. The Company will continue to monitor its stock price, operating results and other macroeconomic factors to determine if there is indication of a decline in fair value requiring an event driven assessment of the recoverability of its remaining goodwill prior to the annual assessment.

million in aggregate principal amount million of which is available to Adtran Networks as borrower pursuant to the Subline (as defined and further described below). On August 9, 2023, ("First Amendment Effective Date") the Company and ADTRAN, Inc. entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement First Amendment ). The First Amendment, among other things, increased the available funding from million to million. In addition, a new million delayed draw term loan facility DDTL was introduced, which (subject to certain conditions) was available for borrowing in the event that at least sixty percent of the outstanding shares of Adtran Networks that were not owned by the Company and its subsidiaries as of the First Amendment Effective Date was tendered (such event, a Springing Covenant Event ). Upon the occurrence of a Springing Covenant Event, the Company will enter a Springing Covenant Period , defined as the fiscal quarter in which a Springing Covenant Event occurs and the three (3) consecutive fiscal quarters thereafter. During the Springing Covenant Period, the Company s leverage ratios are increased. Although the ability to borrow under the DDTL expired on August 9, 2024, the Springing Covenant Event and Springing Covenant Period remain in effect. The First Amendment further added additional financial flexibility by permitting, subject to certain requirements, the incurrence of convertible indebtedness by the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to million. Any such convertible indebtedness must, among other things, be incurred in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement, be unsecured, and otherwise rank junior to borrowings under the Credit Agreement and have a stated maturity date of at least 91 days after the latest scheduled maturity date of loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement. Net cash proceeds from any incurrence of convertible indebtedness must be used to repurchase shares of Adtran Networks or repay revolver borrowings under the Credit Agreement. On January 16, 2024 ("Second Amendment Effective Date"), the Company and ADTRAN, Inc. entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Collateral Agreement ("Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment, among other things, introduced the Covenant Relief Period, which provided the Company with additional covenant headroom while imposing a minimum liquidity financial covenant from the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 to the end of the third quarter of 2024. The Covenant Relief Period ended on November 7, 2024. On March 12, 2024, the Company and ADTRAN, Inc. entered into a Third Amendment to Credit Agreement ("Third Amendment"). The Third Amendment, among other things, amended the definition of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (which is used in the calculation of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) to exclude obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under certain factoring arrangements when calculated for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024. On June 4, 2024, the Company, ADTRAN, Inc., and Adtran Networks entered into a Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement ("Fourth Amendment"). The Fourth Amendment, among other things, created a new sublimit under the existing million revolving commitments, in an aggregate amount of million Subline ), which Subline is available for borrowings by Adtran Networks. Prepayments of outstanding loans under the Subline that result in the remaining outstanding loans under the Subline being less than the German Commitment Reduction Threshold will result in a permanent partial reduction of the commitments in respect of the Subline. The German Commitment Reduction Threshold is initially million and may be lowered from time to time pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment. The existing swing line sublimit and letter of credit sublimit under the Credit Agreement remained available to the US Borrower (and not to Adtran Networks) after giving effect to the Fourth Amendment. Otherwise, the loans under the Subline are subject to substantially the same terms and conditions under the Credit Agreement (including with respect to the interest rate and maturity date) as the other existing revolving commitments. As of September 30, 2024 , ADTRAN, Inc. s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were million, of which approximately million were borrowed by ADTRAN, Inc. and million were borrowed under the Subline by Adtran Networks. The credit facilities provided under the Credit Agreement mature in July 2027, but the U.S. Borrower may request extensions subject to custo mary conditions. In addition, the U.S. Borrower may utilize up to million of the million total revolving facility for the issuance of letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024 , we had a total of million in letters of credit under ADTRAN, Inc. outstanding under the Credit Agreement, leaving a net amount (after giving effect to the million of outstanding borrowings described above) of million available for future borrowings; however, as of September 30, 2024 , the Company was limited to additional borrowings of million based on debt covenant compliance metrics. Any future credit extensions under the Credit Agreement are subject to customary conditions precedent.

for product defects. The Company accrues for warranty returns at the time of product shipment based on its historical return rate and estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. The increasing complexity of the Company's products may cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should the Company's actual experience relative to these factors be worse than its estimates, the Company will record additional warranty expense. The liability for warranty obligations totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

plus a variable component (according to the German Civil Code) that was as of September 30, 2024. Assuming all the minority holders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate Exit Compensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately million or approximately million, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, and reflecting interest accrued through September 30, 2024 , during the pendency of the appraisal proceedings discussed below. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the second option. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on . However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).

million (or million based on the current exchange rate) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran Networks shareholders were to elect Exit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do n ot reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general shareholders meeting of Adtran Networks for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of the fiscal year). With respect to the 2023 fiscal year, Adtran Networks ordinary general shareholders meeting occurred on June 28, 2024 and, therefore, the Annual Recurring Compensation was paid on July 3, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued million and million, r espectively, in Annual Recurring Compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued million and million, r espectively, in Annual Recurring Compensation, which was reflected as an increase to retained deficit. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately thousand shares and thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in total Exit Compensation payments of approximately million, or approximately million , based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, less than thousand shares and thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in Exit Compensation payments of approximately thousand and million, respectively, or approximately thousand and million, respectively, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2023, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. Performance Bonds Certain contracts, customers and jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling million and million, respectively, which expire at various dates through . In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. Purchase Obligations The Company purchases components from a variety of suppliers and uses contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our inventory purchase obligations are for product manufacturing requirements, as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. As of September 30, 2024, purchase obligations totaled mi llion. 
 of the workforce, an early retirement program and a hiring freeze. Additionally, on April 11, 2024, Management determined to close a facility in Greifswald, Germany. The closure of the facility is expected to be completed by December 31, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized million and million of costs related to the Business Efficiency Program, respectively. The costs recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , included total other renegotiated charges and inventory write-down of million as a result of a strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain items in connection with the Business Efficiency Program, of which, million relates to inventory write-downs and million relates to other charges, and are included in cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss. Since the inception of the Business Efficiency Program, we recognized million of costs. We expect costs in the fourth quarter 2024 relating to the 

42 

million and million. Management expects these planned costs to include severance costs to be approximately million in connection with reductions in workforce and site consolidation transaction expenses (primarily brokers fees and Greifswald exit costs) ranging from million to million. The broker fees related to our site consolidation expenses will be netted against proceeds upon the sale of the building(s). Future cash payments include: severance costs and outplacement fees that are anticipated to be million, and payments relating to the site consolidation transaction expenses that are anticipated to be in the range of million to million. We do not anticipate any remaining payments related to the inventory strategy shift. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Business Efficiency Program, including potential impairment charges related to the discontinuance of additional product lines, regulatory requirements related to personnel measures, and site closures. However, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of amounts of such potential incremental charges as of the date of this filing. If required, we will amend this disclosure at such time as management is able in good faith to estimate the amount, or range of amounts, of these charges. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we recognized million and million of restructuring costs relating to the Business Combination under the multi-year integration program and synergy realization that are included in cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Loss, respectively. This included the write down of inventory of million due to a restructuring discontinuation of certain product lines within our Network Solutions segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Adtran Networks is a global provider of network solutions for data, storage, voice and video services. We believe that the combined technology portfolio can best address current and future customer needs for high-speed connectivity from the network core to the end customer, especially upon the convergence of solutions at the network edge. The chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the Company s financial performance based on two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services Support. In addition to operating under two reportable segments, the Company also reports revenue across three categories Subscriber Solutions, Access Aggregation Solutions and Optical Networking Solutions. Our Subscriber Solutions portfolio is used by Service Providers to terminate their access services infrastructure at customers' premises while providing an immersive and interactive experience for residential, business and wholesale subscribers. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services. These solutions include our Mosaic One SaaS applications, fiber termination solutions for residential, business and wholesale subscribers, Wi-Fi access solutions for residential and business subscribers, Ethernet switching and network edge virtualization solutions for business subscribers and cloud software solutions covering a mix of subscriber types. Our Access Aggregation Solutions are solutions that are used by communications Service Providers to connect residential subscribers, business subscribers and mobile radio networks to the Service Providers metro network, primarily through fiber-based connectivity. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services. Our solutions within this category are a mix of fiber access and aggregation platforms, precision network synchronization and timing solutions and access orchestration solutions that ensure highly reliable and efficient network performance. 

 45 

Our Optical Networking Solutions are used by communications Service Providers, internet content providers and large-scale enterprises to securely interconnect metro and regional networks over fiber. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services. Our solutions within this category include open optical terminals, open line systems, optical subsystems and modules, network infrastructure assurance systems and automation platforms that are used to build high-scale, secure and assured optical networks. ADTRAN NETWORKS DOMINATION AND PROFIT AND LOSS TRANSFER AGREEMENT The DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and Adtran Networks, as the controlled company, which was executed on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register Handelsregister of the local court Amtsgericht at the registered seat of Adtran Networks (Jena). Under the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is entitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of Adtran Networks, (ii) Adtran Networks will transfer its annual profit to the Company, subject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net loss incurred by Adtran Networks. The obligation of the Company to absorb Adtran Networks annual net loss applied for the first time to the loss generated in 2023. Additionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides that Adtran Networks shareholders (other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their Adtran Networks shares to the Company in exchange for compensation in cash of 17.21 per share plus guaranteed interest ("Exit Compensation"), or (ii) to remain Adtran Networks shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of 0.52 per share for each full fiscal year of Adtran Networks Annual Recurring Compensation ). The guaranteed interest component under the Exit Compensation is calculated from the effective date of the DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring Compensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0 plus a variable component that was 3.37 as of September 30, 2024. The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general shareholders meeting of Adtran Networks for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of the fiscal year). With respect to the 2023 fiscal year, Adtran Networks ordinary general shareholders meeting occurred on June 28, 2024, and, therefore, the Annual Recurring Compensation was paid on July 3, 2024. The adequacy of both forms of compensation has been challenged by minority shareholders of Adtran Networks via court-led appraisal proceedings under German law, and it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case, including interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act Aktiengesetz and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette Bundesanzeiger ). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 830 thousand shares and 831 thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in total Exit Compensation payments of approximately 15.7 million, or approximately 17.4 million, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, less than 1 thousand shares and 64 thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in Exit Compensation payments of approximately 8 thousand and 1.1 million, respectively, or approximately 9 thousand and 1.2 million, respectively, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2023, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents and the credit facility, we may fund a portion or all of the Exit Compensation through the sale of securities or additional alternative funding sources, if available. There can be no assurances that we would be successful in effecting these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds as needed, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and financial condition. We currently hold 34,855,921 no-par value bearer shares of Adtran Networks, representing 67.0 of Adtran Networks outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024. The foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a non-binding English translation of which incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.7 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. Business Efficiency Program On November 6, 2023, due to the uncertainty around the current macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer spending levels, the Company s management decided to implement a business efficiency program Business Efficiency Program targeting the reduction of ongoing operating expenses and focusing on capital efficiency inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early retirement program, a site consolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the potential sale of portions of our headquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension of the quarterly dividend. The Business Efficiency Program expands upon other recently implemented restructuring efforts and synergy costs following the Business Combination. For instance, on August 17, 2023, the Company s management determined to discontinue its copper-based Digital 

 46 

Subscriber Line broadband access technology products and its fixed wireless access products in its Network Solutions segment. Furthermore, on September 29, 2023, the Company s management decided to exit the "IoT" gateway market (indoor and outdoor), a subset of the broader IoT market (together with the other product discontinuations, the Discontinuations ). On October 25, 2023, all employees were informed of certain personnel measures, which included the reduction of salary for select management, a reduction of approximately 5 of the workforce, an early retirement program and a hiring freeze. Additionally, on April 11, 2024, management determined to close a facility in Greifswald, Germany. The closure of the facility is expected to be completed by December 31, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 5.9 million and 40.6 million of costs related to the Business Efficiency Program, respectively. The costs recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included charges of 8.6 million as a result of a strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain items in connection with the Business Efficiency Program, of which, 4.1 million relates to inventory write-downs and 4.5 million relates to other charges, and are included in cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss. Since the inception of the Business Efficiency Program, we recognized 65.6 million of costs. We expect costs in the fourth quarter 2024 relating to the Business Efficiency Program to range between 9.6 million and 13.8 million. Management expects these planned costs to include severance costs to be approximately 6.2 million in connection with reductions in workforce and site consolidation transaction expenses (primarily brokers fees and Greifswald exit costs) ranging from 3.4 million to 7.6 million. The broker fees related to our site consolidation expenses will be netted against proceeds upon the sale of the building(s). Future cash payments include: severance costs and outplacement fees that are anticipated to be approximately 23.1 million, and payments relating to the site consolidation transaction expenses that are anticipated to be in the range of 3.4 million to 7.6 million, We do not anticipate any remaining payments related to the inventory strategy shift. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Business Efficiency Program, including potential impairment charges related to the discontinuance of additional product lines, regulatory requirements related to personnel measures, and site closures. However, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of amounts of such potential incremental charges as of the date of this filing. If required, we will amend this disclosure at such time as management is able in good faith to estimate the amount, or range of amounts, of these charges. Business Combination Integration Costs During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 0.4 million and 1.4 million of integration costs related to the Business Combination were incurred. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 1.7 million and 3.1 million of integration costs related to the Business Combination were incurred, respectively. These transaction costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, research development expenses and cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Loss. We expect to incur additional integration costs and expenses associated with the implementation of the DPLTA throughout 2024 and such costs are expected to be material. See Note 19 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS We ended the third quarter of 2024 with a year-over-year revenue decrease of 16.4 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by decreased volume of sales activity due to customers' focus on reducing inventory levels and continuing uncertain macroeconomic conditions related to inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates and currency fluctuation which impacted the spending behavior of our customers. During the third quarter of 2024, we had one customer with revenues greater than 10.0 which was an international Service Provider customer and our five largest customers comprised 30.1 of our revenue. Our year-over-year domestic revenue decreased by 8.0 and continued to be impacted by elevated customer inventory levels, continuing effects of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and decreased shipments to distributor customers. Internationally, our year-over-year revenue decreased by 22.2 , primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on revenue as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar and decreased shipments to network operators in Europe. Access Aggregation and Optical Networking revenue categories experienced a general slowdown in revenue as a result of reduced spending by our Service Provider customers as they continue to reduce excess inventory levels and monitor the uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Despite these challenges, we have maintained our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. For example, we expect public funding through projects such as IPCEI ME/CT to further our research and development for new communication technologies. Additionally, public funding through the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program is expected to commence in 2025, which provides a positive outlook for the future. In Europe, we continue to see increased activity from high-risk vendor replacement and broadband subsidy programs. Our operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to several factors, including customer order activity, prior supply chain constraints, component availability, and the Company's consolidation and integration with Adtran Networks. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days, requiring us to maintain higher inventory levels. These factors may result in limited order flow visibility. We have taken decisive steps to transform our business into a leaner, more efficient and more profitable company, including through the implementation of a Business Efficiency Program, which includes a significant cost efficiency program targeting a reduction of ongoing operating expenses and a capital efficiency program inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early retirement program, a site consolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the potential sale of portions of our headquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension 

 47 

of the quarterly dividend. Nevertheless, our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues has and may again in the future significantly impact on our financial results in any given quarter. Our operating results have significantly fluctuated and may do so in the future as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, inflation, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs, tariffs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. In recent years, inflationary pressures on input costs, such as raw materials and labor, and distribution costs had a negative impact on our operating results. However, inflationary pressures on our supply chain have eased somewhat, which has led to reductions in cost premiums on raw material costs and freight. We continue to support our customer demand for our products by working with our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors and customers to address and to limit the disruption to our operations and order fulfillment. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an additional adverse effect on our business and operating results beyond the effects of the most recent inventory write-downs. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to ensure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results. We are exposed to changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchanges rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period s currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with the euro and the British pound. As a result of our global operations, our revenue, gross margin, operating expense and operating loss in some international markets has been and may continue to be affected by foreign currency fluctuations. The Company s policy is to assess the realizability of assets (long-lived assets, intangibles and goodwill) held within our reporting units and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company identified a triggering event due to a decrease in its market capitalization and changes in projections (decrease in estimated cash flows). While the quantitative impairment analysis indicated that there was no impairment of Network Solutions goodwill, the Company determined a 37.9 million non-cash impairment charge for goodwill was warranted for the Services Support reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company completed its annual impairment test. There were no significant market changes or changes to cash flow projections, as such no triggering event was identified during the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, qualitative factors such as a decrease in the Company s market capitalization, lower service provider spending and delayed holding patterns of inventory with respect to customers caused us to reduce our forecasts, triggering a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units. The Company determined the fair value of the Network Solutions reporting unit using a combination of an income approach and a market-based peer group analysis. The Company determined upon its quantitative impairment assessment to recognize a 292.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the Network Solutions reporting unit during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The quantitative impairment analysis indicated there was no impairment of the Services Support goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2024. There have been no triggering events identified affecting the valuation of goodwill in our Services Support reporting unit during the second and third quarters of 2024. Our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. Factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results are included in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q.

REVENUE Our revenue decreased 16.4 from 272.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 227.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 26.4 from 923.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 679.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily driven by a decrease in volume of sales activity due to customers focus on reducing inventory levels and the completion of significant customer projects. The decrease in revenue by category for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to a 45.7 million decrease in Optical Networking Solutions products, and a 27.6 million decrease in Access Aggregation revenue partially offset by a 28.6 million increase in Subscriber Solutions products. The decrease in revenue by category for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to a 187.6 million decrease in Optical Networking Solutions products, and a 75.9 million decrease in Access Aggregation revenue partially offset by a 19.8 million increase in Subscriber Solutions products. Continued customer concerns over inventory stocking levels have affected our revenue year-to-date in our Optical Networking Solutions category, Access Aggregation category and our Subscriber Solutions category. This includes our two largest Optical Networking Solutions customers, which we believe are focused on reducing existing inventory. Network Solutions segment revenue decreased 20.6 from 228.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 181.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 31.7 from 794.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 542.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in Network Solutions revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a decrease of 47.1 million in volume of sales activity in Optical Networking products, and a decrease of 28.1 million in volume of sales activity in Access Aggregation products partially offset by an increase of 28.1 million in volume of sales activity in Subscriber Solutions products. The decrease in Network Solutions revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a decrease of 190.3 million in volume of sales activity in Optical Networking products, and a decrease of 80.0 million in volume of sales activity in Access Aggregation products partially offset by an increase of 18.3 million in volume of sales activity in Subscriber Solutions products. Services Support segment revenue increased 5.6 from 43.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 46.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 6.4 from 129.6 million for the nine months ended 

 49 

September 30, 2023, to 137.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable a 1.5 million increase in Optical Networking services, a 0.5 million increase for Subscriber Solutions and a 0.5 million increase in Access Aggregation. The increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable a 4.1 million increase in Access Aggregation a 2.7 million increase in Optical Networking services, and a 1.5 million increase in Subscriber Solutions services. More specifically, the increase in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of our ADTRAN, Inc. operations was primarily due to higher volume of sales of our software services and business solutions services. Domestic revenue decreased by 8.0 from 111.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 102.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased by 21.8 from 375.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 293.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in domestic revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to lower volume of sales of our residential solutions products as a result of customers focus on reducing inventory levels across all revenue categories. International revenue, which is defined as revenue generated from the Network Solutions and Services Support segments provided to a customer outside of the U.S., decreased by 22.1 from 160.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 125.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased by 29.5 from 548.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 386.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. International revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased from 59.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 55.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased from 59.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 56.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in international revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the conclusion of specific customer projects and customer concerns over inventory stocking levels. While international revenue has decreased to approximately 55.0 and 56.8 of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, the mix of our Network Solutions and Services Support segments as a percentage of total international revenue remains relatively linear. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our net revenue by approximately 2.8 million and increased our net revenue by approximately 4.7 million, respectively. Our ADTRAN, Inc. international revenue is largely focused on broadband infrastructure and is consequently affected by the decisions of our customers as to timing for installation of new technologies, expansion of their networks and/or network upgrades. Our international customers must make these decisions in the regulatory and political environment in which they operate both nationally and, in some instances, regionally whether of a multi-country region or a more local region within a country. Consequently, while we expect the global trend towards deployment of more robust broadband speeds and access to continue creating additional market opportunities for us, the factors described above have resulted in and may continue to result in pressure on revenue and operating income. Our Adtran Networks international revenue is largely focused on the manufacture and selling of networking solutions that are based on three core areas of expertise: fiber-optic transmission technology (cloud interconnect), cloud access technology for rapid creation of innovative services around the network edge and solutions for precise timing and synchronization of networks. In addition, Adtran Networks international operations offers a comprehensive portfolio of network design, implementation and maintenance services to assist operators in the deployment of market-leading networks while reducing costs to maintain these networks. COST OF REVENUE As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased from 72.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 62.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased from 72.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 64.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 0.7 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to decreased amortization of intangible backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, a 0.8 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to decreased acquisition costs, a 9.5 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue in connection with our Business Efficiency Program (primarily a decrease in inventory write-offs related to our strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines), partially offset by a 0.8 increase in expense as a percentage of revenue attributable to changes in customer and product mix. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 3.5 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to decreased amortization of intangible backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, a 3.7 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to decreased acquisition costs, a 1.1 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue in connection with our Business Efficiency Program (primarily a decrease in inventory write-offs related to our strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines, partially offset by increases in severance and employee related costs), partially offset by a 0.7 increase in expense as a percentage of revenue attributable to changes in customer and product mix. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our cost of revenue by approximately 0.6 million and increased our cost of revenue by approximately 1.0 million, respectively. Network Solutions cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment s revenue, decreased from 79.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 69.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased from 77.8 for the nine months ended 

 50 

September 30, 2023 to 71.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 0.8 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to decreased amortization of intangible backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, a 1.0 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to decreased acquisition costs, and a 11.9 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue in connection with our Business Efficiency Program (primarily a decrease in inventory write-offs related to our strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines), partially offset by a 3.7 increase in expense as a percentage of revenue attributable to changes in customer and product mix. The decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 4.4 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to decreased amortization of intangible backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, a 4.6 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to decreased acquisition costs, a 1.8 decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue in connection with our Business Efficiency Program (primarily a decrease in inventory write-offs related to our strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines, partially offset by increases in severance and employee related costs), which resulted in an inventory write down and other charges of 8.6 million incurred as a result of a strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines, partially offset by a 4.1 increase in expense as a percentage of revenue attributable to changes in customer and product mix. Services Support cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment s revenue, decreased from 38.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 36.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased from 39.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 40.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to changes in customer and product mix. Services Support revenue is comprised of network planning and implementation, maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, with network planning and implementation being the largest and fastest growing component in the long-term. Compared to our other services, such as maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, our network planning and implementation services typically utilize a higher percentage of internal and subcontracted engineers, professionals and contractors to perform the work for customers. The additional costs incurred to perform these infrastructure and labor-intensive services inherently result in lower average gross margins as compared to maintenance and support services. Within the Services Support segment, we do expect variability in gross margins from quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of the services recognized. GROSS PROFIT As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased from 27.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 37.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased from 27.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 35.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 0.7 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue related to decreased amortization of intangible backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, a 0.8 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue related to decreased acquisition costs, a 9.5 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in connection with decreased expenses with our Business Efficiency Program (primarily a decrease in inventory write-offs related to our strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines), partially offset by a 0.8 decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue attributable to changes in customer and product mix. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 3.5 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue related to decreased amortization of intangible backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, a 3.7 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue related to decreased acquisition costs, a 1.1 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in connection with decreased expenses with our Business Efficiency Program (primarily a decrease in inventory write-offs related to our strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines, partially offset by increases in severance and employee related costs), which resulted in an inventory write down and other charges of 8.6 million incurred as a result of a strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines, partially offset by a 0.7 decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue attributable to changes in customer and product mix. As a percentage of that segment's revenue, Network Solutions gross profit increased from 20.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 30.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased from 22.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 28.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 0.8 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue related to decreased amortization of intangible backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks a 1.0 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue related to decreased acquisition costs, a 11.9 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in connection with decreased expenses with our Business Efficiency Program (primarily a decrease in inventory write-offs related to our strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines), partially offset by a 3.7 decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue attributable to changes in customer and product mix. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a 4.4 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue related to decreased amortization of intangible backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, a 4.6 increase in gross profit as a percentage 

 51 

of revenue related to decreased acquisition costs, a 1.8 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in connection with decreased expenses with our Business Efficiency Program (primarily a decrease in inventory write-offs related to our strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines, partially offset by increases in severance and employee related costs), which resulted in an inventory write down and other charges of 8.6 million incurred as a result of a strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain product lines, partially offset by a 4.1 decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue attributable to changes in customer and product mix. As a percentage of that segment's revenue, Services Support gross profit increased from 61.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 63.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased from 60.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 59.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in customer and services mix. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 23.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 25.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased from 21.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 25.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will generally fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared. We are still in the process of implementing our Business Efficiency Program, which we expect will lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue over time. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 8.4 from 62.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 57.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 10.5 from 196.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 176.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for management, accounting, information technology, human resources, sales and marketing, as well as independent auditor, tax and other professional fees, contract services and legal and litigation related costs. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to the impact of the Company's Business Efficiency Program and integration programs. Specifically, the Company reduced its employee-related costs by 3.4 million. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to the impact of the Company's Business Efficiency Program and integration programs. Specifically, the Company reduced its employee-related costs by 17.0 million, and travel expenses by 2.0 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S dollar decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 0.3 million and increased our selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 0.6 million, respectively. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased from 23.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 22.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased from 22.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 25.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will generally fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared. We are still in the process of implementing our Business Efficiency Program, which we expect will lower research and development expense as a percentage of revenue over time. Research and development expenses decreased 17.8 from 62.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 51.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 15.3 from 203.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 172.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the impact of the Company's Business Efficiency Program and integration programs. Specifically, the Company reduced its employee-related costs by 5.6 million and contract services by 2.5 million. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the impact of the Company's Business Efficiency Program and integration programs. Specifically, the Company reduced its employee-related costs by 11.5 million and contract services by 6.7 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our research and development expenses by approximately 0.5 million and increased our research and development expenses by approximately 1.4 million, respectively. Adtran Networks has arrangements with governmental entities for the purpose of obtaining funding for research and development activities. The Company classifies government grants received under these arrangements as a reduction to research and development expenses incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized 2.5 million and 0.8 million as a reduction of research and development expense, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized 6.6 million and 2.3 million as a reduction of research and development expense, respectively. 

 52 

We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in significant research and product development efforts, which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenue from a major new product group. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT No goodwill impairment was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, qualitative factors such as a decrease in the Company s market capitalization, cautious service provider spending due to economic uncertainty and continued customer focus on inventory adjustments, triggered a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units. The Company determined upon its quantitative impairment assessment to recognize a 292.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the Network Solutions reporting unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2023, qualitative factors, such as a decrease in the Company's market capitalization and long-term projections, triggered a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units. The Company determined upon its quantitative impairment assessment to recognize a 37.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the Services Support reporting unit. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges for the Network Solutions reporting unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For additional information, see Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME Interest and dividend income increased from 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased from 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest and dividend income is primarily attributable to fluctuations in investment balances and an increase in the rate of return on those investments due to interest rate movements. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased from 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased from 11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by higher amortization of debt issuance costs, as well as higher interest rates associated with the amendments of the Credit Agreement and higher average borrowings outstanding versus the three and nine months ending September 30, 2023. See Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. NET INVESTMENT GAIN (LOSS) We recognized a net investment loss of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a net investment gain 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and recognized a net investment gain of 1.1 million and 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively. The fluctuations in our net investments were primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of our securities recognized during the period. We expect that any future market volatility could result in continued fluctuations in our investment portfolio. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, and Investing Activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information. OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET Other (expense) income, net, which primarily consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and income from excess material sales, decreased from income of 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to expense of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased from income of 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to expense of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT The Company's effective tax rate changed from a benefit of 18.0 of pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to a expense of 1.4 of pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and changed from a benefit of 19.2 of pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to a benefit of 3.9 of pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The changes in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were driven primarily by non-deductible impairment charges and a loss jurisdiction for which no tax benefits were recognized on its pre-tax losses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

 53 

NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADTRAN HOLDINGS, INC. As a result of the above factors, net loss attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. decreased from net loss of 78.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to a net loss of 31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased from net loss of 156.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to a net loss of 405.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have historically financed our ongoing business with existing cash, investments and cash flow from operations; however, we have increasingly relied upon our credit arrangements to manage our working capital needs. We had a positive cash flow from operating activities of 88.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We have used, and expect to continue to use, existing cash, investments, credit arrangements and cash generated from operations for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products, expand our sales and marketing activities and fund capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, our cash on hand was 88.5 million of which 62.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Company had access to 205.6 million on its Credit Facility for future borrowings; however, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was limited to additional borrowings of 24.1 million based on debt covenant compliance metrics. Generally, we intend to permanently reinvest funds held outside the U.S., except to the extent that any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax. As of December 31, 2023, our cash on hand was 87.2 million, of which 73.0 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either (1) to remain an Adtran Networks shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit Compensation plus guaranteed interest. The guaranteed interest under the Exit Compensation is calculated from the effective date of the DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring Compensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0 plus a variable component (according to the German Civil Code) that was 3.37 as of September 30, 2024. Assuming all the minority holders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate Exit Compensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately 326.9 million or approximately 364.1 million, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, and reflecting interest accrued through September 30, 2024, during the pendency of the appraisal proceedings discussed below. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the second option. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act Aktiengesetz and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette Bundesanzeiger ). We are also obligated to absorb any annual net loss of Adtran Networks under the DPLTA. Additionally, our obligation to pay Annual Recurring Compensation under the DPLTA is a continuing payment obligation, which will amount to approximately 8.9 million or 10.0 million (based on the current exchange rate) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran Networks shareholders were to elect Exit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general shareholders meeting of Adtran Networks for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of the fiscal year). With respect to the 2023 fiscal year, Adtran Networks ordinary general shareholders meeting occurred on June 28, 2024; therefore, the Annual Recurring Compensation was paid on July 3, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 2.4 million and 2.6 million, respectively, in Annual Recurring Compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 7.4 million and 7.6 million, respectively, in Annual Recurring Compensation which is reflected as an increase to retained deficit. On July 18, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, and ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent Administrative Agent ), and the other lenders named therein Credit Agreement ), which has since been amended four times. The Company had access to 205.6 million on its Credit Facility for future borrowings; however, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was limited to additional borrowings of 24.1 million based on debt covenant compliance metrics. The financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, as amended, require the Company to maintain a Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of 5.00x, a Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of 3.25x (or 4.0x to 3.5x during a Springing Covenant Period), and a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25x. See Note 11, Revolving Credit Agreements for additional information regarding the terms of the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement and its amendments. As of September 30, 2024, and as of the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to meet payment obligations under the DPLTA pertaining to Exit Compensation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 830 thousand shares and 831 thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in total Exit Compensation payments of approximately 15.7 million, or approximately 17.4 million, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, being paid to Adtran 

 54 

Networks shareholders. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, less than 1 thousand shares and 64 thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in Exit Compensation payments of approximately 8 thousand and 1.1 million, respectively, or approximately 9 thousand and 1.2 million, respectively, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2023, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. As of September 30, 2024, and as of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to meet payment obligations under the DPTLA pertaining to Exit Compensation. While the Company did experience 17.4 million of redemptions in Q3 2024, we believe the probability that more than a small minority of Adtran Networks shareholders elect to receive Exit Compensation in the next twelve months is remote based on the following factors: (i) the diverse base of shareholders that must make this election on an individual shareholder basis, (ii) the fact that the Company expects to receive a procedural decision as a matter of law related to the current ongoing appraisal proceedings involving a dispute over the value of the Exit Compensation in 2024 or early 2025, after which the appeal process should take an additional 24-32 months to resolve, (iii) the current guaranteed Annual Recurring Compensation payment plus the interest earned on such shares during the ongoing appraisal proceedings, and (iv) the current trading value of Adtran Networks shares. The Company experienced revenue declines in the year ended December 31, 2023, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. To the extent that the Company is further impacted by customers' inventory reduction initiatives and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, the Company is implementing plans to preserve cash liquidity and maintain compliance with the Company s covenants. The Company has suspended dividend payments and is continuing to implement a Business Efficiency Program, which includes, but is not limited to ongoing reductions in operating expenses and a site consolidation plan. In connection with the site consolidation plan, the Company is also exploring a potential sale of portions of our headquarters in Huntsville. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in effecting this action on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may need to further reduce capital expenditure and/or take other steps to preserve working capital in order to ensure that we can meet our needs and obligations and maintain compliance with our debt covenants. In summary, the Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents, investments, working capital management initiatives and availability to access cash under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility (described below), will be adequate to meet our business operating requirements, our capital expenditures and our expected obligations under the DPLTA, including anticipated levels of Exit Compensation and ability to continue to comply with our debt covenants under the Credit Facility for at least the next twelve months, from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. See Note 11, Revolving Credit Agreements, for additional information regarding the terms of the Amendments of the Wells Fargo Credit agreement and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item, 1 for additional information regarding the terms of the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, as amended. Wells Fargo Credit Facility On July 18, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower ("US Borrower"), and the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent Administrative Agent ), and the other lenders named therein (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement ). As of the date of this filing, the Credit Agreement allows for revolving credit borrowings of up to 400.0 million in aggregate principal amount 100.0 million of which is available to Adtran Networks as borrower pursuant to the Subline (as defined and further described below), as well as the 50.0 million delayed draw term loan facility described below. The term of the delayed draw term loan facility expired on August 9, 2024. On August 9, 2023, ("First Amendment Effective Date") the Company and ADTRAN, Inc. entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement First Amendment ). The First Amendment, among other things, increased the available funding from 100.0 million to 400.0 million. In addition, a new 50.0 million delayed draw term loan facility DDTL was introduced, which (subject to certain conditions) was available for borrowing in the event that at least sixty percent (60.0 of the outstanding shares of Adtran Networks that were not owned by the Company and its subsidiaries as of the First Amendment Effective Date was tendered (such event, a Springing Covenant Event ). Upon the occurrence of a Springing Covenant Event, the Company will enter a Springing Covenant Period , defined as the fiscal quarter in which a Springing Covenant Event occurs and the three (3) consecutive fiscal quarters thereafter. During the Springing Covenant Period, the Company s leverage ratios are increased. Although the ability to borrow under the DDTL expired on August 9, 2024, the Springing Covenant Event and Springing Covenant Period remain in effect. The First Amendment further added additional financial flexibility by permitting, subject to certain requirements, the incurrence of convertible indebtedness by the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to 172.5 million. Any such convertible indebtedness must, among other things, be incurred in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement, be unsecured, and otherwise rank junior to borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and have a stated maturity date of at least 91 days after the latest scheduled maturity date of loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement. Net cash proceeds from any incurrence of convertible indebtedness must be used to repurchase shares of Adtran Networks or repay revolver borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 

 55 

On January 16, 2024 ("Second Amendment Effective Date"), the Company and ADTRAN, Inc. entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Collateral Agreement ("Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment, among other things, introduced the Covenant Relief Period, which provided the Company with additional covenant headroom while imposing a minimum liquidity financial covenant from the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 to the end of the third quarter of 2024. The Covenant Relief Period ended on November 7, 2024. On March 12, 2024, the Company and ADTRAN, Inc. entered into a Third Amendment to Credit Agreement ("Third Amendment"). The Third Amendment, among other things, amended the definition of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (which is used in the calculation of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) to exclude obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under certain factoring arrangements when calculated for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024. On June 4, 2024, the Company, ADTRAN, Inc., and Adtran Networks entered into a Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement ("Fourth Amendment"). The Fourth Amendment, among other things, created a new sublimit under the existing 400.0 million revolving commitments, in an aggregate amount of 100.0 million Subline ), which Subline is available for borrowings by Adtran Networks. Prepayments of outstanding loans under the Subline that result in the remaining outstanding loans under the Subline being less than the German Commitment Reduction Threshold will result in a permanent partial reduction of the commitments in respect of the Subline. The German Commitment Reduction Threshold is initially 75.0 million and may be lowered from time to time pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment. The existing swing line sublimit and letter of credit sublimit under the Credit Agreement remained available to the US Borrower (and not to Adtran Networks) after giving effect to the Fourth Amendment. Otherwise, the loans under the Subline are subject to substantially the same terms and conditions under the Credit Agreement (including with respect to the interest rate and maturity date) as the other existing revolving commitments. As of September 30, 2024, ADTRAN, Inc. s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were 189.8 million, of which approximately 115.0 million were borrowed by ADTRAN, Inc. and 75.0 million were borrowed under the Subline by Adtran Networks. The credit facilities provided under the Credit Agreement mature in July 2027, but the US Borrower may request extensions subject to customary conditions. In addition, the US Borrower may utilize up to 50.0 million of the 400.0 million total revolving facility for the issuance of letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 4.4 million in letters of credit under ADTRAN, Inc. outstanding under the Credit Agreement, leaving a net amount (after giving effect to the 189.8 million of outstanding borrowings described above) of 205.6 million available for future borrowings; however, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was limited to additional borrowings of 24.1 million based on debt covenant compliance metrics. Any future credit extensions under the Credit Agreement are subject to customary conditions precedent. The proceeds of any loans are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and to pay a portion of the Exchange Offer consideration. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. Revolving Line of Credit Interest Rate All U.S. dollar borrowings under the revolving line of credit other than swingline loans, which bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined below plus the applicable margin), at the Company s option, at a rate per annum equal to either (a) the Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.65 to 1.65 per annum based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (or, during the Applicable Margin Increase Period (as defined below), an applicable margin of 2.15 per annum), or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined below) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.65 to 2.65 per annum based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (or, during the Applicable Margin Increase Period, an applicable margin of 3.15 per annum). Base Rate means the highest of (a) the federal funds rate (i.e., for any day, the rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the business day next succeeding such day) plus of 1.0 , (b) the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent, as established from time to time at its principal U.S. office (which such rate is an index or base rate and will not necessarily be its lowest or best rate charged to its customers or other banks), or (c) the daily Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month tenor plus 1.0 . The Base Rate is subject to a floor of 1.00 per annum. Adjusted Term SOFR means Term SOFR for the applicable interest period plus 0.10 per annum. Adjusted Term SOFR is subject to a floor of 0.00 per annum. All Euro borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (as defined in the Credit Agreement and subject to a 0.00 per annum floor) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75 to 2.75 per annum based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (or, during the Applicable Margin Increase Period, an applicable margin of 3.25 per annum). In addition, if on or prior to December 31, 2024, we have not reduced the aggregate revolving credit commitment to 340.0 million or less, the applicable margin for all loans shall be increased by 1.00 per annum, and if on or prior to June 30, 2025, we have not reduced the aggregate revolving credit commitment to 300.0 million or less, the applicable margin for all loans shall be increased by 1.00 per annum. 

 56 

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Agreement in respect of unutilized revolving loan commitments on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment of each lender, which commitment fee ranges from 0.20 to 0.25 per annum based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (or, during the Applicable Margin Increase Period, is equal to 0.25 per annum). The Company is also required to pay a participation fee to the Administrative Agent for the account of each lender with respect to the Company s participation in letters of credit at the then applicable rate for Adjusted Term SOFR Loans or EURIBOR Loans, and other customary fronting, issuance and administration fees with respect to letters of credit. The Applicable Margin Interest Period means the period commencing on the Second Amendment Effective Date and ending on the first date when each of the following conditions have been met: (a) the Covenant Relief Period has ended (b) since the Second Amendment Effective Date, the borrowers have repaid the revolving credit outstanding borrowings by a principal amount of at least 75.0 million (c) the borrowers have reduced the aggregate revolving credit commitment to an amount no greater than 300.0 million, and (d) the borrowers are in compliance with all financial covenants based on the financial statements for the most recently completed reference period. Default interest is 2.0 per annum in excess of the rate otherwise applicable. Covenants Under the Credit Agreement The financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, as amended, include the following (capitalized terms used in this subsection and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement or its amendments, as applicable): As of the last day of any fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio may not exceed 5.00x. 

 As of the last day of any fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio may not exceed: 

 In the fiscal quarter in which a Springing Covenant Event occurs and the three consecutive quarterly test periods thereafter, Springing Covenant Period ), the following covenant levels: 

 First fiscal quarter ending after a Springing Covenant Event: 4.00x 

 Second fiscal quarter ending after a Springing Covenant Event: 3.75x 

 Third and fourth fiscal quarters ending after a Springing Covenant Event: 3.50x 

 If the Company or any of its subsidiaries incurs certain unsecured indebtedness in excess of 50.0 million in connection with a transaction that is a Springing Covenant Event or during a Springing Covenant Period, the Consolidated Senor Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant will step down to 3.50x at the time of such incurrence. 

 If a Springing Covenant Period is not in effect, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio may not exceed 3.25x. 

 As of the last day of any fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may not be less than 1.25x. 

 During a Springing Covenant Period, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (i) cash and cash equivalents of the Credit Parties must be at least 50.0 million and (ii) cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries must be at least 70.0 million. 

 All obligations under the Credit Agreement (including under the Subline) are guaranteed by ADTRAN, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of ADTRAN, Inc. Full Facility Guarantors ). To secure such guarantees, ADTRAN, Inc. and the Full Facility Guarantors have granted security interests in favor of the Administrative Agent over substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets, and ADTRAN, Inc. has granted mortgages in favor of the Administrative Agent over certain owned real estate assets. Certain of Adtran Networks' subsidiaries ("Subline Guarantors") have provided a guarantee solely of the obligations in respect of the Subline. Furthermore, to secure such guarantees, the Subline Guarantors have granted security interests in favor of the Administrative Agent over substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets. Adtran Networks has also granted security interests in favor of the Administrative Agent over substantially all of its tangible and intangible assets, to secure solely its obligations under the Subline. Upon repayment in full and termination of the Subline, the guarantees by the Subline Guarantors and the liens granted by Adtran Networks and the Subline Guarantors to secure obligations under the Subline will be released. 

 57 

The Credit Agreement, as amended, contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including incurrence covenants and certain other limitations on the ability of the Company and the Company s subsidiaries to incur additional debt, guarantee other obligations, grant liens on assets, make investments, dispose of assets, make restricted payments, engage in mergers or consolidations, engage in transactions with affiliates, modify its organizational documents, and enter into certain restrictive agreements. The negative covenants are subject to various exceptions and carveouts. It also contains customary events of default, such as misrepresentation and a default in the performance or observance of any covenant (subject to customary cure periods and materiality thresholds). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Administrative Agent is entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of 98.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, improved by 127.8 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of 29.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the declining net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, excluding the goodwill impairment charge of 292.6 million, as adjusted primarily for decreased depreciation and amortization, decreased deferred taxes and increased net cash inflows from working capital. Additional details related to our working capital and its drivers are discussed below. Net accounts receivable decreased 20.5 from 216.4 million as of December 31, 2023, to 172.0 million as of September 30, 2024. There was an allowance for credit losses of 0.4 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The decrease in net accounts receivable was due primarily to a reduction in DSO. Quarterly accounts receivable DSO decreased from 88 days as of December 31, 2023, to 70 days as of September 30, 2024 and was primarily driven by customer and geographical mix of commercial terms. Other receivables decreased 26.3 from 17.5 million as of December 31, 2023, to 12.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The decrease in other receivables was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of raw materials. Quarterly inventory turnover was 2.07 turns as of December 31, 2023, and 2.0 turns as of September 30, 2024. Inventory decreased 21.9 from 362.3 million as of December 31, 2023, to 282.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to steps taken in with our Business Efficiency Program to improve working capital, a reduction in component purchases due to improved lead time, utilization of buffer stock and a 4.1 million write down of inventory due to a restructuring discontinuation of certain product lines within our Network Solutions segment. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory for customer demand and improve working capital. Accounts payable increase 6.4 from 162.9 million as of December 31, 2023, to 173.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of the receipt of inventory, supplies and services. Despite the increase in accounts payable, the average number of days payable to our trade suppliers remained flat at 67 days as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of inventory, supplies and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. Investing Activities Capital expenditures totaled approximately 48.2 million and 33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase software, computer hardware, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements. The increase in capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily attributable to increases in expenditures related to software and building renovation projects. Our long-term investments increased 13.7 from 27.7 million as of December 31, 2023, to 31.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Our investments include various marketable equity securities classified as long-term investments with a fair market value of 0.9 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Long-term investments as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, also included 30.5 million and 26.8 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information. Dividends During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid dividends totaling 21.2 million. On November 6, 2023, the Board of Directors suspended the Company s quarterly cash dividend in order to reduce debt and interest expense and support the Company's capital efficiency program. We consequently did not pay any dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and any other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors; however, the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement currently does not allow for the payment of dividends to shareholders. For additional information, see Note 11 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Liquidity Capital Resources above . Stock Repurchase Program There were no stock repurchases during the periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and there currently is no authorized stock repurchase program. 

 58 

Stock Option Exercises To accommodate employee stock option exercises, the Company issued 36 thousand and 8 thousand shares of common stock which resulted in proceeds of 0.2 million and 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, to accommodate Adtran Networks stock option exercises, Adtran Networks issued 13 thousand shares of Adtran Networks common stock which resulted in proceeds of 0.1 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. No Adtran Networks stock options were exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, all remaining Adtran Networks stock options were modified which resulted in the acceleration of vesting and conversion to liability based awards that were settled for cash totaling 0.2 million. Pension Plans We maintain defined benefit pension plans covering employees in certain foreign countries. The Company's net non-current pension liability for all defined benefit pension plans totaled 12.1 million and 12.5 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively and the net current pension liability for all defined benefit pension plans totaled 0.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, which is included in accounts payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Deferred Compensation Programs We maintain four deferred compensation programs for certain executive management employees and our Board of Directors. The fair value of the assets held by the deferred compensation programs totaled 30.5 million and 26.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in long-term investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts payable to the deferred compensation program participants totaled 32.0 million and 29.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. For additional information, see Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements	 We have exposure to credit losses from off-balance sheet exposures, to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds, where we believe the risk of loss is immaterial to our financial statements as of September 30, 2024. Otherwise, we do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.

The settlement of our purchase obligations will occur at various dates beginning in 2024 and going through 2027. See Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information. (3) We have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Our operating leases had remaining lease terms ranging from 3 months to 170 months as of September 30, 2024. Wells Fargo Credit Agreement On July 18, 2022, ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, entered into the Credit Agreement with the Administrative Agent and the other lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on August 9, 2023, January 16, 2024, March 12, 2024, and June 4, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, ADTRAN, Inc. s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were 189.8 million. The Credit Facility matures in July 2027; however, the Company may request extensions subject to customary conditions. See Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, Item 2 of this report for additional information. Currency Hedging Arrangements On November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangement ("Initial Forward") with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Hedge Counterparty ). The Initial Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge Counterparty, enabled the Company to convert a portion of its euro denominated payment obligations under the proposed DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Initial Forward, the Company agreed to exchange an aggregate notional amount of 160.0 million converted to U.S. dollars at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from approximately EUR/USD 0.98286 to 1.03290. The aggregate amount of 160.0 million was divided into eight quarterly tranches of 20.0 million, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company settled three 20.0 million forward contract tranches, leaving the remaining tranche of 20.0 million to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company, at its sole discretion, may exchange all or part of each tranche on any given day within the applicable quarter; provided, however, that it must exchange the full tranche by the end of such quarter. The Initial Forward may be accelerated or terminated early for a number of reasons, including but not limited to (i) non-payment by the Company or the Hedge Counterparty, (ii) breach of representation or warranty or covenant by either party or (iii) insolvency or bankruptcy of either party. On March 21, 2023, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangements Forward with the Hedge Counterparty. Under the Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge Counterparty, the Company exchanged an aggregate notional amount of 160.0 million converted to U.S. dollars at an average rate of EUR/USD 1.085. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company settled three 20.0 million forward contract tranches, leaving the remaining tranche of 20.0 million to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2024. These forward contracts were executed to sell EUR and to buy USD and were entered into for the purpose of unwinding the Initial Forward to buy EUR and to sell USD. The drawdown dates of the Initial Forward are set to the same date as the maturity of the offsetting Forward. Receivables Purchase Arrangements On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Factoring Agreement with the Factor, which accelerates receivable collection and helps to better manage cash flow. The Factoring Agreement provides for up to 40.0 million in factoring capacity, subject to eligible receivables and reserve requirements, secured by the receivables. Total accounts receivables factored as of the end of September 30, 2024, totaled 16.7 million of which 3.7 million was retained pursuant to the Factoring Agreement in the reserve account. See Note 1 and Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.

On December 19, 2023, the Company entered into the Prior Factoring Agreement with a third-party financial institution which qualified for treatment as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810, Consolidation. The Prior Factoring Agreement was terminated on July 1, 2024. See Note 1 and Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information. Adtran Networks Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement The DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and Adtran Networks SE ("Adtran Networks"), as the controlled company, which was executed on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register Handelsregister of the local court Amtsgericht at the registered seat of Adtran Networks (Jena). Under the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is entitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of Adtran Networks, (ii) Adtran Networks will transfer its annual profit to the Company, subject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net loss incurred by Adtran Networks. The obligation of the Company to absorb Adtran Networks annual net loss applied for the first time to the loss generated in 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either (1) to remain an Adtran Networks shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit Compensation plus guaranteed interest. The guaranteed interest under the Exit Compensation is calculated from the effective date of the DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring Compensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0 plus a variable component (according to the German Civil Code) that was 3.37 as of September 30, 2024. Assuming all the minority holders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate Exit Compensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately 326.9 million or approximately 364.1 million, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, and reflecting interest accrued through September 30, 2024, during the pendency of the appraisal proceedings discussed below. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the second option. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger). We are also obligated to absorb any annual net loss of Adtran Networks under the DPLTA. Additionally, our obligation to pay Annual Recurring Compensation under the DPLTA is a continuing payment obligation, which will amount to approximately 8.9 million or 10.0 million (based on the current exchange rate) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran Networks shareholders were to elect Exit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general shareholders meeting of Adtran Networks for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of the fiscal year). With respect to the 2023 fiscal year, Adtran Networks ordinary general shareholders meeting occurred on June 28, 2024 and, therefore, the Annual Recurring Compensation was paid on July 3, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 2.4 million and 2.6 million, respectively, in Annual Recurring Compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 7.4 million and 7.6 million, respectively, in Annual Recurring Compensation. The Annual Recurring Compensation is reflected as an increase to retained deficit in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. On October 18, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase additional shares of Adtran Networks through open market purchases not to exceed 15,346,544 shares. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 830 thousand shares and 831 thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in total Exit Compensation payments of approximately 15.7 million, or approximately 17.4 million, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, less than 1 thousand shares and 64 thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in Exit Compensation payments of approximately 8 thousand and 1.1 million, respectively, or approximately 9 thousand and 1.2 million, respectively, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2023, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. We currently hold 34,855,921 no-par value bearer shares of Adtran Networks, representing 67.0 of Adtran Networks outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024. The foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a non-binding English translation of which incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024.

Business Efficiency Program On November 6, 2023, due to the uncertainty around the current macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer spending levels, the Company s management decided to implement a business efficiency program Business Efficiency Program targeting the reduction of ongoing operating expenses and focusing on capital efficiency inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early retirement program, a site consolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the potential sale of portions of our headquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension of the quarterly dividend. The Business Efficiency Program expands upon other recently implemented restructuring efforts and synergy costs following the Business Combination. For instance, on August 17, 2023, the Company s management determined to discontinue its copper-based Digital Subscriber Line broadband access technology products and its fixed wireless access products in its Network Solutions segment. Furthermore, on September 29, 2023, the Company s management decided to exit the "IoT" gateway market (indoor and outdoor), a subset of the broader IoT market (together with the other product discontinuations, the Discontinuations ). On October 25, 2023, all employees were informed of certain personnel measures, which included the reduction of salary for select management, a reduction of approximately 5 of the workforce, an early retirement program and a hiring freeze. Additionally, on April 11, 2024, management determined to close a facility in Greifswald, Germany. The closure of the facility is expected to be completed by December 31, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 5.9 million and 40.6 million of costs related to the Business Efficiency Program, respectively. The costs recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included charges of 8.6 million as a result of a strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain items in connection with the Business Efficiency Program, of which, 4.1 million relates to inventory write-downs and 4.6 million relates to other charges, and are included in cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss. Since the inception of the Business Efficiency Program, we recognized 65.6 million of costs. We expect costs in the fourth quarter 2024 relating to the Business Efficiency Program to range between 9.6 million and 13.8 million. Management expects these planned costs to include severance costs to be approximately 6.2 million in connection with reductions in workforce and site consolidation transaction expenses (primarily brokers fees and Greifswald exit costs) ranging from 3.4 million to 7.6 million. The broker fees related to our site consolidation expenses will be netted against proceeds upon the sale of the building(s). Future cash payments include: severance costs and outplacement fees that are anticipated to be in the range of 23.1 million to 23.1 million and payments relating to the site consolidation transaction expenses that are anticipated to be in the range of 3.4 million to 7.6 million. We do not anticipate any remaining payments related to the inventory strategy shift. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Business Efficiency Program, including potential impairment charges related to the discontinuance of additional product lines, regulatory requirements related to personnel measures, and site closures. However, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of amounts of such potential incremental charges as of the date of this filing. If required, we will amend this disclosure at such time as management is able in good faith to estimate the amount, or range of amounts, of these charges. Business Combination Integration Costs During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 0.4 million and 1.4 million, and 1.7 million and 3.1 million of integration costs related to the Business Combination, respectively, that are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, research development expenses and cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Loss. We expect to incur additional integration costs and expenses associated with the implementation of the DPLTA throughout 2024 and such costs are expected to be material. See Note 19 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information. Other Cash Requirements During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other than the Exit Compensation payments, Annual Recurring Compensation under the DPLTA, restructuring costs and increased debt service costs, there have been no other material changes in cash requirements from those discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K and our cash requirements table shown in Liquidity and Capital Resources above. Performance Bonds Certain contracts, customers and jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling 14.6 million and 10.8 million, respectively, which expire at various dates through April 2031. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting Policies An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the results of financial operations. Several accounting policies, as described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, require material subjective or complex judgment and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as applicable. We believe the critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in the financial statements contained in the 2023 Form 10-K, except for goodwill as discussed below. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company s annual impairment assessment is done at the reporting unit level, which we determined are generally the same as our operating segments, which are identified in Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and also test for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. In addition, the Company performs an interim impairment assessment prior to our October 1st annual measurement date, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (or group of assets) may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances may include among others: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate; significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit; and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. During the first quarter of 2024, qualitative factors such as a decrease in the Company s market capitalization, lower service provider spending and delayed holding patterns of inventory with respect to customers caused us to reduce our forecasts, triggering a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units. The Company determined the fair value of the Network Solutions reporting unit using a combination of an income approach and a market-based peer group analysis. The Company determined upon its quantitative impairment assessment to recognize a 292.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the Network Solutions reporting unit during the first quarter of 2024. The quantitative impairment analysis indicated there was no impairment of the Services Support goodwill during the first quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company qualitatively assessed the carrying value of our Services Support reporting unit for events or circumstance changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Based on our assessment of certain qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, management concluded that the fair value of the Services Support reporting unit was more likely than not greater than its carrying amount as of September 30, 2024. Therefore, no impairment of goodwill was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our Network Solutions reporting unit had no remaining goodwill and our Services Support reporting unit had 56.9 million of goodwill as of September 30, 2024, respectively.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency rates, prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. In addition, the ongoing global pandemic raises the possibility of an extended economic downturn and has caused volatility in financial markets. The primary objective of the large majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are investment grade, fixed-rate bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, by restricting, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5.0 of the market value of our total investment portfolio. We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024, 84.2 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits. Although these depository investments exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these financial institutions and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal. Interest Rate Risk As of September 30, 2024, approximately 5.9 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we held 5.9 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 basis point decline in interest rates as of September 30, 2024, assuming all other variables remain constant, would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by less than 0.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amounts of our revolving credit agreements totaled 189.8 million where a change in interest rates would impact our interest expense. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates as of September 30, 2024, assuming all other variables remain constant, would increase our interest expense by 1 million. The analyses cover our debt and investments. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt and investments. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at September 30, 2024. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our revenue and gross margin on revenue derived from some international customers, operating expenses, and assets and liabilities held in non-functional currencies related to our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with the euro and the British pound. Our revenue is primarily denominated in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary and paid in that subsidiary's functional currency or certain other local currency. The majority of our global supply chain predominately makes payments in U.S. dollars and some of our operating expenses are paid in certain local currencies (approximately 56.4 of total operating expense for the year ended September 30, 2024, respectively). Therefore, our revenue, gross margins, operating expenses and operating loss are all subject to foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates could cause variations in our operating loss. A hypothetical 10 movement in foreign exchange rates would result in a before-tax positive or negative impact of approximately 4.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2024. Actual future gains and losses associated with our foreign currency exposures and positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 30, 2024, due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the foreign currency exchange rates, and our actual exposures and positions. We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates used to invoice such customers versus the functional currency of the entity billing such customers may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various derivative transactions, when appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. All non-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of 7.9 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10 against the billing currencies. All non-functional currencies invoiced by suppliers would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of 7.1 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10 against the billing currencies. This change represents an increase in the amount of hypothetical gain or loss compared to prior periods and is mainly due to an increase in U.S. dollar denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary. As of September 30, 2024, we had certain material contracts subject to currency revaluation, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and lease liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2024, we had 41 forward contracts outstanding with a fair value of 0.7 million. The objective of these foreign currency forward contracts is to reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results by offsetting gains and losses on the forward contracts with increases or decreases in foreign currency transactions. We do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Hedging of our currency exposures may not always be effective to protect us against currency exchange rate fluctuations. See Note 10 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

 64 

On November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangement ("Initial Forward") with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Hedge Counterparty ). The Initial Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge Counterparty, enabled the Company to convert a portion of its euro denominated payment obligations under the proposed DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Initial Forward, the Company agreed to exchange an aggregate notional amount of 160.0 million converted to U.S. dollars at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from approximately EUR/USD 0.98286 to 1.03290. The aggregate amount of 160.0 million was divided into eight quarterly tranches of 20.0 million, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company settled three 20.0 million forward contract tranches, leaving the remaining tranche of 20.0 million that will be settled in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company, at its sole discretion, may exchange all or part of each tranche on any given day within the applicable quarter; provided, however, that it must exchange the full tranche by the end of such quarter. The Initial Forward may be accelerated or terminated early for a number of reasons, including but not limited to (i) non-payment by the Company or the Hedge Counterparty, (ii) breach of representation or warranty or covenant by either party or (iii) insolvency or bankruptcy of either party. On March 21, 2023, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangement Forward with the Hedge Counterparty. Under the Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge Counterparty, the Company exchanged an aggregate notional amount of 160.0 million converted to U.S. dollars at an average rate of EUR/USD 1.085. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company settled three 20.0 million forward contract tranches, leaving the remaining tranche of 20.0 million. These forward contracts were executed to sell EUR and to buy USD and were entered into for the purpose of unwinding the Initial Forward to buy EUR and to sell USD. The drawdown dates of the Initial Forward are set to the same date as the maturity of the offsetting Forward. For further information about the fair value of our investments as of September 30, 2024, see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

 65 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, management determined that there were deficiencies in ADTRAN s internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses that existed as of September 30, 2024. Such material weaknesses were as follows: The Company did not design and maintain effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement. Specifically, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting. This material weakness contributed to the following additional material weaknesses: 

 The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over financial statement preparation, presentation and disclosure commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over the presentation and disclosure of transactions, including non-controlling interest. 

 The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to address the initial application of complex accounting standards and accounting of non-routine, unusual or complex events and transactions. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls to timely analyze and account for (i) non-controlling interest and (ii) the receivable purchase and servicing agreement. 

 The material weaknesses resulted in the restatements and revisions of immaterial adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023, as well as the condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024. The material weaknesses also resulted in material adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in misstatements of the Company s accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

 66 

Management s Remediation Efforts To remediate the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the risks of material misstatement, including financial statement preparation, presentation and disclosure of transactions and the non-controlling interest, the Company has started implementing a remediation plan that involves designing and implementing new or enhanced controls over the review of our consolidated financial statements, global identification and reassessment of all key process and controls, increased training and awareness of control activities, and increased scrutiny on control performance and documentation standards. We believe that the foregoing actions will support the improvement of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, and, through our efforts to identify, design, and implement the necessary control activities, will be effective in remediating such material weaknesses. To remediate the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting relating to accounting of non-routine, unusual or complex events and transactions for non-controlling interest and the receivable purchase and servicing agreement, the Company has prepared a remediation plan that includes designing and implementing new controls over the identification and review of contracts, transactions or arrangements that may result in a financial obligation including the use of an accounting specialist as needed to ensure proper presentation of these items within our financial statements. We have taken steps to implement many of the above-referenced controls and are in the process of testing their effectiveness. We will continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may decide to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or determine to modify the remediation plans described above. Until the remediation steps set forth above, including the implementation of all necessary control activities that we identify, are fully completed, and there has been time for us to conclude through testing that the control activities are operating effectively, the material weaknesses described above will not be considered remediated. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Other than the remediation steps described above, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings that arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, Legal Matters ), including those relating to employment matters, patent rights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a Legal Matter, including in a patent dispute, could require the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain jurisdictions. See Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1 of this report for a description of our material legal proceedings, which is incorporated herein by reference. Although the ultimate disposition of asserted claims cannot be predicted with certainty, it is our belief that the outcome of any such claims, either individually or on a combined basis, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS A list of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K other than as described in the risk factors below. Risks related to our financial results and Company success We are obligated to comply with covenants related to our Wells Fargo Credit Agreement that restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate our debt. The Wells Fargo Credit Agreement governing our indebtedness contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all its debt. Our Wells Fargo Credit Agreement along with the amendments thereto, contain various restrictive covenants which include, among others, provisions limiting our ability to: pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase capital stock; 

 incur or guarantee additional debt; 

 make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments; 

 engage in transactions with affiliates; 

 engage in mergers or consolidations; 

 grant or incur liens on assets; 

 dispose of assets; 

 make loans and investments; 

 modify our organization documents; and 

 enter into certain restrictive agreements. 

68 

In addition, the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, such as misrepresentation and a default in the performance or observance of any covenant (subject to customary cure periods and materiality thresholds). In addition, certain covenants in the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, including covenants set forth in the amendments thereto, require us, among other things, to: maintain certain leverage ratios; 

 maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios; and 

 maintain minimum amounts of cash and cash equivalents (during a Springing Covenant Period). 

 As a result of these covenants, we have been and may continue to be: limited in how we conduct our business; 

 limited in how much additional funding we can draw on our line of credit; 

 limited in our ability to raise additional debt to operate during general economic or business downturns; and 

 limited in our ability to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. 

 Our failure to comply with the covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under such debt which would likely have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the applicable facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. In addition, these defaults could impair our ability to access debt and equity capital markets. For additional information on our debt covenants, see "Liquidity Capital Resources" in Part I, Item 2 of this report on Form 10-Q. We require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, our payment obligations to Adtran Networks shareholders under the DPLTA, and other obligations. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to service our outstanding indebtedness could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we have entered into a DPLTA with Adtran Networks. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either (1) to remain an Adtran Networks shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit Compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 831 thousand shares of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company. This resulted in total Exit Compensation payments of approximately 15.7 million, or approximately 17.4 million, based on an exchange rate as of September 30, 2024, being paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. Any failure to satisfy our payment obligations under the DPLTA could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, to cover our payment obligations under the DPLTA, and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we do not sufficiently reduce costs in a timely manner, or if our future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us and our subsidiaries to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital, refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, any of which could have a material adverse effect. The Company experienced revenue declines in the year ended December 31, 2023, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in effecting its plans to preserve cash liquidity and maintain compliance with the Company's covenants on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may need to further reduce capital expenditure and/or take other steps to preserve working capital in order to ensure that we can meet our needs and obligations and maintain compliance with our debt covenants. Our ability to raise additional debt capital or to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments or preferred stock may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness or dividend payments on any future outstanding shares of preferred stock would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or otherwise raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service, payment obligations to Adtran Networks shareholders under the DPLTA, and other obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance 

 69 

of equity or securities convertible into equity, or undertake certain transactions intended to address our existing indebtedness, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of the Company, or our leverage and outstanding indebtedness could increase. Current capital market conditions, including the impact of inflation, have increased borrowing rates and can be expected to significantly increase our cost of capital as compared to prior periods should we seek additional funding. Managing our inventory is complex and has included and may continue to include write downs of excess or obsolete inventory. Managing our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain components that are in short supply, that have been discontinued by the component manufacturer, that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing or that require long lead times. These issues have and may continue to result in our purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, which if not used or expected to be used based on anticipated production requirements, may become excess or obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could also result in sales price reductions and/or inventory write- downs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized write-downs of inventory of 24.3 million due to a discontinuation of certain product lines within our Network Solutions segment in connection with our business efficiency program. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized write-downs of inventory and other charge s of 8.6 million as a result of a strategy shift which included discontinuance of certain items in connection with the Business Efficiency Program, of which, 4.1 million relates to inventory write-downs and 4.5 million relates to other charges. Significant and unanticipated changes in our business could require additional charges for inventory write downs in a future period. Any future charges relating to such inventory write-downs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the periods recognized. For additional details regarding the business efficiency program, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Efficiency Program in Part II, Item 7 of this report. We have recognized impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in the past and may be required to do so in the future. The Business Combination added a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, the inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, the under performance of our business as compared to management s initial expectations, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures, and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets. During the first quarter of 2024, qualitative factors such as a decrease in the Company s market capitalization, lower service provider spending and delayed holding patterns of inventory with respect to customers caused us to reduce our forecasts, triggering a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units. The Company determined upon its quantitative impairment assessment to recognize a 292.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the Network Solutions reporting unit. The quantitative impairment analysis indicated there was no impairment of the Services Support goodwill. The Company will continue to monitor its stock price, operating results and other macroeconomic factors to determine if there is further indication of a sustained decline in fair value requiring an event driven assessment of the recoverability of its remaining goodwill. Any future charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the periods recognized. Risks related to our control environment We have had to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements and, as part of that process, have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reporting and prevent fraud. We have had to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements and, as part of that process, have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have implemented new controls with respect to one material weakness, and we plan to initiate remediation plans with respect to the other material weaknesses. These remediation measures have been time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors do not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, or other regulatory authorities. In either case, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. We can provide no assurance that the measures that we have taken, are taking, and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a 

 70 

failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, while we have strengthened our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, as a public company, we are required to comply with U.S. GAAP, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"), the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. As such, Adtran Networks, as a subsidiary of a public company, has established and is required to maintain effective disclosure controls, as well as internal control over financial reporting under U.S. GAAP. Current and ongoing compliance efforts have and may continue to be costly and require the attention of management. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures and functions that have been integrated, or enhanced at Adtran Networks, particularly those related to the implementation of internal controls for SOX compliance. The maintenance of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. These incremental costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the realization of efficiencies related to the combination of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs. Risks related to the telecommunications industry We depend on a third-party cloud platform provider to host our Mosaic One SaaS network and other operating platforms, and if we were to experience a material disruption or interference in service, our business and reputation could suffer. Our quality of customer service and our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers to use and access our Mosaic One SaaS network operating platform. We use third-party service providers that we do not control for key components of our infrastructure, particularly with respect to delivery of our SaaS products. The use of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored, scalable customer experience, but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities. Third-party service providers operate their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. In the future, we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of our third-party service providers infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Such outages could adversely impact our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, there is no current authorization to repurchase common stock. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION (a) Not applicable (b) Not applicable (c) Insider Trading Arrangements During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s directors or executive officers or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
