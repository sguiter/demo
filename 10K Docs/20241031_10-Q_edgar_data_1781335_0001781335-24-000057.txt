 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

Note 1: 

We assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in the context of the information reasonably available to us and the unknown future impacts of macroeconomic developments, including inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and tighter credit conditions, as of September 30, 2024 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, our allowance for credit losses, the carrying value of our goodwill and other long-lived assets, financial assets and revenue recognition. While there was not a material impact to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulting from our assessments of these matters, future assessment of our expectations of the magnitude and duration of these macroeconomic developments, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in future reporting periods. 
 
 We also assessed certain accounting matters as they relate to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, including, but not limited to, our allowance for credit losses, the carrying value of long-lived assets, revenue recognition and the classification of assets. There was not a material impact to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulting from our assessment of these matters. We continue to assess the impact on our results of operations, financial position and overall performance as the situations develop and any broader implications they may have on the global economy. 
 
 German Tax Litigation. In August 2024, we received a favorable ruling regarding a tax litigation in Germany. As a result, income tax benefits of million and related interest income of million are included in Income tax expense (benefit) and Interest expense (income), net, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The income tax benefits are recorded as an income tax receivable in Other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. The interest income includes the reversal of an interest accrual of million and recognition of an interest receivable of approximately million reflected in Accrued liabilities and Other current assets, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement ("TMA") with RTX Corporation ("RTX", our former parent), the Company recorded indemnification expense of million for amounts due to RTX resulting from the outcome of this tax litigation in Germany. This expense is included in Other expense (income), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the resulting amounts due to RTX are included in Accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024.

 Supplier Finance Programs. Certain Otis subsidiaries participate in supplier finance programs, under which we agree to pay third-party financial institutions the stated amounts of confirmed invoices from suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, while the participating suppliers generally have the ability to sell, or otherwise pledge as collateral, their receivables from the Company to the participating financial institutions. The outstanding obligations confirmed by the Company as valid to the financial institutions under our supplier finance programs were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, including million as of September 30, 2024 related to new programs with payment terms of days from the invoice date. These obligations are included in Accounts payable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and all activity related to the obligations is presented within operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 Refer to Note 2 of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2023 Form 10-K for details regarding the Company's supplier financing programs with payment terms of supplier invoices ranging between and days from the invoice date. 

Note 2: 
 
 Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding Stock awards and equity units (share equivalent) Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding Earnings Per Share of Common Stock: Basic Diluted 
 
 The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock appreciation rights and stock options, when the average market price of the Common Stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock awards during the period because the effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards when the awards' assumed proceeds exceed the average market price of the common shares during the period. There were million of anti-dilutive stock awards excluded from the computation for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to million for the same periods in 2023. 
 
 The impact of redeemable noncontrolling interest to Net income attributable to common shareholders was immaterial in the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Although this reflects the segments to which the restructuring costs relate, refer to Note 17 for more information about our measure of segment performance (segment operating profit), which no longer includes restructuring costs, among other items, beginning in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 UpLift Restructuring Actions and Transformation Costs. During the third quarter of 2023, we announced UpLift to transform our operating model. UpLift includes, among other aspects, the standardization of our processes and improvement of our supply chain procurement, as well as organizational changes which result in restructuring actions. 
 
 UpLift restructuring actions of up to million were approved in 2023, with additional actions initiated in 2024. These costs are primarily severance related costs. We expect these actions initiated during 2024 and 2023 to be substantially completed and cash to be paid by the end of 2024, with payments for certain actions to be completed in 2025. Expected total costs and remaining costs to incur for the actions initiated are approximately million and million, respectively. 
 
 In the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred million and million, respectively, of incremental, non-restructuring costs associated with transforming our operating model as a part of UpLift ("UpLift transformation costs"), including consulting and personnel costs, which are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We incurred million of UpLift transformation costs in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other Restructuring Actions. The other restructuring expenses incurred during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were primarily the result of restructuring programs initiated during 2024 and 2023 related to severance and facility exit costs. We are targeting to complete by the end of 2025 the majority of remaining other restructuring actions initiated in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the full year 2023, with certain utilization beyond 2025 due to contractual obligations or legal requirements in the applicable jurisdictions. Expected total costs and remaining costs to incur for the other restructuring actions initiated are million and million, respectively. Remaining costs are expected to be approximately New Equipment and Service.

 The Company provides certain financial guarantees to third parties. As of September 30, 2024, Otis has stand-by letters of credit with maximum potential payment totaling million. We accrue costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. In accordance with ASC Topic 460: Guarantees , we record these liabilities at fair value. As of September 30, 2024, Otis has determined there are no estimated costs probable under these guarantees.

million (approximately million) in order to avoid additional interest accruals pending final resolution of this matter. In March 2016, the local German Tax Court dismissed the suit, and we appealed this decision to the German Federal Tax Court. Following a hearing in July 2018, the German Federal Tax Court remanded the matter to the local German Tax Court for further proceedings. In December 2020, the local German Tax Court ruled against the Company. 
 
 On January 26, 2021, the Company filed an appeal with the German Federal Tax Court. On February 8, 2022, the Company received the decision of the German Federal Tax Court, in which the Court remanded the case for reconsideration by the local German Tax Court. The local German Tax Court held a hearing on June 12, 2023, and issued a decision in favor of Otis on July 21, 2023. On September 14, 2023, the German tax authorities filed an appeal to the German Federal Tax Court. On August 13, 2024, the German Federal Tax Court rejected the appeal, concluding the litigation in favor of the Company. 
 
 As a result of the court's decision, the Company expects to receive a refund of prepaid tax, prepaid interest, overpayment interest, and court fees of approximately million net of tax (approximately million as of September 30, 2024). We expect the refund will be paid to the Company over several quarters, starting in the fourth quarter of 2024 and continuing through the end of 2025, by which time the Company expects to receive substantially all of the refund. The Company has also released the liability associated with the remaining interest of million (approximately million) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Any recoveries related to this matter would be allocated between RTX and the Company pursuant to the terms of the TMA with our former parent, UTC, by way of indemnification payments. Based on its understanding of the facts and contractual provisions as of this date, and taking into account its limited access to information to support the calculation, the Company has estimated the additional tax and interest to be paid by RTX as a result of this recovery to be million and has recorded this amount in its financial statements. The parties are still in process of resolving the scope of the indemnity obligation and the final indemnity amount. 
 
 See Note 1, "General" for additional information on the impacts of the litigation and TMA activity to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the quarter and year ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Asbestos Matters 
 
 We have been named as defendants in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos. While we have never manufactured any asbestos-containing component parts, and no longer incorporate asbestos in any current products, certain of our historical products have contained components manufactured by third parties incorporating asbestos. A substantial majority of these asbestos-related claims have been dismissed without payment or were covered in full or in part by insurance or other forms of indemnity. Additional cases were litigated and settled without any insurance reimbursement. The amounts involved in asbestos-related claims were not material individually or in the aggregate as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The estimated range of total liabilities to resolve all pending and unasserted potential future asbestos claims through 2059 is approximately million to million as of September 30, 2024, and approximately million to million as of December 31, 2023. Since no amount within the range of estimates is more likely to occur than any other, we have recorded the minimum amounts of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are principally recorded in Other long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts are on a pre-tax basis, not discounted, and exclude the Company's legal fees to defend the asbestos claims (which will continue to be expensed as they are incurred). In addition, the Company has an insurance recovery receivable for probable asbestos-related recoveries of approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are principally included in Other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Other. We have commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue contingencies based on a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, we accrue the minimum amount. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these claims and whether they will be resolved consistent with our beliefs, we expect that the outcome of such claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

 operating segments: New Equipment and Service. Through the New Equipment segment, we design, manufacture, sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators as well as escalators and moving walkways in the residential and commercial building and infrastructure projects. The Service segment provides maintenance and repair services for both our products and those of other manufacturers, and provides modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. The operating segments are generally based on the management structure of the Company, how management allocates resources, assesses performance and makes strategic and operational decisions. 
 
 Segment Information. Otis discloses segment operating profit as its measure of segment performance, reconciled to total Otis operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to segments (as described below in "Corporate and Unallocated"). 
 
 Effective in the first quarter of 2024, the measure of segment performance used by Otis' Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") changed and, as a result, Otis' disclosed measure of segment performance (segment operating profit) was updated. The change to segment operating profit aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's segments, and therefore is our measure of segment profitability in accordance with GAAP under ASC 280, Segment Reporting . 
 
 As a result of the change, restructuring costs and other items not allocated to the operating segments are presented as part of Corporate and Unallocated. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the measure of segment performance change for all periods presented.

 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Otis Worldwide Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024 , and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, and of changes in equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , including the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 2, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 
 Business Summary 
 
 We are the world s leading elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Our Company is organized into two segments, New Equipment and Service. Through our New Equipment segment, we design, manufacture, sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators and moving walkways for residential and commercial buildings and infrastructure projects. Our New Equipment customers include real-estate and building developers and general contractors who develop and/or design buildings for residential, commercial, retail or mixed-use activity. We sell our New Equipment directly to customers, as well as through agents and distributors. 
 
 Through our Service segment, we perform maintenance and repair services for both our own products and those of other manufacturers and provide modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. Maintenance services include inspections to ensure code compliance, preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs, as well as repair services to address equipment and component wear and tear and breakdowns. Modernization services enhance equipment operation and improve building functionality. Modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics to complex upgrades of larger components and sub-systems. Our typical Service customers include building owners, facility managers, housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed. 
 
 We serve our customers through a global network of e mployees. These include sales personnel, field technicians with separate skills in performing installation and service, as well as engineers driving our continued product development and innovation. We function under a centralized operating model whereby a global strategy is set around New Equipment and Service because we seek to grow our maintenance portfolio, in part, through the conversion of new elevator and escalator installations into service contracts. Accordingly, we benefit from an integrated global strategy, which sets priorities and establishes accountability across the full product life cycle. 
 
 The current statu s of significant factors affecting our business environment in 2024 is discussed below. For additional discussion, refer to the "Business Overview" section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K . 
 
 For discussion of Otis ESG goals and risks associated therewith, see the discussion under Environmental, Social and Governance ESG in Item 1 and under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K . 
 
 UpLift 
 
 Announced in July 2023, UpLift is a program with the goal of transforming our operating model. UpLift will include the standardization of our processes and improvement of our supply chain procurement, among other aspects of the program, as well as restructuring actions. We expect UpLift to generate approximately 175 million in annual savings by mid-year 2025, with restructuring and other incremental costs to complete the transformation ("UpLift transformation costs") over that period of at least the same amount. 
 
 UpLift costs incurred in the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 
 
 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 UpLift restructuring cost 4 11 UpLift transformation cost 18 4 45 4 Total UpLift costs 22 4 56 4 
 
 Total UpLift costs incurred to date are 97 million, including 36 million of restructuring costs and 61 million of transformation costs.

Table of Contents 

 UpLift restructuring costs are primarily severance costs, and are recorded primarily in Selling, general and administrative in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. UpLift transformation costs are primarily consulting and incremental personnel costs, and are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 For further details, refer to the discussion on restructuring costs in the "Results of Operations," as well as Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 German Tax Litigation 
 
 In August 2024, we received a favorable ruling regarding a German tax litigation. As a result, we recorded income tax benefits of 185 million and related interest income of 200 million, which are included in Income tax expense (benefit), net and Interest expense (income), net, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement ("TMA") with RTX Corporation ("RTX", our former parent), the Company recorded indemnification expense of 194 million for amounts due to RTX resulting from the outcome of the German tax litigation. This expense is included in Other expense (income), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For further details, refer to Note 11 and Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Impact of Global Macroeconomic Developments on Our Company 
 
 Global macroeconomic developments have impacted, and continue to impact, aspects of the Company's operations and overall financial performance during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These macroeconomic developments include, among others, inflationary pressures, high interest rates and tighter credit conditions. These macroeconomic trends could continue to impact our business, including impacts to overall financial performance during the remainder of 2024, as a result of the following, among other things: 
 
 Supplier liquidity, as well as supplier and raw material capacity constraints, delays and related costs; 
 Customer demand impacting our new equipment, maintenance and repair, and modernization businesses; 
 Customer liquidity constraints and related credit reserves; and 
 Cancellations or delays of customer orders. 
 
 We currently do not expect any significant impact to our capital and financial resources from these macroeconomic developments, including to our overall liquidity position based on our available cash and cash equivalents and our access to credit facilities and the capital markets. 
 
 See the "Liquidity and Financial Condition" section in this Form 10-Q for further detail and Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K for macroeconomic risks related to our business. 
 
 Risks Associated with Ongoing Conflicts 
 
 The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, including volatile commodity markets, foreign exchange fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber-security incidents, reputational risk, increased operating costs (including fuel and other input costs), environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions and other regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). We do not have operations in Russia. 
 
 To the extent possible, we continue to operate our business in Ukraine, which represented less than 1 of our revenue and operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Additionally, we do not have operations or material net sales in Israel or Gaza. Although we have operations in the Middle East and transport products through the Red Sea, we currently do not expect the recent conflicts in that region to have a material impact on our business. 
 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 We cannot predict how the events described above will evolve. Depending on the ultimate outcomes of these conflicts, which remain uncertain, they could heighten certain risks disclosed in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K , including but not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including increased inflation, constraints on the availability of commodities, supply chain disruption and decreased business spending; cyber-incidents; disruptions to our or our business partners global technology infrastructure, including through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; claims, litigation and regulatory enforcement; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; terrorist activities; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; reputational risk; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 Preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The accounting policies that involve the most significant estimates, assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, or are the most sensitive to change due to outside factors, are discussed in the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates" included in o ur 2023 Form 10-K . Except as disclosed in Note 18 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, pertaining to adoption of new accounting pronouncements, there have been no material changes in these policies.

 The Organic volume increase of 1.2 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase of 7.7 in Service, partially offset by a decrease of (8.2) in New Equipment. The Organic volume increase of 1.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase of 6.4 in Service, partially offset by a decrease of (6.3) in New Equipment.

 The organic increase in total cost of products and services sold for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the organic sales changes noted above. Productivity and lower commodity prices, primarily steel, were partially offset by inflationary pressures, including annual wage increases and higher Service-related material costs.

 Gross margin percentage increased 70 and 60 basis points for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due to Service sales growing faster than New Equipment sales, the benefits from productivity and lower commodity prices, partially offset by the inflationary pressures described above.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased (20) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, driven by savings resulting from UpLift, cost containment actions and favorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by annual wage increases. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were flat and decreased (20) basis points for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Restructuring Costs 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 UpLift restructuring 11 Other restructuring 29 36 Total restructuring costs 40 36 
 
 We initiate restructuring actions to keep our cost structure competitive. Charges generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions, and facility exit and lease termination costs associated with the consolidation of office and manufacturing operations. We continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to keep our cost structure aligned with the demands of the prevailing market conditions. 
 
 There were 11 million of UpLift restructuring costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We also incurred 45 million of UpLift transformation costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consulting and incremental personnel costs, which are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Other restructuring costs were 29 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and included 17 million of costs related to 2024 actions and 12 million of costs related to 2023 actions. 
 
 Most of the expected charges will require cash payments, which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations. The table below presents approximate cash outflows related to the restructuring actions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the expected cash payments to complete the actions announced: 
 
 (dollars in millions) UpLift Actions Other Actions Total Restructuring Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 20 25 45 Expected cash payments remaining to complete actions announced 22 58 80 
 
 The approved UpLift restructuring actions are expected to generate approximately 55 million in annual recurring savings by 2025, primarily in Selling, general and administrative expenses, and of which approximately 26 million was realized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For other restructuring actions, we generally expect to achieve annual recurring savings within the two-year period subsequent to initiating the actions, including 12 million for the 2024 actions and 42 million for the 2023 actions, split evenly in Cost of Products and Services Sold and in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Approximately 34 million of savings was realized for the 2024 and 2023 actions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other income (expense), net (220) 13 (227) 32 
 
 The changes in Other income (expense), net, of (233) million and (259) million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily driven by Separation-related adjustments of 193 million and 177 million, respectively, UpLift transformation costs of 18 million and 45 million, respectively, 18 million of impairment loss related to net assets held for sale and foreign currency mark-to-market adjustments. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by non-recurring litigation-related settlement costs, including 18 million in the second quarter of 2024.

 The changes in Interest expense (income), net of (189) million and (188) million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily driven by 200 million related to a favorable ruling received in August 2024 regarding a tax litigation in Germany, partially offset by higher interest expense related to the 750 million unsecured, unsubordinated debt issued in August 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by interest reserve adjustments related to non-recurring tax items, when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 The average interest rate on our long-term debt for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 2.5 and 2.1 , respectively. For additional discussion of borrowings, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Effective tax rate (8.8) 25.8 11.2 25.7 
 
 The decrease in the effective tax rate for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to recognition of estimated tax benefits arising as a result of the resolution of the German tax litigation. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by the reduction in a deferred tax liability related to the mitigation of future repatriation costs. 
 
 We anticipate some variability in the tax rate quarter to quarter from potential discrete items.

 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 We expect to fund our ongoing operating, investing and financing requirements mainly through cash flows from operations, available liquidity through cash on hand and available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 827 million, of which approximately 95 was held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost-effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. On occasion, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations related to acquisitions and divestitures or other legal obligations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of such restricted cash was approximately 5 million and 6 million, respectively. 
 
 From time-to-time we may need to access the capital markets to obtain financing. We may incur indebtedness or issue equity as needed. Although we believe that the arrangements in place as of September 30, 2024 permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future could be impacted by many factors, including (1) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (2) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (3) the current state of the economy, including tighter credit conditions. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 The following table contains several key measures of our financial condition and liquidity: 
 
 (dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 827 1,274 Total debt 7,263 6,898 Net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) 6,436 5,624 Total equity (4,835) (4,855) Total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) 2,428 2,043 Net capitalization (total debt plus total equity less cash and cash equivalents) 1,601 769 Total debt to total capitalization 299 338 Net debt to net capitalization 402 731 
 
 The Company does not intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. For the remainder of the Company s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, we will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. 
 
 Borrowings and Lines of Credit 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had a revolving credit agreement with various banks providing for a 1.5 billion unsecured, unsubordinated five-year revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. The undrawn portion of the revolving credit agreement serves as a backstop for the issuance of commercial paper. 
 
 There was 316 million of commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2024. For additional discussion of borrowings, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On December 1, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to 2.0 billion of Common Stock, of which approximately 400 million was remaining as of September 30, 2024. Under this program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs or under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 Discussion of Cash Flows 
 
 The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows. For additional details, see the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 873 1,030 Investing activities (210) (132) Financing activities (1,102) (418) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (9) (34) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (448) 446 
 
 Operating activities 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with our operations. Primary activities include net income from operations adjusted for non-cash transactions, working capital changes and changes in other assets and liabilities. 
 
 The year-over-year decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by working capital balances during the periods, including a larger decrease in Accounts payable in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the decrease the same period in 2023 due to the timing of payments to suppliers, as well as the timing of income tax payments and the related income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, Separation-related and UpLift-related net payments were approximately 49 million and 54 million, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net payments of approximately 25 million and 2 million, respectively, in the same period in 2023. These were partially offset by a smaller increase in Accounts receivable, net, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the increase the same period in 2023 due to the timing of billings and collections. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 873 million. Net income of 1.4 billion includes 185 million of income taxes benefits, 200 million of interest income and 194 million of indemnification expense resulting from the outcome of the German tax litigation during the third quarter of 2024, none of which resulted in cash flow activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net income was also partially offset by a decrease in Accounts payable due to the timing of payments to suppliers, an increase in Accounts receivable, net, due to the timing of billings and collections, a decrease in Accrued liabilities and an increase in Other current assets due to the timing of payments, including employee-related benefits, income taxes and supplier payments. For additional discussion of the German tax litigation, see Note 1 and Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 1.0 billion. The primary drivers of the inflow related to 1.2 billion of net income and changes in Contract assets and liabilities, net, due to the timing of billings on contracts compared to the progression on current contracts. These were partially offset by an increase in Accounts receivable, net, due to the timing of billings. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with long-term assets, including capital expenditures, investments in businesses and securities, proceeds from the sale of fixed assets and the settlement of derivative contracts. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 210 million. The primary drivers of the outflow related to 87 million of capital expenditures, 70 million of acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets and 47 million of net cash payments from the settlement of derivative instruments. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 132 million. The primary drivers of the outflow related to 96 million of capital expenditures, 27 million of acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets and 21 million of net cash payments from the settlement of derivative instruments. 
 43 

Table of Contents 

As discussed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes. We operate internationally and, in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We use derivative instruments, including forward contracts and options to manage certain foreign currency and commodity price exposures. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with equity and borrowings. Primary activities include short-term and long-term borrowing activity, paying dividends to shareholders, the repurchase of our Common Stock and dividends or other payments to noncontrolling interests. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 1.1 billion. The primary drivers of the outflow were the repurchases of our Common Stock of 800 million, dividends paid on our Common Stock and to noncontrolling shareholders of 450 million and 81 million, respectively, and acquisitions of noncontrolling interest shares of 75 million, including approximately 70 million for our subsidiary in Japan. These were partially offset by short term borrowings of 325 million. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 418 million. The primary drivers of the outflow were repurchases of our Common Stock of 575 million, dividends paid on our Common Stock and to noncontrolling shareholders of 400 million and 76 million, respectively, and net repayments of short-term borrowings of 90 million. These were partially offset by 741 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, a portion of which was used to fund the repayment at maturity of the 500 million 0.000 notes due November 12, 2023.

 Guaranteed Securities: Summarized Financial Information 
 
 The following information is provided in compliance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the 2026 Euro Notes and the 2031 Euro Notes (together the "Euro Notes"), in each case issued by Highland Holdings S. r.l.

 Highland is a wholly-owned, indirect consolidated subsidiary of OWC. OWC is incorporated under the laws of Delaware. As a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg, and with its registered office in Luxembourg, Highland is subject to Luxembourg insolvency and bankruptcy laws in the event any insolvency proceedings are initiated against it.

 The Euro Notes are not guaranteed by any of OWC's or Highland's subsidiaries (all OWC subsidiaries other than Highland are referred to herein as "non-guarantor subsidiaries"). Holders of the Euro Notes will have a direct claim only against Highland, as issuer, and OWC, as guarantor. 
 
 The following tables set forth the summarized financial information as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023 of each of OWC and Highland on a standalone basis, which does not include the consolidated impact of the assets, liabilities, and financial results of their subsidiaries except as noted on the tables below, nor does it include any impact of intercompany eliminations as there were no intercompany transactions between OWC and Highland.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 
 Item 5 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Form 10-K discloses our off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to these off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations, outside the ordinary course of business except for those disclosed in "Note 7, Borrowings and Lines of Credit" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s market risk during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of the Company s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company s market risk disclosures set forth in Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our 2023 Form 10-K . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and the Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer ("CAO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, our CFO and our CAO have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, our CFO and our CAO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results 
 
 This Form 10-Q contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute forward-looking statements under the securities laws. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other information released to the public. These forward-looking statements are intended to provide management s current expectations or plans for Otis future operating and financial performance, based on assumptions currently believed to be valid. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, expectations, plans, strategy, prospects, estimate, project, target, anticipate, will, should, see, guidance, outlook, medium-term, near-term, confident, goals and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. Forward-looking statements may include, among other things, statements relating to future sales, earnings, cash flow, results of operations, uses of cash, dividends, share repurchases, tax rates, R D spend, restructuring actions (including UpLift), credit ratings, net indebtedness and other measures of financial performance or potential future plans, strategies or transactions, or statements that relate to climate change and our intent to achieve certain ESG targets or goals, including operational impacts and costs associated therewith, and other statements that are not historical facts. All forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. For those statements, Otis claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, without limitation: 
 
 the effect of economic conditions in the industries and markets in which Otis and its businesses operate and any changes therein, including financial market conditions, fluctuations in commodity prices, and other inflationary pressures, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, levels of end market demand in construction, pandemic health issues, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, and the financial condition of Otis customers and suppliers; 
 the effect of changes in political conditions in the U.S., including in connection with the results of the 2024 election or otherwise, and other countries in which Otis and its businesses operate, including the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, and tensions between the U.S. and China, on general market conditions, commodity costs, global trade policies and related sanctions and export controls, and currency exchange rates in the near term and beyond; 
 challenges in the development, production, delivery, support, performance and realization of the anticipated benefits of advanced technologies and new products and services; 
 future levels of indebtedness, capital spending and research and development spending; 
 future availability of credit and factors that may affect such availability or costs thereof, including credit market conditions and Otis capital structure; 
 the timing and scope of future repurchases of Otis common stock ("Common Stock"), which may be suspended at any time due to various factors, including market conditions and the level of other investing activities and uses of cash; 
 fluctuations in prices and delays and disruption in delivery of materials and services from suppliers, whether as a result of changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conflicts or otherwise; 
 cost reduction or containment actions, restructuring costs and related savings and other consequences thereof, including with respect to UpLift; 
 new business and investment opportunities; 
 the outcome of legal proceedings, investigations and other contingencies; 
 pension plan assumptions and future contributions; 
 the impact of the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements and labor disputes and labor inflation in the markets in which Otis and its businesses operate globally; 
 the effect of changes in tax, environmental, regulatory (including among other things import/export) and other laws and regulations in the U.S., including in connection with the results of the 2024 election, and other countries in which Otis and its businesses operate; 
 the ability of Otis to retain and hire key personnel; 
 the scope, nature, impact or timing of acquisition and divestiture activity, the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses and realization of synergies and opportunities for growth and innovation and incurrence of related costs; 
 the determination by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and other tax authorities that the distribution or certain related transactions in connection with the Separation should be treated as taxable transactions; and 
 our obligations and our disputes that have or may hereafter arise under the agreements we entered into with RTX and Carrier in connection with the Separation.

 Item 5. Other Information 
 
 Insider Adoption or Termination of Trading Arrangements 
 
 , our , none of our directors or officers or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as those terms are defined in Regulation S-K. On , Ms. Marks adopted a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). Under the trading plan, the shares received by Ms. Marks upon the vesting of the performance stock units (PSUs) granted to her by the Company on February 3, 2022 (after giving effect to tax withholding and a previous election to defer 50 of the PSU shares earned) and shares that Ms. Marks previously received upon the vesting of other awards she received will be sold if a limit price is achieved. In addition, the trading plan provides for Ms. Marks to exercise and then sell, if limit prices are achieved, shares received (after giving effect to tax withholding) upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights granted to her in 2018 and stock appreciation rights granted to her in 2019. The number of shares that could be sold in respect of the stock appreciation rights will depend on the Company s stock price and applicable tax rates. The trading plan will terminate on . 
 
 The number of shares that may be sold by Ms. Marks upon vesting of the PSUs will depend upon the Company s achievement of the underlying financial performance goals and the application of a multiplier factor based on our relative total shareowner return over the 2022-2024 performance period, and can range from 0 to 200 of the sum of the target PSUs granted plus additional PSUs credited for dividend equivalents. Ms. Marks was granted 59,404 target PSUs on February 3, 2022. However, because Ms. Marks previously elected to defer receipt of 50 of the PSUs to be earned under our PSU Deferral Plan, the number of shares delivered to her at vesting and available for sale will be accordingly reduced. Assuming the limit price required is achieved, we estimate, based on our projected performance against the underlying financial goals, our relative total shareholder return through September 30, 2024, current tax withholding rates, future crediting of dividend equivalents assuming our current dividend remains unchanged and a stock price of 103.94 (the closing price of our stock on September 30, 2024), and Ms. Marks election to defer 50 of the PSUs, that shares could be sold under the trading plan in respect of the PSUs.
