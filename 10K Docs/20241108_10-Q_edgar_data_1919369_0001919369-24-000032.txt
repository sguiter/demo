Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements or any other information, except as required by applicable law. Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when interest and/or principal payments become materially past due and there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Recognition of interest income of that loan will be ceased until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. However, the Company remains contractually entitled to this interest. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid or there is no longer any reasonable doubt that such principal or interest will be collected in full and, in the Company s judgment, are likely to remain current. The Company may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value or is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected, and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. The Company did not have any loans on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Other income may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, unused, underwriting, arranger and prepayment fees associated with the Company s investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by the Company to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are

 The Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments that are categorized as Level 3: 
 The Company s Board has appointed the Adviser as its valuation designee, in accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. The fair value is determined by the Adviser s valuation committee, subject to oversight by the Board, consistent with a documented valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. In connection with that determination, investment valuations will be prepared using ranges of valuations obtained from independent valuation firms, and/or proprietary models depending on the materiality of the investments, the availability of information on the Company s investments and the type of investment being valued, all in accordance with the Company s valuation policy. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. As part of the valuation process, the factors that may be taken into account in determining the fair value of the Company s investments include, as relevant: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Adviser s valuation committee will consider whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 
 Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated to determine whether the enterprise value of the portfolio company is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Adviser carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value the Company s portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being

 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in first lien debt securities are discount rates and transaction prices. Significant increases in discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in transaction prices in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. 
 
 The significant unobservable input used in the market approach is the performance multiple, which may include a revenue multiple, EBITDA multiple, or forward-looking metrics. The multiple is used to estimate the enterprise value of the underlying investment. An increase or decrease in the multiple would result in an increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value.

 Total borrowings 
 Secured borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consist of borrowings under the SMBC Credit Facility and the DB Credit Facility (each as defined in Note 5. Borrowings) which closed on November 17, 2023, and June 26, 2024, respectively. Given there were no material market movements in credit spreads from November 17, 2023 through September 30, 2024 and given the underlying interest rate on any secured borrowing is based on an underlying index that resets on a periodic basis, the carrying values of the secured borrowings approximate fair value. Secured borrowings are categorized as Level 3 within the hierarchy.

 The Management Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the Company s net asset value as of the last day of the immediately preceding quarter. Such amount shall be appropriately adjusted (based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter) for any share issuances or repurchases during a calendar quarter. In addition, the Management Fee for any partial quarter shall be appropriately prorated. For the purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, net assets mean the Company s total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period. The Management Fee incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively. The remains payable as of September 30, 2024 . 
 The Incentive Fee will consist of two components: the investment income component (the Investment Income Incentive Fee ), and the capital gains component (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee ). The two components are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. 
 (i) Investment Income Incentive Fee 
 The Investment Income Incentive Fee is calculated quarterly in arrears based on pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means dividends (including reinvested dividends), interest and fee income accrued by the Company during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the calendar quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable to the Adviser under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that the Company may not have received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of per quarter annualized).

 per quarter annualized); 
 of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than annualized). This portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than is referred to as the catch-up and 
 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds annualized). 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company earned an Investment Income Incentive Fee of and respectively. The remains payable as of September 30, 2024. There was Investment Income Incentive Fee earned in the prior comparable periods. 
 (ii) Capital Gains Incentive Fee 
 The second component of the Incentive Fee, the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, is payable in arrears at the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to of cumulative realized capital gains from initial drawdown through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Incentive Fees. 
 
 The Company will accrue, but will not pay, a Capital Gains Incentive Fee with respect to aggregate unrealized appreciation on investments because a Capital Gains Incentive Fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investments and realize a capital gain. If the Capital Gain Incentive Fee base, adjusted to include unrealized capital appreciation, is positive at the end of a period, then the Company will accrue a capital gain incentive fee equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of the actual Capital Gain Incentive Fees paid and capital gain incentive fees accrued in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. The resulting accrual in a given period may result in additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a reversal in the Capital Gains Incentive Fee of ) and ), respectively, and as of September 30, 2024 there was Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable. There was Capital Gains Incentive Fee earned in the prior comparable periods. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is required by U.S. GAAP to record an investment at its fair value as of the time of acquisition instead of at the actual amount paid for such investment (including, for example, as a result of the application of the asset acquisition method of accounting), then solely for the purposes of calculating the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, the accreted or amortized cost basis of an investment shall be an amount (the Contractual Cost Basis equal to (1) (x) the actual amount paid by the Company for such investment plus (y) any amounts recorded in the Company s financial statements as required by U.S. GAAP that are attributable to the accretion of such investment plus (z) any other adjustments made to the cost basis included in the Company s financial statements, including payment-in-kind interest or additional amounts funded (net of repayments) minus (2) any amounts recorded in the Company s financial statements as required by U.S. GAAP that are attributable to the amortization of such investment, whether such calculated Contractual Cost Basis is higher or lower than the fair value of such investment (as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP) at the time of acquisition. 
 The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant period. 
 Administration Agreement 
 On June 16, 2023, the Company entered into the Administration Agreement with its Adviser. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Adviser will perform, or oversee the performance of, administrative services, which includes, but is not limited to, providing office facilities, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and the Board and reports filed with the SEC, managing the payment of expenses, providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which the Company is required to provide such assistance, assisting the Company in determining and publishing (as necessary or appropriate) the Company s net asset value and overseeing the preparation and filing of the Company s tax returns and the performance of administrative and

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with ITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS . This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or the future performance or financial condition of Vista Credit Strategic Lending Corp. (the Company and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 8, 2024. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Forward Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward- looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on March 15, 2022. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). We also intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a regulated investment company (a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a BDC, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of investments that will primarily consist of senior or subordinated debt, preferred stock or other interests senior to common equity as well as equity securities (or rights to acquire equity securities) acquired in connection with debt financing transactions in management buyouts, recapitalizations and other opportunities. Our investment strategy is intended to generate favorable returns across credit cycles with an emphasis on preserving capital. To achieve our investment objective, we will leverage an extensive network of relationships with other sophisticated institutions to source, evaluate and, as appropriate, partner with on transactions. There are no assurances that we will achieve our investment objective. 
 We expect to invest in middle market companies, which we define to generally mean companies with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA of less than 250 million annually, and/or annual revenue of 25 million to 2.5 billion at the time of investment, in the enterprise software, data and technology-enabled business sectors, which focus on designing and implementing software solutions specifically to meet the needs of large, complex organizations. We may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when we believe that there are dislocations in the capital markets such that assets are mispriced on an absolute or relative basis, including the high yield and syndicated loan markets. We generally intend to invest in companies with a low loan-to-value ratio, which we consider to be 50 or below. The loan-to-value ratio measures the relationship between our investment and the enterprise value of the related borrower/issuer (i.e., the aggregate assets securing the investment). The enterprise value of our borrowers typically range from 500 million to over 5.0 billion. Our target credit investments will typically have maturities between three and seven years with an average duration between three and five years and generally range in size between 10 million and 75 million. The investment size will vary based on numerous factors, including the size of our capital base. 
 We expect to generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, we anticipate that many of our debt investments will have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically will not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which could increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment. Under normal circumstances, we will invest at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in credit investments (loans, bonds and other credit instruments). Our credit investments will typically consist of first lien, unitranche, and second lien debt facilities, and may include mezzanine debt, any of which may be covenant-lite (i.e., loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants). 
 On June 16, 2023, Vista Credit BDC Management, L.P. (our Adviser ), purchased 1,250.000 shares of our common stock at 20.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of such shares. 
 On September 8, 2023 and September 22, 2023, we held our initial closings and entered into subscription agreements with investors providing for the private placement of our shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had received capital commitments totaling 527.8 million, 22.5 million of which is contingent on receiving additional capital commitments, ensuring that at all times, the aggregate commitments of an individual investor does not exceed 
 35 

24.99 of our aggregate commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we have issued 9,606,809.359 shares of our common stock, for gross proceeds of 190.0 million. 
 Total capital commitments as of September 30, 2024, include a 50.0 million capital commitment from VHG Capital, L.P., an entity affiliated with us and the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024, VHG Capital, L.P. had purchased 889,799.612 shares of common stock for a total purchase price of 18.2 million. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Discounts from and premiums to par value on investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. To the extent loans contain payment-in-kind PIK provisions, PIK interest, computed at the contractual rates is accrued and recorded as interest income and added to the principal balance of the loan. PIK interest income added to the principal balance is generally collected upon repayment of the outstanding principal. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. In addition, we may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized as additional interest income over the life of the related loan. Our target credit investments will typically have maturities between three and seven years, and we anticipate that many of our debt investments will have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically will not fully pay down principal prior to maturity. 
 We anticipate that many of our debt investments will typically not fully pay down principal prior to maturity and have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis, usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and any other alternative reference rates which may affect our net investment income over the long term and increase the risk of losing part or all of the investment. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. To the extent a preferred equity contains PIK provisions, PIK dividends, computed at the contractual rates, are accrued and recorded as dividend income and added to the principal balance of the preferred equity. PIK dividends added to the principal balance are generally collected upon redemption of the equity. 
 Our investment transactions will also reflect the proceeds from repayment or sales of investments. We will recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, incentive fee, expenses reimbursable under the agreements between us and our Adviser, including an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement and an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement ), legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses, offering and organization expenses, and other operating expenses. 
 36 

We expect, but cannot ensure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods. 
 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 Portfolio Composition 
 Below is a summary of certain characteristics of our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These calculations include all debt investments, as applicable, for which fair value is determined by the Adviser, in conjunction with third-party valuation firms, and excludes non-accrual assets. Amounts are weighted based on fair market value of each respective investment. Portfolio company information utilized in certain calculations was derived from the most recently available portfolio company financial statements, which has not been independently reviewed by us, and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. Accordingly, we make no representation or warranty in respect of this information. Revenues, EBITDA, gross margins, and EBITDA margins reported by our portfolio companies and used in the calculations below are generally for the trailing twelve-month period. 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Number of investments 64 24 Number of portfolio companies 28 16 Weighted average loan-to-value LTV (1)

 0.0 0.0 
 
 (1) LTV is the ratio of total debt minus cash, divided by the estimated enterprise value or value of the underlying collateral of the portfolio company. Total debt only includes the debt issued through the tranche in which we are a lender and excludes any debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration the contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. Value represents an estimate of enterprise value of each portfolio company, a calculation that will vary by portfolio company. 
 (2) Gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue of the portfolio company. Excludes one portfolio company investment where gross margin is not reported by the portfolio company. 
 (3) EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by total revenue of the portfolio company. Excludes three portfolio company investments where EBITDA margin may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk as the investments were underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue as opposed to EBITDA. 
 (4) YTM is calculated based on the amortized cost and contractual interest rate for the investment at the end of the applicable reporting period, and assumes the investment is held until the sooner of actual maturity or a three-year assumed life with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. 
 (5) Primarily subject to interest rate floors.

 (1) The investment income yield is calculated as (a) the actual amount earned on earning debt investments, including interest and fee income and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the weighted average of total earning debt investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of our first-lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser has developed risk assessment policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as Internal Risk Ratings. Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 to 4, which ratings are defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Key drivers of internal risk ratings include financial metrics, financial covenants, liquidity and enterprise value coverage. 
 Internal Risk Ratings Definitions 
 Rating Description 1 Investments with a grade of 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 
 2 Investments with a grade of 2 involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and/or unchanged; and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. There is no concern about repayment of both interest and our costs basis. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2. 
 3 Investments with a grade of 3 indicate that the portfolio company is performing materially below expectations and the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of other factors such as non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. 
 4 Investments with a grade 4 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
 
 40 

Our Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the risk ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Our Adviser reviews our investment ratings in connection with our quarterly valuation process. The below table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings assigned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our investment portfolio was 1.89 and 1.92, respectively. 
 Warehousing Transaction 
 On June 20, 2023, the Adviser entered into a facility agreement (the Facility Agreement with a subsidiary of Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund (the Financing Provider ), an independent third party, to allow the Company to acquire portfolio investments Warehoused Assets by purchasing all or a portion of certain loans, together with any unfunded commitments therein and/or equity instruments owned and held by the Financing Provider pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Facility Agreement (the Warehousing Transaction ). The Warehousing Transaction was designed to assist us in deploying capital upon receipt of subscriptions. 
 The Facility Agreement was terminated on June 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased one debt investment from the Financing Provider in one portfolio company for a total cost of 6,557. As of December 31, 2023, the Financing Provider held debt investments in two portfolio companies. 
 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful. As we did not commence investing activities until the fourth calendar quarter of 2023, there were no investments or investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 First-lien debt 8,995 - 18,969 - Total Investment Income 8,995 - 18,969 - 
 Interest income on our debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024 , there were no debt investments on non-accrual status. 
 Total investment income increased from 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the increase in our investment portfolio from 0 at December 31, 2023 to 359.0 million at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, there were no investments. Total investment income increased from 780 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023 to 9.0 million for the three months ended 
 41 

September 30, 2024, primarily due to the increase in our investment portfolio from 104.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 359.0 million at September 30, 2024. Our weighted average investment income yield on total investments at amortized cost and fair value was 11.3 and 11.3 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 10.6 and 10.6 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the weighted average yield on total investments was primarily due to the purchase of investments with higher base rates.

Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We intend to elect to be treated and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. 
 If we fail to distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year (to the extent that income tax was not imposed on such amounts) less certain over-distributions in prior years (together, the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements ), we will be liable for a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the portion of the undistributed amounts of such income that are less than the amounts required to be distributed based on the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). We currently intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. 
 We did not incur any excise tax expense for any of the periods presented. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of capital drawdowns of our privately placed capital commitments, (ii) cash flows from our operations, (iii) any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future and (iv) any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. We may fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities. Our primary use of cash will be for (a) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (b) the cost of operations (including paying the Adviser), (c) debt service of any borrowings, (d) cash distributions to the holders of our common stock and (e) repurchases of our common stock. We believe our current cash position and net cash provided by operating activities, along with capital drawdowns from the private offering of our common stock and borrowings from financial institutions, will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs that may arise at our portfolio companies, for the next 12 months and beyond. 
 On November 14, 2023, we entered into a 200.0 million revolving credit facility (the SMBC Credit Facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation SMBC ). Borrowings under the SMBC Credit Facility may be base rate loans, eurocurrency loans or risk-free rate loans (i.e., loans bearing interest based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate SONIA )). For any base rate loan, the applicable margin will be 1.60 plus the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points (0.50 ); (b) the prime rate; or (c) except during any period during which the applicable SOFR rate is unavailable, the applicable SOFR rate in effect on such day plus 105 basis points (1.05 ). Eurocurrency rate loans, daily simple SOFR loans, daily simple SONIA loans and term SOFR loans will accrue interest at a rate equal to one-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR ), SOFR, or SONIA or one-month term SOFR, respectively, plus, in each case, 2.60 . The Company will pay to SMBC an unused commitment fee, payable quarterly, equal to 0.35 per annum of the average unused portion of available borrowings under the SMBC Credit Facility. 
 Our obligations under the SMBC Credit Facility are secured by (a) our ability to call capital from stockholders, (b) the capital commitments and capital contributions of stockholders and (c) the bank accounts to which such capital contributions are funded into by stockholders. We have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. Borrowings under the SMBC Credit Facility are subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act, as amended. 
 On June 26, 2024 (the Effective Date ), we entered into a 200.0 million loan financing and servicing agreement (the DB Credit Facility with Deutsche Bank AG through our wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary, VCSL Funding 1 LLC VCSL Funding 1 ). The period during which VCSL Funding 1 may request drawdowns under the DB Credit Facility (the Revolving Period commenced on the Effective Date and will continue through June 26, 2027 unless there is an earlier termination or event of default. The DB Credit Facility will mature on the earliest of (i) two years from the last day of the Revolving Period, (ii) the date on which the Company ceases to exist or (iii) the occurrence of an event of 
 44 

default. During the Revolving Period, borrowings under the DB Credit Facility will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the base rate plus 2.40 per annum. Following expiration of the Revolving Period, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the DB Credit Facility will equal the base rate plus 2.90 per annum for the remaining term of the DB Credit Facility. The base rate under the DB Credit Facility is three-month SOFR. A facility agent fee is payable to the facility agent each quarter and is calculated based on the aggregate commitments outstanding each day during the preceding collection period at a rate of 1/360 of 0.25 of the aggregate commitments on each day. 
 The DB Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by VCSL Funding 1. VCSL Funding 1 has made customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. Our borrowings, including those under the DB Credit Facility, are subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act. 
 Although we believe that we will remain in compliance, there are no assurances that we will continue to comply with the covenants in the SMBC Credit Facility and the DB Facility (collectively the Credit Facilities ), as applicable. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under one or both of the Credit Facilities that, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lenders, could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the one or both of the Credit Facilities, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, to the extent that we cannot meet our financing obligations, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations. In such an event, we may be forced to sell assets at significantly depressed prices due to market conditions or otherwise, which may result in losses. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there was 35.3 million and 157.0 million outstanding under the SMBC Credit Facility and DB Facility, respectively, and we were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of our Credit Facilities. For more information on the Credit Facilities, see Note 5. Borrowings, to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 31.0 million and 61.9 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by (30.9) million. During that period, (254.4) million was used in operating activities, primarily due to investment purchases of (280.3) million, offset by 22.2 million in repayments of investments in portfolio companies. During the same period, 223.4 million was provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of common shares of 113.8 million and net proceeds from secured borrowings of 115.0 million. In accordance with the 1940 Act, the Company is currently only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing. Asset coverage ratio per unit is the ratio of the carrying value of our total consolidated assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness. Asset coverage ratio per unit is expressed in terms of dollar amounts per 1,000 of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, asset coverage was 198.0 and the asset coverage per unit was 1,980.

 Dividends and Distributions 
 To the extent that we have taxable income available, we intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the applicable record date. The amount to be distributed to stockholders is determined by our Board each quarter and is generally based upon the taxable earnings 
 46 

estimated by management and available cash. Net realized capital gains, if any, will generally be distributed at least annually, although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders will automatically receive dividends and other distributions in cash unless they elect to have their dividends and other distributions reinvested in additional shares. As a result of the foregoing, if our Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or distribution, stockholders that have opted in to our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares rather than receiving cash. 
 The following table summarizes the Company s distributions declared from inception through September 30, 2024:

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser pursuant to the 1940 Act to provide us with investment advisory services, and an Administration Agreement with the Administrator to provide us with administrative services. For more information about payments for services provided under these agreements, see Note 4. Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into contracts or agreements that contain indemnification or warranties. Future events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against us. We believe that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023, for any such exposure.

We currently are and may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as revolving credit facilities, bridge financing commitments, or delayed draw commitments. 
 We had the following unfunded commitments to fund delayed draw and revolving senior secured loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 :

 Warehousing Transaction 
 The Facility Agreement was terminated on June 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased the entire commitment and par balance outstanding on Enverus Holdings Inc. for 6.6 million from the Financing Provider.

 1 The investment bears interest at rates that may be determined by reference to SOFR, which resets monthly. 
 2 The negative amortized cost is the result of the capitalized discount on the loan or the unfunded commitment being valued below par. The negative amortized cost is the result of the capitalized discount being greater than the principal amount outstanding on the loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024, due to the expiration of the Facility Agreement, the Facility Provider did not hold any debt investments. As of December 31, 2023, the Warehoused Assets had 2.7 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments on revolvers and delay draw term loans. There is no guarantee that these amounts will be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers, subject to the terms of each loan s respective credit agreement. 
 Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 the Administration Agreement; 
 the Expense Support Agreement; and 
 the License Agreement. 
 In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we rely on exemptive relief that has been granted to us and certain of our affiliates to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain affiliates, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Finally, the Adviser is sponsoring a program whereby investors who purchase shares of Common Stock from the Company between November 4, 2024 and June 30, 2025 will be granted additional shares of 
 48 

Common Stock. See Note 4. Related Party Transactions, to the consolidate financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 One of the critical accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 ), as amended, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below: 
 Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
 Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. 
 In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Adviser will apply a valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we will evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we will subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), will review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 49 

In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts, amortization of premiums and PIK interest. Discounts from and premiums to par value on investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. To the extent loans contain PIK provisions, PIK interest, computed at the contractual rates is accrued and recorded as interest income and added to the principal balance of the loan. PIK interest income added to the principal balance is generally collected upon repayment of the outstanding principal. 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when interest and/or principal payments become materially past due and there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Recognition of interest income of that loan will be ceased until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. However, we remain contractually entitled to this interest. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon our judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid or there is no longer any reasonable doubt that such principal or interest will be collected in full and, in our judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value or is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written-off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected, and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. 
 Investment Transactions 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. 
 Other income may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, unused, and prepayment fees associated with our investment activities, as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by us to its portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. 
 Income Taxes 
 We intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. 
 If we fail to comply with the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements, we will be liable for a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the portion of the undistributed amounts of such income that are less than the amounts required to be distributed based on the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. For this purpose, however, any net ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). We currently intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. 
 Recent Developments 
 On November 4, 2024, the Company declared a dividend for our common stock of 0.14 per share, payable on November 11, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 4, 2024. 
 50 

Effective October 4, 2024, the Company decreased the borrowing capacity under the SMBC Credit Facility from 200.0 million to 100.0 million. The other material terms of the SMBC Credit Facility remained unchanged. 

51 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We plan to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with valuation policy and procedures established by our Board. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend in part upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds as well as our level of leverage. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets. 
 We may hedge against interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or a credit facility subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currencies, such activities may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to the portion of our portfolio of investments, if any, with fixed interest rates or denominated in foreign currencies. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on a fair value basis, approximately 0 of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate and approximately 100 of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate. Additionally, our Credit Facilities are also subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating SOFR rates. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes of the net cash flow generated from interest income and expenses (in thousands), should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of the Credit Facilities, using the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest expense on the Credit Facilities is calculated using the interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, adjusted for the impact of hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. The base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain unchanged from the actual effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table (dollar amounts in thousands). 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, the following table shows the annualized net interest income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 Changes in Interest Rates Interest Income Interest Expense Net Interest Income -100 Basis Points 16,831 5,903 10,927 -200 Basis Points 14,978 5,037 9,941 -300 Basis Points 13,125 4,171 8,954 +100 Basis Points 20,536 7,636 12,900 +200 Basis Points 22,388 8,502 13,887 +300 Basis Points 24,241 9,368 14,873
