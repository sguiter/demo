satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain restrictions on our operations,

Forward-Looking
Statements 

Statements
in the following discussion and throughout this report that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements. 
You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as expect, anticipate, estimate, 
 may, will, should, intend, believe, and similar expressions, although
not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Although we believe the expectations reflected in these forward-looking
statements are reasonable, such statements are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties and we can give no assurances
that our expectations will prove to be correct. Actual results could differ materially from those described in this report because of
numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation, those risk factors discussed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on April 15, 2024. We undertake
no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect
actual outcomes. 

Overview 

We
were incorporated on June 5, 2014, under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a consulting firm that provides business development
and consulting services to start-up and development-stage companies. Our business model is to provide businesses in various industries
with customized consulting services to meet their business needs and help them improve their business models, sales and marketing plans
and internal operations, as well as introduce these businesses to experienced professional contacts that would be vital to the success
of these companies. 

The
Company is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act and
does not engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. The Company is not managed like an active
investment vehicle, is not an investment company registered under the 1940 Act and is not required to register under the 1940 Act. 

Additionally,
in accordance with the 1940 Act, Section 3(c)(1), the Company is not an Investment Company as defined by the 1940 Act because the Company
does not have outstanding securities beneficially owned by more than one hundred persons and, at this time, the Company is not making
and does not presently propose to make a public offering of its securities. Additionally, the Company has not and has no plans to purchase
or acquire any securities issued by any registered investment company. 

Our
business focuses on providing advisement services to entrepreneurs and assisting business owners so that their ideas can be fully developed
and implemented. Due to limited resources, lack of experienced management and competing priorities, start-up and developmental stage
companies are not operating as efficiently as they can be, and therefore would benefit from an outside party that could assist in developing
and executing certain strategies. We utilize our knowledge in developing businesses, share practical experiences with our clients and
introduce the business owners to experienced professionals who could help these inexperienced entrepreneurs further implement their ideas.
Start-ups and development stage businesses across all industries commonly experience these certain growing pains . 

18 

Plan
of Operations 

Our
plan is to prepare our clients for the many inevitable challenges they will encounter and to develop a customized plan for them to overcome
these obstacles, so that they can focus on marketing their product(s) and/or service(s) to their potential customers. 

Although
we ve only worked with three clients since inception, our goal is to add and service a minimum of two to three new clients between
now and the end of 2024. We re marketing our services through both personal contact and online by (a) mining our existing network
of professional contacts via personal outreach programs, which will also target international prospects that may wish to enter the US
market; (b) expanding our network by attending targeted conferences and professional gatherings; and (c) utilizing our website at www.balancelabs.co,
plus engaging potential clients on social media, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. However, because we have a limited budget
allocated for an on-line marketing campaign, we anticipate that professionals within our professional network and personal referrals
from companies that are satisfied with our professional services are likely to be our most significant and efficient near-term form of
marketing. 

We
believe that we can support our clients with our existing full-time staff, supplemented with part-time sub-contracted professionals and
service providers, as necessary. Between now and the end of 2024, we intend to formalize our relationships with these subcontractors
so that we can offer our clients turn-key business development products and services. 

Our
primary requirement for funding is for working capital in order to accommodate temporary negative cash flows from operations (see Liquidity
and Capital Resources ).

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following: 

September 30, 2024 
 December 31, 2023 

(Unaudited) 

Cash 
 30,407 
 112,809 
 
 Working capital (deficiency) 
 4,953,363 
 4,542,883 

Availability
of Additional Funds 

Except
for the monthly consulting fee to our CEO and Chairman of the Board and the monthly lease of our virtual office, as described elsewhere
in this report, we currently do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. We are actively pursuing new client relationships.
Even if we were to add a new client(s), due to our current lack of a diversified client base, there could be temporary imbalances between
cash receipts and cash operating expenditures, which means that we may need additional capital. The engagement revenues associated with
most client engagements will self-fund the in-house and sub-contractor services we need in order to supply products and services to our
clients. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficiency of 4,953,363 and used cash in operations of 112,402. In addition,
the Company is working to manage its current liabilities while it continues to make changes in operations to further improve its cash
flow and liquidity position. 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

We
experienced negative cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, in the amount of
 112,402 and 89,693, respectively. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 0 and 0, respectively. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 30,000 and 0, respectively. 

Our
Auditors Have Issued a Going Concern Opinion 

The
Company s independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern as of September 30, 2024. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report on Form 10-Q have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, these conditions raise substantial doubt from the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in the notes to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

21 

The
Company anticipates the receipt of funding within such period, but there can be no assurance that it will occur. If the Company is unable
to meet its internal revenue forecasts or obtain additional financing on a timely basis, it may have to delay vendor payments and/or
initiate cost reductions, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations, and ultimately it could be forced to discontinue the Company s operations, liquidate, and/or seek reorganization
under the U.S. bankruptcy code. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will
be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain restrictions
on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Estimates may include those pertaining to accruals, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could materially
differ from those estimates. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company accounts for revenues under FASB ASC 606, which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be
recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected
to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all the
five following criteria are met: (1) Identify the Contract with a Customer, (2) Identify the Performance Obligations in the Contract,
(3) Determine the Transaction Price, (4) Allocate the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations in the Contract, and (5) Recognize
Revenue When (or As) the Entity Satisfies a Performance Obligation. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash,
accounts payable, and the short-term portion of long-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 

We
adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). This standard defines fair value, provides
guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but
rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to
measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market
prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity
of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 

Level
 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets
 or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by
 us, which reflect those that a market participant would use. 

22 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

We
have implemented all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact our consolidated financial statements and do not believe
that there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations. 

In
August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity; Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ),
as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or
improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes
from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component,
unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium.
As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity and
will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method
when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company s current
accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the
fiscal year. The Company has adopted this standard. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

The
Company s assessment identified certain material weaknesses, (i) functional controls, (ii) lack of audit committee and (iii) segregation
of duties. Because of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. The Company does
not have an audit committee and therefore there is no independent review and independent oversight over the Company s financial
reporting. 

There
is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company s management is composed of a small number
of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would
need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain
optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter at end of the fiscal year to determine whether improvement in segregation
of duty is feasible. 

23 

Accordingly,
as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the
Company s internal controls. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our small size.
Management believes these weaknesses did not have a material effect on our financial results and intends to take remedial actions upon
receiving funding for the Company s business operations. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report herein. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act,
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

not be the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently
deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

There
were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 15, 2024.
