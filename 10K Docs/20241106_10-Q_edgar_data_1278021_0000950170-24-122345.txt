and are derived from trading-related fees and commissions and revenues from products and services. The Company continually monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for credit losses is based on the estimated expected credit losses in accounts receivable, as determined from a review of aging schedules, past due balances, historical collection experience and other specific collection issues that have been identified. Account balances are grouped for evaluation based on various risk characteristics, including billing type, legal entity, and geographic region. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged to bad debt expense, which is included in general and administrative expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Balances that are determined to be uncollectable are written off against the allowance for credit losses .

 revenue streams as described below. Commission Revenue The Company charges its broker-dealer clients variable transaction fees for trades executed on its platforms and, under certain plans, distribution fees or monthly minimum fees to use the platforms for a particular product area. Variable transaction fees are recognized on a trade date basis, are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platforms and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded, as well as individual client incentives. Bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities generally generate lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions. Under the Company s disclosed trading transaction fee plans, variable transaction fees, distribution fees and unused monthly fee commitments are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis. For Open Trading trades that the Company executes between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, the Company earns its commission through the difference in price between the two trades. The commission is collected upon settlement of the trade, which typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. For the majority of the Company s U.S. Treasury matched principal trades, commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis. Following its acquisition of Pragma LLC and Pragma Financial Systems LLC (collectively, Pragma in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also earns other commissions on equities and foreign exchange products for algorithmic trading services. These fees incorporate variable transaction fees, which are calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume traded and are billed on a monthly basis.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expects, intends, anticipates, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, will, or words of similar meaning and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for our future business and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections and beliefs upon which we base our expectations may change prior to the end of each quarter or the year. Although these expectations may change, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained in this report, except to the extent required by applicable law. Our Company s policy is generally to provide our expectations only once per quarter, and not to update that information until the next quarter. Actual future events or results may differ, perhaps materially from those contained in the projections or forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the section captioned Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Executive Overview 
 MarketAxess operates leading electronic trading platforms delivering greater trading efficiency, a diversified pool of liquidity and significant cost savings to our clients across the global fixed-income markets. Over 2,000 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms use our patented trading technology to efficiently trade U.S. high-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, emerging market debt, Eurobonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds and other fixed-income securities. Our award-winning Open Trading marketplace is widely regarded as the preferred all-to-all trading solution in the global credit markets, creating a unique liquidity pool for a broad range of credit market participants. We leverage our diverse set of trading protocols, automated and algorithmic trading solutions, intelligent data and index products and a range of post-trade services to provide an end-to-end trading solution to our robust network of platform participants. 
 We provide automated and algorithmic trading solutions that we believe, when combined with our integrated and actionable data offerings, will help our clients make faster, better-informed decisions on when and how to trade on our platforms. In 2023, we introduced X-Pro, our newest trading platform, to more seamlessly combine our trading protocols with our proprietary data and pre-trade analytics. We expect that our recent acquisition of Pragma, a quantitative trading technology provider specializing in algorithmic and analytical trading services, will accelerate our development of artificial intelligence driven execution algorithms across many of our key product areas. 
 We operate in a large and growing market that provides us with a significant opportunity for future growth, due, in part, to the relatively low levels of electronic trading in many of our largest current product areas. We offer Open Trading for most of our products in order to capitalize on this addressable market by increasing the number of potential trading counterparties and providing our clients with a menu of solutions at each step in the trading process. We believe that Open Trading drives meaningful price improvement for our clients and reduces risk in fixed-income markets by creating a global, diversified pool of liquidity whereby our institutional investor, dealer and alternative liquidity provider clients can all interact on an anonymous basis. Institutional investors can also send trading inquiries directly to their traditional broker-dealer counterparties on a disclosed basis, while simultaneously accessing additional counterparties through our anonymous Open Trading solutions. 
 We also provide a number of integrated and actionable data offerings, including CP+ and Axess All , to assist clients with real-time pricing and trading decisions and transaction cost analysis. We have a range of post-trade services, including straight-through processing, post-trade matching, trade publication, regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across fixed-income and other products. 
 We derive revenue from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms, information services, post-trade services and technology services. Our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising, clearing costs and general and administrative expenses. 
 Our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platforms for fixed-income securities, connecting broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently, while offering a broad array of trading information and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle. The key elements of our strategy are discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business Our Strategy of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 28 

Critical Factors Affecting Our Industry and Our Company 
 Economic, Political and Market Factors 
 The global fixed-income securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic, political and market factors that may impact trading volume. These factors could have a material adverse or positive effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include, among others, credit market conditions, the current interest rate environment, including the volatility of interest rates and investors forecasts of future interest rates, the duration of bonds traded, economic and political conditions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and the consolidation or contraction of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the market backdrop for the Company continued to improve with strong increases in estimated U.S. credit market volumes, a modest increase in credit spread volatility relative to second quarter 2024 levels, and an increase in the velocity of trading in U.S. high-grade. U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield market average daily trading volume increased 39.4 and 22.6 , respectively, and U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield new issuance increased 41.2 and 89.7 to 403.9 billion and 74.3 billion, respectively. In addition, while credit spread volatility remained at historically low levels, it was higher in the quarter than in the first half of 2024. Furthermore, in advance of the Federal Reserve cutting rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, clients increased their activity in longer duration bonds traded in U.S. high-grade, which benefited our U.S. high-grade average variable fee per million. 
 A strong new issue calendar, which we have seen in recent periods, and low levels of credit spread volatility can contribute to a decrease in exchange-trade fund ETF market maker activity on our platforms, as the increased availability of new issues may lead to reduction in secondary market trading, especially in U.S. high-yield. A strong new issue calendar can also negatively impact our market share in the short-term, but is expected to positively impact secondary trading volumes over the long term. The decrease in U.S. high-yield activity during the quarter negatively impacted our total credit average variable fee per million, but the increase in higher duration bonds traded in U.S. high-grade positively impacted our total credit average variable fee per million. 
 On the international side of our business, Eurobonds and emerging markets estimated market volumes have increased significantly compared to the prior year. Emerging markets estimated market volumes have been particularly strong relative to prior years, driven by a more favorable macroeconomic outlook in developed markets, reflecting easing concerns over inflation and the lower probability of an economic recession. 
 Because the majority of our assets are short-term in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation impacts our expenses, such as employee compensation, technology and communications expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services. To the extent inflation continues to result in high interest rates or has other adverse effects on the securities markets or the economy, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 
 We expect that current cash and investment balances, in combination with cash flows that are generated from operations and the ability to borrow under our 2023 Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We ended the quarter with 749.9 million in available borrowing capacity under the 2023 Credit Agreement and capital significantly in excess of our regulatory requirements. 
 Competitive Landscape 
 The global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage, in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Sources of competition for us will continue to include, among others, bond trading conducted directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multi-dealer or all-to-all trading platforms. Competitors, including companies in which some of our broker-dealer clients have invested, have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us. 
 We primarily compete on the basis of our client network, the liquidity provided by our dealer, and, to a lesser extent, institutional investor clients, the total transaction costs and fees associated with our services, the breadth of products, protocols and services offered, as well as the quality, reliability, security and ease of use of our platforms. We believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors. 
 There has been increased demand for portfolio trading workflows over the last few years, which has resulted in heightened competition among trading platforms to enhance their portfolio trading offerings and expand them across different geographies and products. During periods of relatively lower credit spread volatility, clients have been using portfolio trading workflows in lieu of more established trading protocols designed to generate price competition on individual bonds. Our dealer clients have also increased their usage of matching sessions offered by competing platforms in recent periods. To the extent that our clients increase their use of portfolio trading and matching session protocols offered by other platforms, our market share in those products could decrease. Due to the large size of the trades and the concentration of activity at the end of the month, portfolio trading can drive significant swings in trading volumes and estimated market share. 
 29 

Our competitive position is enhanced by the unique liquidity provided by our Open Trading functionalities and the integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platforms and other systems. We have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platforms, working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 Our business is subject to extensive regulations in the United States and internationally, which may expose us to significant regulatory risk and cause additional legal costs to ensure compliance. The existing legal framework that governs the financial markets is periodically reviewed and amended, resulting in the enactment and enforcement of new laws and regulations that apply to our business. In January 2022, the SEC proposed rules that will expand Regulation ATS and Regulation SCI to alternative trading systems (ATS) that trade government securities and amend the SEC rule regarding the definition of an exchange to include Communication Protocol Systems, such as our request-for-quote protocols. Based on these proposed rules, we expect that we will have to operate all of our trading protocols in compliance with Regulation ATS and we could become subject to Regulation SCI for certain parts of our business in the future. The SEC also recently adopted final rules regarding the central clearing of certain secondary market transactions involving U.S. Treasury securities, which will become effective for certain cash market transactions on December 31, 2025 and repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions on June 30, 2026. This central clearing mandate will impact certain of our participants who do not centrally clear such trades today and some of our investor clients have expressed concerns about using platforms that will require the clearing of any resultant trades executed on such platforms. The impact of any of these reform efforts on us and our operations remains uncertain. 
 As a result of the U.K. s departure from the E.U. in 2020 (commonly referred to as Brexit ), we obtained authorizations from the AFM for our subsidiaries in the Netherlands in 2019. We now provide regulated services to our clients within the E.U. in reliance on the cross-border services passport held by our Dutch subsidiaries. Brexit has led to an ongoing divergence between the U.K. and E.U. financial regulations, which has made it more difficult and costly to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject. The cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes has increased and is likely to continue to increase in the future. 
 Compliance with regulations may require us to dedicate additional financial and operational resources, which may adversely affect our profitability. For example, the E.U. s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which will become applicable to portions of our business in 2025, will require us to dedicate additional financial and operational resources to meet the significant additional information communication technologies services-related governance, risk management, resilience testing and sub-contracting requirements created by the legislation. However, we also believe new regulations may increase demand for our platforms and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from those regulatory changes that cause market participants to seek electronic trading platforms that meet the various regulatory requirements. 
 For further description of the regulations which govern our business, see Part1, Item I. Business Government Regulation of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Technology Environment 
 We must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms. The markets in which we compete are characterized by increasingly complex protocols, systems and technology infrastructure requirements. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services, develop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective broker-dealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. For example, in 2023, we introduced MarketAxess X-Pro, our new trading platform, which provides traders with a flexible user experience, intuitive workflows and access to our proprietary data and pre-trade analytics. We plan to continue to focus on technology infrastructure initiatives and improving our platforms with the goal of further enhancing our leading market position. 
 As the overall share of electronic trading grows in global credit products, we are experiencing continued demand for, and growth in, our automated and algorithmic trading solutions. We also support a large and growing base of dealer market making algorithms. In the third quarter of 2024, trading volumes in Auto-X, one of our automated trading protocols, rose to 96.1 billion, an increase of 27.6 from 75.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Trade count on Auto-X increased 36.6 to approximately 612,000 from approximately 448,000 in the third quarter of 2023. There were 249 active client firms using Auto-X in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 49.1 from the prior year. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, dealer algorithmic responses on our platforms increased 24.3 from the third quarter of 2023 to 10.2 million. 
 We experience cybersecurity threats and incidents from time to time. However, as of the date of this report, MarketAxess has not experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that has materially affected the Company in at least the past three years. Cybersecurity incidents could impact revenue and operating income and increase costs. We therefore continue to make investments in our cybersecurity infrastructure and training of employees, which may result in increased costs, to strengthen our cybersecurity measures.

Trends in Our Business 
 The majority of our revenue is derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms between and among our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients and monthly distribution fees. We believe that the following are the key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platforms and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us: 

the number of participants on our platforms and their willingness to use our platforms instead of competitors' platforms or other execution methods; 

the frequency and competitiveness of the price responses by participants on our platforms; 

the number of markets that are available for our clients to trade on our platforms; 

the overall level of activity in these markets; 

the duration of the bonds trading on our platforms; and 

the particular fee plan and protocol under which we earn commissions and distribution fees. 

We believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates, the direction of interest rate movements, the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus U.S. Treasury securities. Because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platforms, it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes, regardless of the cause of such decline, would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability. 
 As further described under Critical Factors Affecting our Industry and our Company Economic, Political and Market Factors, Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023, our trading volumes increased and our average variable transaction fee per million decreased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Commission Revenue 
 Commissions are recognized on a trade date basis, are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platforms and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded, as well as individual client incentives. Bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions. 
 For Open Trading trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades. For the majority of U.S. Treasury matched principal trades, commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis. 
 Credit Commissions. Credit includes U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, high-yield bonds, emerging markets bonds, Eurobonds, municipal bonds and leveraged loans. Our U.S. high-grade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. Certain broker-dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. Under these fee plans, we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the broker-dealer client. The U.S. high-grade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and, as a result, is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded. 
 Commissions for high-yield bonds, emerging markets bonds, Eurobonds, municipal bonds and leveraged loans generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules. Our high-yield fee plan structure is similar to our U.S. high-grade fee plans. Certain dealers participate in a high-yield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and a fixed distribution fee, while other dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. 
 The average credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield, years-to-maturity and nominal size of high-grade bonds traded on our platforms and changes in product mix or trading protocols. 
 Credit distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans. 
 Rates Commissions. Rates includes U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and European government bonds. Commissions for rates products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded. U.S. Treasury fee plans are typically volume tiered and can vary based on the trading protocol. The average rates fee per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols. 
 31 

We anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future. Consequently, past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions. 
 Other Commissions. Other commissions include equities and foreign exchange commissions for Pragma s algorithmic trading services. Commissions for equities and foreign exchange are volume-tiered and consist of variable transaction fees that are billed monthly. 
 
 Information Services 
 We generate revenue from data licensed to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers; professional and consulting services; technology software licenses; and maintenance and support services. These revenues are either for subscription-based services transferred over time, and may be net of volume-based discounts, or one-time services. Revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period while revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided. Customers are generally billed monthly, quarterly, or annually; revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period. 
 Post-trade Services 
 We generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting, trade publication and post-trade matching services. Customers are generally billed in the current month or monthly in arrears and revenue is recognized in the period that the transactions are processed. Revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period. We also generate one-time implementation fees for onboarding clients, which are invoiced and recognized in the period the implementation is complete. 
 Technology Services 
 Technology services includes technology services revenue generated by Pragma and revenue generated from telecommunications line charges to broker-dealer clients. 
 Expenses 
 In the normal course of business, we incur the following expenses: 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits. Employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries, stock-based compensation costs, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and payroll taxes. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. We depreciate our computer hardware and related software, office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straight-line basis over three to five years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. Intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 15 years, using either a straight-line or accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefit that we expect to realize from such assets. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. 
 Technology and Communications. Technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to software and licenses, maintenance on software and hardware, cloud hosting costs, data feeds provided by outside vendors, U.S. government bonds technology platform licensing fees, data center hosting costs and our internal network connections. The majority of our broker-dealer clients have dedicated high-speed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. We charge our broker-dealer clients a monthly fee for these connections, which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur. 
 Professional and Consulting Fees. Professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees, legal fees and fees paid to information technology and other consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platforms, information and post-trade services products and other services. 
 Occupancy. Occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent, utilities and commercial rent tax. 
 Marketing and Advertising. Marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of branding and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services. This expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industry-sponsored seminars, conferences and conventions, and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platforms, information services and post-trade services. 
 Clearing Costs. Clearing costs consist of fees that we are charged by third-party clearing brokers and depositories for the clearing and settlement of matched principal trades, regulatory reporting fees and variable transaction fees assessed by the provider of our third-party middle office system. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment, board of directors expenses, regulatory fees, subscription costs, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts, various state franchise and U.K. value-added taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. 
 32 

Expenses may continue to grow in the future, notably in employee compensation and benefits as we increase headcount to support investment in new products, operational support and geographic expansion, depreciation and amortization due to increased investment in new products and enhancements to our trading platforms, and technology and communication costs. Expenses may also grow due to increased regulatory complexity, acquisitions or the continued effects of inflation. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest Income . Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, deposits and investments. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense consists of financing charges incurred on short-term borrowings. 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate represents the proportionate share of our equity method investee's net income. 
 Other, Net. Other, net consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading security investments and foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, investment advisory fees, credit facility administrative fees, gains or losses on revaluations of contingent consideration payable and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting estimates for us include stock-based compensation. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 We maintain the 2020 Plan, which provides for the grant of full value awards, stock options and other stock-based awards to encourage employees, consultants and non-employee directors to participate in our long-term success. We make critical accounting estimates related to performance stock units granted under the 2020 Plan (the PSUs ). 
 In 2022, 2023 and 2024, the PSUs were granted to the executive officers and certain senior managers. Each PSU is earned or forfeited based on our level of achievement of certain predetermined metrics, including pre-tax adjusted operating margin, U.S. credit market share and revenue growth excluding U.S. credit. The vested share pay-out ranges from zero to 200 of the PSU target. The number of PSUs that vest, if any, is determined by the level of achievement of the performance metrics during the three-year performance periods, as certified by the Compensation and Talent Committee following the conclusion of the performance period. In addition, participants must provide continued service through the vesting date, subject to death, disability and qualified retirement exceptions, as applicable. Compensation expense for the PSUs is measured using the fair value of our stock at the grant date and estimates of future performance and actual share payouts. Each period, we make estimates of the current expected share payouts and adjust the life-to-date compensation expense recognized since the grant date. As of September 30, 2024, a 10.0 change in the expected final share payouts would increase or decrease the life-to-date compensation expense by 1.5 million. The estimated final share payouts for the 2022 and 2023 awards as of September 30, 2024 decreased 25.7 compared to December 31, 2023. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 for a discussion of any recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Segment Results 
 We operate electronic platforms for the trading of fixed-income securities and provide related data, analytics, compliance tools and post-trade services. We consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these products and services, the financial markets in which we compete and our worldwide business activities. We believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain geographic information about our business required by GAAP.

Credit variable transaction fees increased 25.8 million driven by a 28.5 increase in total credit trading volume, partially offset by a 3.8 decrease in total credit average variable transaction fee per million. Open Trading credit volume totaled 265.4 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 31.7 , and Open Trading credit variable transaction fees represented 30.4 and 31.7 of total variable transaction fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rates variable transaction fees increased 1.8 million driven principally by a 48.0 increase in trading volumes, partially offset by a 9.0 decrease in average variable transaction fee per million. Other variable transaction fees include equities and foreign exchange commissions earned by Pragma. 
 Credit fixed distribution fees decreased 2.6 million mainly due to the consolidation of two global dealers and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans.

The 37.8 increase in our U.S. high-grade volume was principally due to an increase in estimated market volumes, partially offset by a decrease in our estimated market share. Estimated U.S. high-grade market volume as reported by FINRA s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine TRACE increased by 41.6 to 2.3 trillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our estimated market share of total U.S. high-grade corporate bond volume decreased to 19.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 20.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We exclude single-dealer portfolio trading activity from our reported U.S. high-grade and high-yield trading volume and estimated market share. Including the impact of single-dealer portfolio trades, our estimated U.S. high-grade market share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.0 , compared to 20.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 U.S. high-yield volume increased by 0.3 mainly due to an increase in estimated market volumes, offset by a decrease in our estimated market share. Our estimated market share of total U.S. high-yield corporate bond volume decreased to 13.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Including the impact of single-dealer portfolio trades, our estimated U.S. high-yield market share was 13.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Emerging markets and Eurobond volumes increased by 21.0 and 29.4 , respectively, mainly due to an increase in estimated market volumes. Other credit volume increased by 49.2 , primarily due to higher municipal bond volume driven by higher estimated market share. Rates trading volume increased 48.0 , primarily due to higher estimated market volumes. 
 Our average variable transaction fee per million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

 Information Services. Information services revenue increased by 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to net new data contract revenue of 0.9 million and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 0.3 million. 
 Post-Trade Services. Post-trade services revenue increased by 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, principally due to net new contract revenue of 0.3 million and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 0.2 million. 
 Technology Services . Technology services revenue increased by 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to technology services revenue generated by Pragma.

Credit variable transaction fees increased 35.3 million driven by a 16.1 increase in trading volume, partially offset by a 5.6 decrease in average variable transaction fee per million. Open Trading credit volume totaled 782.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 10.7 , and Open Trading credit variable transaction fees represented 30.7 and 34.1 of total variable transaction fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rates variable transaction fees increased 1.9 million driven principally by an 11.7 increase in trading volumes. Other variable transaction fees include equities and foreign exchange commissions earned by Pragma. 
 Credit fixed distribution fees decreased 6.1 million mainly due to the consolidation of two global dealers and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans. 
 Our trading volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

For volume reporting purposes, transactions in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars at average monthly rates. 
 The 22.3 increase in our U.S. high-grade volume was principally due to an increase in overall market volumes, partially offset by a decrease in our estimated market share. Estimated U.S. high-grade market volume as reported by TRACE increased by 28.6 to 6.8 trillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our estimated market share of total U.S. high-grade corporate bond volume decreased to 19.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 20.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We exclude single-dealer portfolio trading activity from our reported U.S. high-grade and high-yield trading volume and estimated market share. Including the impact of single-dealer portfolio trades, our estimated U.S. high-grade market share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.6 , compared to 20.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 U.S. high-yield volume decreased by 15.0 , mainly due to a decrease in our estimated market share. Our estimated market share of total U.S. high-yield corporate bond volume decreased to 13.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Including the impact of single-dealer portfolio trades, our estimated U.S. high-yield market share was 13.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Emerging markets and Eurobond volumes increased by 20.2 and 15.2 , respectively, mainly due to increases in estimated market volumes. Other credit volume increased 23.8 , primarily due to higher municipal bonds volume driven by higher estimated market share.

 Information Services. Information services revenue increased by 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to net new data contract revenue of 2.4 million and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 0.5 million. 
 Post-Trade Services. Post-trade services revenue increased by 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, principally due to price increases and net new contract revenue of 1.8 million and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 0.5 million. 
 Technology Services . Technology services revenue increased by 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to technology services revenue generated by Pragma.

 Employee compensation and benefits increased by 26.9 million, primarily due to an increase in salaries, taxes and benefits of 16.7 million on higher employee headcount, largely driven by the Pragma Acquisition, higher employee incentive compensation of 8.5 million and higher stock compensation expense of 1.7 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 4.3 million primarily due to higher amortization of software development costs of 2.5 million and higher amortization of intangibles of 1.9 million. 
 Technology and communications expenses increased by 7.8 million primarily due to higher connectivity costs of 2.6 million, higher software subscription costs of 2.0 million, higher market and production data costs of 1.6 million, higher data center and cloud hosting costs of 0.9 million, higher U.S. Treasury platform licensing fees of 0.5 million and higher IT support costs of 0.3 million.

 41 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand, internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents and corporate bond and U.S. Treasury investments totaled 602.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Our investments generally consist of investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes. 
 In August 2023, we entered into the 2023 Credit Agreement, which provides aggregate commitments totaling 750.0 million, including a revolving credit facility, a 5.0 million letter of credit sub-limit for standby letters of credit and a 380.0 million sub-limit for swingline loans. The 2023 Credit Agreement will mature on August 9, 2026, with our option to request up to two additional 364-day extensions at the discretion of each lender and subject to customary conditions. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.1 million in letters of credit outstanding and 749.9 million in available borrowing capacity under the 2023 Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the alternate base rate or the adjusted term SOFR rate, plus an applicable margin that varies with our consolidated total leverage ratio. The 2023 Credit Agreement requires that we satisfy certain covenants, including a requirement to not exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at September 30, 2024. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the 2023 Credit Agreement. 
 In connection with their self-clearing operations, certain of our operating subsidiaries maintain agreements with a settlement bank to allow the subsidiaries to borrow an aggregate of up to 500.0 million on an uncommitted basis, collateralized by eligible securities pledged by the subsidiaries to the settlement bank, subject to certain haircuts. Borrowings under these agreements will bear interest at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the upper range of the Federal Funds Rate, 0.25 or one-month SOFR, plus 1.00 . As of September 30, 2024, the subsidiaries had no borrowings outstanding and up to 500.0 million in available uncommitted borrowing capacity under such agreements. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements. 
 Under arrangements with their settlement banks, certain of our operating subsidiaries may receive overnight financing in the form of bank overdrafts. As of September 30, 2024, we had no overdrafts payable outstanding. 
 As a result of our self-clearing and settlement activities, we are required to finance certain transactions, maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing broker-dealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the positions financed, cash deposits and customer reserve balances associated with our self-clearing and settlement activities was 240.2 million. These requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity, market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources. 
 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

The 16.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income of 20.6 million, higher depreciation and amortization of 4.3 million, lower prepaid expenses and other assets of 21.4 million, lower purchases of trading investments of 23.7 million and an increase in accrued compensation and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of 10.0 million, partially offset by higher net receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers associated with our clearing activities of 65.8 million. 
 The 11.7 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher net purchases of available-for-sale investments of 5.2 million and higher capital expenditures of 6.5 million. 
 42 

The 45.7 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to higher repurchases of common stock of 58.6 million, higher cash dividends of 2.9 million and lower net proceeds from short-term borrowings of 4.0 million, offset by lower withholding tax payments on full value awards vesting of 5.6 million, lower payments of contingent consideration of 12.5 million and higher exercises of stock options of 1.7 million. 
 The 12.5 million change in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was driven by changes in the cumulative translation adjustment. 
 Past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels. A decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business and financial condition. 
 
 Other Factors Influencing Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and requirements, including commitments for capital expenditures, in the short-term (during the next 12 months). However, our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including liquidity requirements associated with our self-clearing operations and expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue streams. We may also acquire or invest in technologies, business ventures or products that are complementary to our business. In the event we require any additional financing, it will take the form of equity or debt financing. Any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders. Any debt financings, if available at all, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business. In addition, in the long-term (beyond 12 months), we believe our liquidity needs and requirements will be affected by the factors discussed above. 
 Certain of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered as broker-dealers and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and FINRA. These rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the FCA in the U.K. or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement. As of September 30, 2024, each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements. As of September 30, 2024, our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 607.1 million in excess of the required levels of 35.7 million. 
 Each of our U.S. and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally limit, or require the prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity s principal regulator before, the repayment of borrowings from our affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources. 
 We execute securities transactions between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. Our operating subsidiaries settle such transactions using their self-clearing operations or through the use of third-party clearing brokers or settlement agents. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. Under both the self-clearing and the third-party clearing models, we may be exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is an error in executing a matched principal transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements, each third-party clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty s failure on any of our trades. We did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Substantially all of our open securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive transactions as of September 30, 2024 have subsequently settled at the contractual amounts. 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and indemnification provisions. Our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred. 
 We have leases for corporate offices and equipment with initial lease terms ranging from one year to 15 years. We have total future contractual rent payments on these leases of 97.6 million, with 13.1 million due within the next 12 months and 84.5 million due beyond 12 months. 
 We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge our exposure to variability in certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses. As of September 30, 2024, the notional value of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding was 64.1 million and the fair value of the asset was 2.8 million. 
 In January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the 2022 Repurchase Program for up to 150.0 million. In August 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the 2024 Repurchase Program for up to an additional 200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 241.4 million of remaining capacity under the Repurchase Programs. Shares repurchased under the Repurchase Programs will be held in treasury for future use. 
 43 

In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.74 per share payable on December 4, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 20, 2024. Any future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 On April 19, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 49.0 interest in RFQ hub Holdings LLC for approximately 37.9 million of cash consideration. The acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Upon the closing of the acquisition, we will hold a 92.0 controlling stake in RFQ-hub Holdings LLC. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, are important in understanding our operating results. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding our operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business.

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Market Risk 
 The global financial services business is, by its nature, risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the U.S. and global financial services markets, resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 101.2 million of investments in U.S. Treasuries that were classified as trading securities and 55.0 million of investments in corporate bonds that were classified as available-for-sale. Adverse movements, such as a decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities, could result in a substantial loss. A 10.0 decrease in the market value of our U.S Treasuries or available-for-sale investments would result in losses of approximately 10.1 million and 5.5 million, respectively. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash deposits. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash deposits amounted to 600.0 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest income by approximately 6.0 million, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash deposits. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio by approximately 1.0 million, assuming no change in the amount or composition of the investments. The hypothetical unrealized gain or loss of 1.0 million would be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 A similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by approximately 2.6 million. The hypothetical unrealized gain or loss of 2.6 million would be recognized in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 We do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We conduct operations in several different countries outside of the U.S., most notably the U.K., and substantial portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Accordingly, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating expenses, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. 
 During the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 15.7 of our revenues and 24.4 of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, most notably the British Pound Sterling. Based on actual results over the past year, a hypothetical 10.0 increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately 12.7 million and operating expenses by approximately 11.6 million. 
 45 

Credit Risk 
 Through certain of our subsidiaries, we execute securities transactions between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. Our operating subsidiaries settle such transactions using their self-clearing operations or through the use of third-party clearing brokers or settlement agents. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. 
 We are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform, including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk. In connection with Open Trading or other anonymous protocols, we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase. 
 We have policies, procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk. There can be no assurance that these policies, procedures and automated controls will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure. Some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed-income markets, our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third-party sources. Such information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly assessed and interpreted by us. If our risk management procedures fail, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks. 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at three major global banks. Given this concentration, we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at these banks. 
 Derivative Risk 
 Our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market. We use this market to economically hedge our foreign exchange gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations that arise from our U.S. dollar versus British Pound Sterling exposure from the activities of our U.K. subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was 64.1 million. We do not hold derivative instruments for purposes other than economically hedging foreign currency risk.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by MarketAxess in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 identified in connection with the evaluation thereof by our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal P roceedings 
 In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements may be involved in various lawsuits, proceedings and regulatory examinations. We assess liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings, if any, utilizing the latest information available. Based on currently available information, the outcome of our outstanding matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position. It is not presently possible to determine our ultimate exposure to these matters and there is no assurance that the resolution of the outstanding matters will not significantly exceed any reserves accrued by us. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.

 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion of the risk factors affecting the Company, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K.
