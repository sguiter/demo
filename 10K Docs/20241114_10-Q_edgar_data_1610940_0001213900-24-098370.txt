exposure in Capesize Freight Futures contracts, exposure in Panamax Freight
Futures contracts and exposure in Supramax Freight Futures contracts. The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio does not include and BDRY does
not invest in swaps, non-cleared dry bulk freight forwards or other over-the-counter derivative instruments that are not cleared through
exchanges or clearing houses. BDRY may hold exchange-traded options on Freight Futures. The BDRY Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by
Breakwave and will be rebalanced annually. The Freight Futures currently constituting the BDRY Benchmark Portfolio, as well as the daily
holdings of BDRY are available on BDRY s website at www.drybulketf.com. 

When establishing positions in Freight Futures,
BDRY will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately to of the notional value of each Freight Futures
position at the time it is established. These margin requirements are established and subject to change from time to time by the relevant
exchanges, clearing houses or BDRY s Futures Commissions Merchant FCM ), Marex Financial Ltd. (formerly ED F Man
Capital Markets, Inc.) On a daily basis, BDRY is obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the
change in the daily settlement level of its Freight Futures positions. Any assets not required to be posted as margin with the FCM may
be held at BDRY s custodian or remain with the FCM in cash or cash equivalents, as discussed below. 

BDRY was created to provide investors with a cost-effective
and convenient way to gain exposure to daily changes in the price of Freight Futures. BDRY is intended to be used as a diversification
opportunity as part of a complete portfolio, not a complete investment program. 

The Fund will incur certain expenses in connection
with its operations. The Fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries or other high credit quality, short-term fixed-income
or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the Freight futures and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions
that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation
between changes in the Fund s net asset value NAV and changes in the Benchmark Portfolio, because the Benchmark
Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income. The Fund may also realize interest income from its holdings in U.S. Treasuries or other
market rate instruments. 

The Fund seeks to trade its positions prior to
maturity; accordingly, natural market forces may cost the Fund while rebalancing. Each time the Fund seeks to reconstitute its positions,
barring movement in the underlying securities, the futures and option prices may be higher or lower. Such differences in price, barring
a movement in the price of the underlying security, will constitute roll yield and may inhibit the Fund s ability
to achieve its investment objective. 

Several factors determine the total return from
investing in a futures contract position. One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures
contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract
and the next month contract. 

The CTA will close existing positions when it
determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvest the proceeds in other positions. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders
for redemption baskets. 

BWET commenced investment operations on May 3,
2023. BWET commenced trading on NYSE Arca on May 3, 2023 and trades under the symbol BWET. 

BWET s investment objective is to provide
investors with exposure to the daily change in the price of crude oil tanker freight futures, before expenses and liabilities of the Fund,
by tracking the performance of a portfolio (the BWET Benchmark Portfolio mainly consisting of the nearest calendar quarter
of futures contracts on specified indexes (each a Reference Index that measure prices for shipping crude oil Freight
Futures ). Freight Futures reflect market expectations for the future cost of transporting crude oil. Each Reference Index is published
each United Kingdom business day by the London-based Baltic Exchange Ltd. (the Baltic Exchange and measures the charter
rate for crude oil in a specific size category of cargo ship and for a specific route. The two Reference Indexes are as follows: 

The TD3C Index : Persian Gulf to China, 270,000mt cargo (Very Large Crude Carrier or VLCC tankers); 

The TD20 Index: West Africa to Europe, 130,000mt cargo (Suezmax Tankers)

Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
dry bulk spot rates remained generally higher versus the previous year, with the benchmark Baltic Dry Index averaging more than 50 above
the previous year, reaching its highest point early in the quarter before declining and trading in a tight range for the remainder of
the period. 

Geopolitical turmoil remains the main driver
behind the relative outperformance, as the Israel-Hamas conflict and the resulting ship attacks in the Red Sea passage have
rearranged shipping routes in the process lengthening the average trip and leading to significant disruptions across all shipping
segments. For dry bulk, longer sailing distances have also increased demand for ships while bulk commodity flows have also seen
increases versus the previous year. Although dry bulk has not been affected as much as other shipping segments from the ongoing
conflict, spot rates have remained elevated for most of 2024. 

During the three months ended September 2024,
iron ore trade volumes to China remain elevated versus the previous year, as China continued to import record amount of the steelmaking
material despite weakening domestic steel production. As a result, portside inventories of iron ore have increased in tandem. Although
additional stimulus programs have been introduced during the period, the Chinese real estate sector remained in a relatively fragile state
for the third year in a row, and while steel demand for manufacturing has increased, such improvement has been more than offset by weaker
demand for construction. Iron ore prices remained subdued during the period due to the beforementioned demand issues, but late in the
period, the announcement of additional stimulus programs pushed prices briefly back towards the high end of the recent range. Coal volumes
have remained relatively flat versus last year, on a slower pace in growth from China and India offset by weakening flows into Europe. 

The combination of continued strong Chinese bulk
commodity demand combined with global disruptions due to geopolitical conflicts have been supportive for spot rates for dry bulk shipping
leading to the relative outperformance for average spot rates year over year. Spot rate volatility has declined during the period, resulting
in unusual stability in the freight futures market. 

The dry bulk orderbook continue to increase throughout
the period from relatively low levels as period rates remained elevated, incentivizing owners to place new orders.

The difference in the NAV price and the benchmark
value often results in the appearance of a NAV premium or discount to the benchmark. Differences in the benchmark return and the BDRY
net asset value per share are due primarily to the following factors: 

Benchmark portfolio uses settlement prices of freight futures vs. BDRY closing Share price, 

Benchmark portfolio roll methodology assumes rolls that can happen even at fractions of lots vs. BDRY that uses the real minimum market lot available (5 lots minimum), 

Benchmark portfolio assumes rolls are happening at the settlement price of the day vs. that buys at a transaction price during the day that might or might not be equal to the settlement price, 

Benchmark portfolio assumes no trading commissions vs. BDRY that pays 10bps for each transaction, 

Benchmark portfolio assumes no clearing fees vs. BDRY that pays approximately 12 per lot in clearing fees for each trade, 

Benchmark portfolio assumes no management fees vs. BDRY fee structure of 3.5 of average net assets on an annualized basis, and 

Creations and redemptions that lead to transactions that occur at prices that might be different than the settlement prices 

There are no competitors. BDRY is the only Freight
futures ETF globally.

the net asset value of each Share decreased (0.54 from 5.53 per Share to 5.50 per Share. Gains in the investments and futures contracts
were more than offset by the net investment loss and the impact of the timing of Share sales and redemptions resulted in the overall decrease
in the NAV per Share during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Breakwave Tanker Shipping ETF 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, crude tanker spot
rates experienced low volatility, with average spot rates for Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) remaining about flat from the previous
year. 

Geopolitical turmoil has greatly affected global shipping, as the Israel-Hamas
conflict and the resulting ship attacks in the Red Sea passage have rearranged shipping routes in the process lengthening the average
trip and leading to significant disruptions across all shipping segments. For crude tanker shipping the impact has been relatively small,
as most of the crude shipped in Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) does not use the Suez Canal. Although the disruption initially had a
knock-on effect on crude tanker rates, fundamentally this sub sector of the broader tanker market has not been affected by the conflict. 

China remains the main region of demand growth for crude oil and, as
a result, for crude tanker demand. However, slower oil import growth and weaker domestic demand in China remains a major concern for tanker
rates. The Chinese economy has experienced a deceleration in economic growth, and although import activity has been relatively stable,
during the first nine months of 2024 oil imports declined marginally. With OPEC+ maintaining its existing production quota throughout
the period, there has been little room for tanker demand growth, and although longer sailing distances associated with Brazilian and US
oil exports have aided overall tanker demand, such an increase has not been sufficient to push spot tanker rates higher. The recent announcement
by OPEC+ to gradually increase oil production starting in December of 2024, should, if implemented, increase demand for crude tankers. 

The crude tanker orderbook for the next few years remains historically
low, with very few new vessel deliveries during the period aiding the overall projected market balance. However, the orderbook has been
steadily increasing during the period from the record low levels of summer 2023.

resulting from net realized gains on investments and futures contracts of 33,625, net unrealized losses on investments and futures contracts

Calculating NAV 

Each Fund s NAV is calculated by: 

Taking the current market value of its total assets; 

Subtracting any liabilities; and 

Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares. 

The Administrator calculates the NAV of the Funds
once each NYSE Arca trading day. The NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. E.T. Regular trading on the NYSE Arca
typically closes at 4:00 p.m. E.T. The Administrator uses the Baltic Exchange settlement price for the Freight Futures and option contracts.
The Administrator calculates or determines the value of all other BDRY and BWET investments using market quotations, if available, or
other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the close of the NYSE Arca (normally 4:00 p.m.
E.T.), in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, the Fund and the Sponsor. 

40 

In addition, in order to provide updated information
relating to the Funds for use by investors and market professionals, an updated indicative fund value IFV is made available
through on-line information services throughout the core trading hours of 9:30 a.m. E.T. to 4:00 p.m. E.T. on each trading day. The IFV
is calculated by using the prior day s closing NAV per share of each Fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading
day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and/or options held by each Fund. Certain Freight Futures
brokers provide real time pricing information to the general public either through their websites or through data vendors such as Bloomberg
or Reuters. The IFV disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV, because
the NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of each of the Funds investments. 

The IFV is disseminated on a per share basis every
15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours. The customary trading hours of the Freight Futures trading are 3:00 a.m.
E.T. to 12:00 p.m. E.T. This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and/or the end of each day during which the Funds 
shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time trading prices for contracts are not available. During such gaps in time the IFV will
be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the Baltic Exchange s immediately preceding trading session.
In addition, other investments held by the Funds will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved
third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor or broker-dealer quotes. These investments will not be included in the
IFV. 

The NYSE Arca disseminates the IFV through the
facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the IFV is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line
information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters. 

Dissemination of the IFV provides additional information
that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the
Funds shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price
of the Funds shares and the IFV. If the market price of the Funds shares diverges significantly from the IFV, market professionals
will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if the Funds shares appear to be trading at a discount compared
to the IFV, a market professional could purchase the Funds shares on the NYSE Arca and take the opposite position in Freight Futures.
Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the Funds shares and the IFV and thus can be beneficial
to all market participants. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Preparation of the combined financial statements
and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate accounting
rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Each Fund s application of these policies involves judgments and the use of
estimates. Actual results may differ from the estimates used and such differences could be material. The Funds hold a significant portion
of their assets in futures contracts and money market funds, which are held at fair value. 

There were no material estimates, which involve
a significant level of estimation uncertainty and had or are reasonably likely to have had a material impact on the Funds financial
condition, used in the preparation of these combined financial statements. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Funds do not anticipate making use of borrowings
or other lines of credit to meet their obligations. The Funds meets their liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds
of the sale of their investments or from the cash, and/or cash equivalents that they hold. The Funds liquidity needs include: redeeming
their shares, providing margin deposits for existing Benchmark Component Instruments, the purchase of additional Benchmark Component Instruments,
and paying expenses. 

The Funds generate cash primarily from (i) the
sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and its investments in collateralizing Treasury Securities,
if any. Generally, all of the net assets of the Funds are allocated to trading in Benchmark Component Instruments. Most of the assets
of the Funds are held in cash and/or cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral for trading in Benchmark Component
Instruments. The percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the
Benchmark Component Instruments change. Interest earned on interest-bearing assets of the Funds are paid to the Funds. BDRY earned 274,416
and 537,710, respectively, in interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. BWET earned 26,431 and 6,406,
respectively, in interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The investments of the Funds in Benchmark Component
Instruments could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. Such
conditions could prevent the Funds from promptly liquidating a position in Benchmark Component Instruments. Commodity exchanges may limit
fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits. During a
single day, no futures trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or
decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in such futures contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders
are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive
days with little or no trading. Such market conditions could prevent the Funds from promptly liquidating their futures positions. 

Because the Funds trade futures contracts, their
capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) or the inability of counter-parties to perform under the
terms of the contracts (credit risk). 

41 

Market Risk 

Trading in Benchmark Component Instruments such
as futures contracts will involve the Funds entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of instruments
at a specified date in the future. The gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements
of the Funds as the Funds intend to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date. As a result, the Funds 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts. The Funds consider the fair value of
derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with the settlement of contracts
will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contracts held. 

The exposure of the Funds to market risk will
depend on a number of factors including the markets for the specific instrument, the volatility of freight rates, the liquidity of the
instrument-specific market and the relationships among the contracts held by the Funds. 

Credit Risk 

When the Funds enter into Benchmark Component
Instruments, they will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. For purposes of credit
risk, the counterparty for the Benchmark Component Instruments traded on or cleared by the Baltic Exchange and other futures exchanges
is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges. In general, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share
in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members, which should significantly reduce credit risk. There
can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to the Funds. 

The Sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of
these market and credit risks by normally: 

executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor; 

limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the Funds; 

not posting margin directly with a counterparty; 

limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the FCM; and 

ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for. 

The Commodity Exchange Act CEA requires all FCMs, such as the Funds clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate
customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books
and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit
or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the
CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of
market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from
alleged violations of the CEA. The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC. 

On November 14, 2013, the CFTC published
final regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital
and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford
greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided
with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are
monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued
operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities
of FCMs in a thorough manner. 

42 

Regulatory Environment 

The regulation of futures markets, futures contracts,
and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive. The CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in
the event of a market emergency including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits, increased margin
requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. 

The regulation of commodity interest transactions
in the United States is an evolving area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable
regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. There is
a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment
in the Funds, or the ability of the Funds to continue to implement their investment strategies. In addition, various national governments
outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodities markets
and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Funds are impossible to
predict but could be substantial and adverse. 

The CFTC possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate
the activities of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors with respect commodity interests, such as futures,
swaps and options, and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons and/or entities. Under the CEA, a registered
CPO, such as the Sponsor, is required to make annual filings with the CFTC and NFA describing its organization, capital structure, management
and controlling persons. In addition, the CEA authorizes the CFTC to require and review books and records of, and documents prepared by,
registered CPOs. Pursuant to this authority, the CFTC requires CPOs to keep accurate, current and orderly records for each pool that they
operate. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator (1) if the CFTC finds that the operator s trading practices
tend to disrupt orderly market conditions, (2) if any controlling person of the operator is subject to an order of the CFTC denying such
person trading privileges on any exchange, and (3) in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Sponsor s
registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until that registration were to be reinstated, from managing the Funds, and
might result in the termination of the Funds if a successor sponsor is not elected pursuant to the Trust Agreement. 

The Funds investors are afforded prescribed
rights for reparations under the CEA. Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA. The
CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations
award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and
their respective associated persons. 

Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has
been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. At the present time, the NFA is the only self-regulatory
organization for commodity interest professionals, other than futures exchanges. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for
the registration of CPOs and FCMs and their respective associated persons. The Sponsor is a member of the NFA and, as such, it will be
subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition and consumer protection. The NFA also arbitrates disputes
between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness screening of applicants for membership and audits of its existing
members. Neither the Trust nor the Funds are required to become a member of the NFA. 

The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA
prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or
membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA has approved or endorsed that person or that person s
trading program or objectives. The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as
constituting any such approval or endorsement. Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or
endorsement. 

Futures exchanges in the United States are subject
to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade
or electronic trading facility. Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as
administered by the CFTC. The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive
speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets. In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations
themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in response to the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 and it significantly
altered the regulatory regime to which the securities and commodities markets are subject. To date, the CFTC has issued proposed or final
versions of almost all of the rules it is required to promulgate under the Dodd-Frank Act. The provisions of the law include the requirement
that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests, including agricultural, energy, and metal-based commodity
futures contracts, options on such futures contracts and cleared and uncleared swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures
contracts and options; new registration and recordkeeping requirements for swap market participants; capital and margin requirements for
 swap dealers and major swap participants, as determined by the law and applicable regulations; reporting of
all swaps transactions to swap data repositories; and the mandatory use of clearinghouse mechanisms for sufficiently standardized swap
transactions that were historically entered into in the over-the-counter market, but are now designated as subject to the clearing requirement;
and margin requirements for over-the counter swaps that are not subject to the clearing requirements. 

The Dodd-Frank Act was intended to reduce systemic
risks that may have contributed to the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Since the first draft of what became the Dodd-Frank Act, supporters
and opponents have debated the scope of the legislation. As the administrations of the U.S. change, the interpretation and implementation
will change with them. Nevertheless, regulatory reform of any kind may have a significant impact on U.S. regulated entities. 

Current rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank
Act require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards,
customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants
that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures
trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital
and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and
the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner. 

Regulatory bodies outside the U.S. have also passed
or proposed, or may propose in the future, legislation similar to that proposed by the Dodd-Frank Act or other legislation containing
other restrictions that could adversely impact the liquidity of and increase costs of participating in the commodities markets. For example,
the European Union Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2014/65/EU) and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014) (together MiFID II ), which has applied since January 3, 2018, governs the provision of investment services
and activities in relation to, as well as the organized trading of, financial instruments such as shares, bonds, units in collective investment
schemes and derivatives. In particular, MiFID II requires EU Member States to apply position limits to the size of a net position which
a person can hold at any time in commodity derivatives traded on EU trading venues and in economically equivalent over-the-counter OTC contracts. By way of further example, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 648/2012,
as amended) EMIR introduced certain requirements in respect of OTC derivatives including: (i) the mandatory clearing of
OTC derivative contracts declared subject to the clearing obligation; (ii) risk mitigation techniques in respect of un-cleared OTC derivative
contracts, including the mandatory margining of un-cleared OTC derivative contracts; and (iii) reporting and recordkeeping requirements
in respect of all derivatives contracts. In the event that the requirements under EMIR and MiFID II apply, these are expected to increase
the cost of transacting derivatives. 

In addition, considerable regulatory attention
has been focused on non-traditional publicly distributed investment pools such as the Funds. Furthermore, various national governments
have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in certain commodity markets and the need to regulate the
derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Funds is impossible to predict, but could be substantial
and adverse.

Off Balance Sheet Financing 

As of September 30, 2024, neither the Trust nor
the Funds have any loan guarantees, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into
in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks service providers undertake in
performing services which are in the best interests of the Funds. While the exposure of the Funds under these indemnification provisions
cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Funds. 

Redemption Basket Obligation 

Other than as necessary to meet the investment
objective of the Funds and pay the contractual obligations described below, the Funds will require liquidity to redeem Redemption Baskets.
The Funds intend to satisfy this obligation through the transfer of cash of the Funds (generated, if necessary, through the sale of money
market funds invested in Treasury obligations) in an amount proportionate to the number of Shares being redeemed. 

Contractual Obligations 

The primary contractual obligations of the Funds
will be with the Sponsor and certain other service providers. 

Management and CTA Fees 

BDRY and BWET each pay the Sponsor a management
fee (the Sponsor Fee in consideration of the Sponsor s advisory services to the Funds. Additionally, BDRY and BWET
each pay Breakwave a license and service fee (the CTA Fee ). 

BDRY pays the Sponsor Fee, monthly in arrears,
in an amount equal to the greater of 0.15 per year of BDRY s average daily net assets; or 125,000. BDRY s Sponsor Fee is
paid in consideration of the Sponsor s management services to BDRY. BDRY also pays Breakwave the CTA Fee monthly in arrears, for
the use of BDRY s Benchmark Portfolio in an amount equal to 1.45 per annum of BDRY s average daily net assets. 

Breakwave has agreed to waive its CTA Fee and
the Sponsor has agreed to correspondingly assume the remaining expenses of BDRY so that BDRY s expenses do not exceed an annual
rate of 3.50 , excluding brokerage commissions, interest expense, and extraordinary expenses, of the value of BDRY s average daily
net assets (the BDRY Expense Cap ). The assumption of expenses and waiver of BDRY s CTA Fee are contractual on the
part of the Sponsor and Breakwave, respectively, through December 31, 2024. If after that date, the Sponsor and/or Breakwave no longer
assumed expenses or waived the CTA Fee, respectively, BDRY could be adversely impacted, including in its ability to achieve its investment
objective. 

The assumption of expenses by the Sponsor
for BDRY, pursuant to the BDRY Expense Cap, amounted to -0- and -0- for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, as disclosed in the Combined Statements of Operations. The waiver of Breakwave s CTA fees, pursuant to the
undertaking, amounted to 92,369 and -0- for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as disclosed in the
Combined Statements of Operations. BDRY currently accrues its daily expenses based upon established individual expense amounts or
the BDRY Expense Cap, whichever aggregate amount is less. At the end of each month, the accrued amount is remitted to the Sponsor as
the Sponsor is responsible for the payment of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund.
BDRY s total expenses, prior to the assumption and waiver of expenses, amounted to 424,449 and 701,671 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, as disclosed in the Combined Statements of Operations. 

BWET pays the Sponsor Fee, monthly in arrears,
in an amount equal to the greater of 0.30 per year of BWET s average daily net assets, or 50,000. BWET s Sponsor Fee is
paid in consideration of the Sponsor s management services to BWET. BWET also pays Breakwave the CTA Fee monthly in arrears, for
the use of BWET s Benchmark Portfolio in an amount equal to 1.45 per annum of BWET s average daily net assets. 

Breakwave has agreed to waive its CTA Fee and
the Sponsor has agreed to correspondingly assume the remaining expenses of BWET so that BWET s expenses do not exceed an annual
rate of 3.50 , excluding brokerage commissions, interest expense, and extraordinary expenses, of the value of BWET s average daily
net assets (the BWET Expense Cap ). The assumption of expenses and waiver of BWET s CTA Fee are contractual on the
part of the Sponsor and Breakwave, respectively, through December 31, 2024. If after that date, the Sponsor and/or Breakwave no longer
assumed expenses or waived the CTA Fee, respectively, BWET could be adversely impacted, including in its ability to achieve its investment
objective. 

The assumption of expenses by the Sponsor for
BWET, pursuant to the BWET Expense Cap, amounted to 73,835 and 86,109 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
as disclosed in the Combined Statements of Operations. The waiver of Breakwave s CTA fees, pursuant to the undertaking, amounted
to 10,193 and 12,783 for the three ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as disclosed in the Combined Statements of Operations.
BWET currently accrues its daily expenses based upon established individual expense category amounts or the BWET Expense Cap, whichever
aggregate amount is less. At the end of each month, the accrued amount is remitted to the Sponsor as the Sponsor is responsible for the
payment of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund. BWET s total expenses, prior to the
assumption and waiver of expenses, amounted to 119,002 and 145,141 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
as disclosed in the Combined Statements of Operations. 

45 

Each Fund s ongoing fees, costs and expenses
of its operation, not subject to the applicable Expense Cap include brokerage and other fees and commissions incurred in connection with
the trading activities of the Fund, and extraordinary expenses (including, but not limited to, legal claims and liabilities and litigation
costs and any indemnification related thereto). Expenses subject to an Expense Cap include (i) expenses incurred in connection with registering
additional Shares of a Fund or offering Shares of a Fund; (ii) the routine expenses associated with the preparation and, if required,
the printing and mailing of monthly, quarterly, annual and other reports required by applicable U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities,
Trust meetings and preparing, printing and mailing proxy statements to Shareholders; (iii) the routine services of the Trustee, legal
counsel and independent accountants; (iv) routine accounting, bookkeeping, custodial and transfer agency services, whether performed by
an outside service provider or by affiliates of the Sponsor; (v) postage and insurance; (vi) costs and expenses associated with client
relations and services; (vii) costs of preparation of all federal, state, local and foreign tax returns and any taxes payable on the income,
assets or operations of a Fund. 

While the Sponsor has agreed to pay registration
fees to the SEC and any other regulatory agency in connection with the initial offering and sale of the Shares offered through each Fund s
prospectus, and the legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated with such registration, each Funds will be responsible for
any registration fees and related expenses incurred in connection with any future offer and sale of Shares of the Fund in excess of those
offered through its initial prospectus. 

Any general expenses of the Trust will be allocated
among the Funds and any other future series of the Trust as determined by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion. The Trust is
also responsible for extraordinary expenses, including, but not limited to, legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any
indemnification related thereto. The Trust and/or the Sponsor may be required to indemnify the Trustee, Distributor or Administrator under
certain circumstances. 

The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments
that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as the NAV and trading levels to meet investment objectives for the
Funds will not be known until a future date. These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option
to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of a Fund s existence. The parties may terminate these agreements earlier
for certain reasons listed in the agreements.
