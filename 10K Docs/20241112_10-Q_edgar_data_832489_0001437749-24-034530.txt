Overview 

GeoVax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases using novel vector vaccine platforms. GeoVax s product pipeline includes ongoing human clinical trials for a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine and a gene-directed therapy against advanced head and neck cancer. Additional preclinical research and development programs include preventive vaccines against Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan, and Marburg), and Zika virus, as well as immunotherapies for solid tumors. 

Our corporate strategy is to advance, protect and exploit our differentiated vaccine/immunotherapy technologies leading to the successful development of preventive and therapeutic vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious diseases and various cancers. Our goal is to advance products through to human clinical testing, and to seek partnership or licensing arrangements for achieving regulatory approval and commercialization. We also leverage third party resources through collaborations and partnerships for preclinical and clinical testing with multiple government, academic and corporate entities. 

Our programs are in various stages of development, the most significant of which are summarized below along with recent developments: 

GEO-CM04S1 Next Generation COVID-19 Vaccine: 

o 

On June 12, 2024, GeoVax was awarded a contract (the BARDA Contract through the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) to advance the clinical development of GEO-CM04S1. The RRPV is a Consortium funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Under the agreement, GeoVax will sponsor a 10,000-participant, randomized, Phase 2b double-blinded study to assess the clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of GEO-CM04S1 compared with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The direct award to GeoVax, currently approximately 26.2 million and which may increase to as much as 45 million, is funding the manufacturing of clinical materials and support for the Phase 2b clinical trial, including regulatory activities. BARDA has made a separate award of approximately 343 million through its Clinical Studies Network to Allucent, a global clinical research organization, to execute the clinical trial as part of BARDA s Clinical Studies Network. Target clinical sites are confirmed and manufacturing activities are underway for production of the vaccine product needed for study activation. 

10

o 

GEO-CM04S1 is currently undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04977024), evaluating its safety and efficacy as a preventive COVID-19 vaccine in high-risk immunocompromised patients (i.e. patients with blood cancers who have previously received either an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy). Data published from the safety lead-in portion of the trial indicates that GEO-CM04S1 is highly immunogenic in these patients, inducing broad and durable neutralizing antibody and T cell responses. 

o 

GEO-CM04S1 is also undergoing the Phase 2 portion of a Phase 1/2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04639466), evaluating two vaccine dose levels as a heterologous COVID-19 booster vaccine to current FDA-approved mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. In February 2024, we announced positive interim safety and immune responses findings following vaccine administration. Consolidated data (blinded to vaccine dose) from all subjects tested one-month post-vaccination, documented statistically significant increases in neutralizing antibody responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, ranging from the original Wuhan strain through Delta and Omicron XBB 1.5. 

o 

An investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05672355) of GEO-CM04S1 is evaluating its use as a COVID-19 vaccine booster in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) compared to the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine. 

Gedeptin : 

o 

Gedeptin recently completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (PNP-002) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03754933) for treatment of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This trial is being funded in part by the U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) pursuant to its Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grants Program. 

o 

In July 2024, we announced that a special clinical advisory board completed a comprehensive review of the PNP-002 trial results, together with the previously completed Phase 1 trial (PNP-001). This review concluded that Gedeptin demonstrated an acceptable safety and efficacy profile to support continued development. In addition, the therapy has demonstrated sufficient tumor stabilization/reduction activity to support plans to advance clinical development of Gedeptin therapy in an expanded Phase 2 clinical trial. 

o 

We have initiated activities in support of a Phase 2 trial in first-recurrence head and neck cancer. The primary goal of this trial will be to establish efficacy of neoadjuvant Gedeptin therapy combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in squamous cell head and neck cancer. This trial is anticipated to be a single cycle trial with surgery to follow in approximately 36 patients with pathologic response rate as the primary endpoint. We have initiated the necessary planning activities, including protocol development, manufacturing and CRO selection, with the trial activation anticipated during the first half of 2025. 

GEO-MVA: 

o 

GEO-MVA is the Company vaccine candidate in development for protection against Mpox and Smallpox. MVA is the vaccine recommended by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) against both Mpox and Smallpox, recognized for its safety and efficacy among all patient populations, including pregnant women, children and immunocompromised individuals. MVA is the vaccine currently used and stockpiled in the United States Strategic National Stockpile for immunization against potential bioterrorism threats based on the smallpox virus. 

o 

We have produced and released the cGMP Master Seed Virus for GEO-MVA and are currently producing the cGMP Working Virus Seed (WVS) bank. We expect to complete cGMP production of a clinical batch of GEO-MVA before year-end 2024, which will then be reviewed with stakeholders for potential clinical use. 

Our additional research programs for vaccines and immunotherapies at various stages of preclinical development. 

General Corporate: 

o 

On May 23, 2024, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq notifying the Company that it no longer complied with the 2,500,000 minimum stockholders equity required for continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Stockholders Equity Requirement ), because the Company s stockholders equity as reported in its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 did not meet the required minimum. On July 18, 2024, we received notice from Nasdaq granting our request for an extension of time to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement until November 19, 2024. As a result of several financing transactions completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we believe that, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company has regained compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement. Nasdaq will continue to monitor our ongoing compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement and, if at the time of our next periodic report, we do not evidence compliance, the Company may be subject to delisting.

Financial Overview 

Revenue 

Our revenues to date have been related to government grants and contracts and other collaborative arrangements in support of our product development activities. We have not generated any revenue to date from the sale of the products we are developing. Our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing. All product candidates that we advance to clinical testing will require regulatory approval prior to commercial use and will require significant costs for commercialization. 

Research and development expenses 

Since our inception, we have focused and we continue to focus significant resources on our research and development activities, including developing our vector platform and analytical testing methods, conducting preclinical studies, developing manufacturing processes, and conducting clinical trials. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of the following: 

personnel costs in our research and development functions, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; 

expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations CROs ), for the conduct of clinical trials; 

expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ), that manufacture product used in clinical trials; 

expenses incurred in procuring materials and for analytical and release testing services required to produce vaccine candidates used in clinical trials; 

process development expenses to improve the efficiency and yield of the bulk vaccine; 

laboratory supplies, vendor expenses and other third-party contract expenses related to preclinical research activities; 

technology license fees; 

consultant expenses for services supporting our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing activities; and 

facilities, depreciation and other general overhead expenses. 

We expect our research and development expenditures to increase as we advance our existing and future product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval, especially with regard to the Gedeptin and GEO-CM04S1 clinical programs. We do not provide forward-looking estimates of costs and time to complete our research programs due to the many uncertainties associated with biotechnology research and development. Due to these uncertainties, our future expenditures are likely to be highly volatile in future periods depending on the outcomes of the trials and studies. As we obtain data from preclinical studies and clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay certain development programs to focus our resources on more promising product candidates. Completion of preclinical studies and human clinical trials may take several years or more, but the length of time can vary substantially depending upon several factors. The duration and the cost of future clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of the project because of differences arising during development of the human clinical trial protocols, including the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects, the number of patients that ultimately participate in the clinical trial, the duration of patient follow-up, and the number of clinical sites included in the clinical trials. 

General and administrative expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs in our executive, finance and investor relations, business development and administrative functions, including stock-based compensation. Other general and administrative expenses include consulting fees, professional service fees for accounting and legal services, lease expenses related to our offices, insurance premiums, intellectual property costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications, depreciation and other costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as we support expanded research and development activities, prepare for potential commercialization of our current and future product candidates, maintain compliance with requirements of Nasdaq and the SEC, and other general corporate activities. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and adjusts the estimates as necessary. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

12

For a description of critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates during the preparation of our financial statements, refer to the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are likely or reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, other than the operating lease for our office and laboratory space.

Revenue from Government Contract 

During the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024, we reported 2,789,484 and 3,090,161, respectively, of revenues associated with the BARDA Contract. There were no revenues reported during the comparable 2023 periods. 

Research and Development Expenses 

For the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased by 454,905 (6.5 and 1,618,584 (11.2 ), respectively, versus the comparable 2023 periods. The overall increase during the nine-month period of 2024 versus 2023 relates primarily to costs of manufacturing materials for use in our clinical trials of GEO-CM04S1 and other costs associated with the BARDA Contract. Research and development expenses for the three-month and nine-month periods of 2024 include stock-based compensation expense of 59,384 and 163,654, respectively; as compared to 77,873 and 232,516, respectively, for the comparable 2023 periods. 

13

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased by 410,599 (24.9 and 777,734 (17 ), respectively, versus the comparable 2023 periods. The overall decrease during the 2024 periods relates primarily to lower stock-based compensation expense, consulting costs, legal and patent costs and franchise tax cost. General and administrative expenses for the three-month and nine-month periods of 2024 includes stock-based compensation expense of 70,538 and 225,645, respectively; as compared to 220,075 and 580,983, respectively, for the comparable periods of 2023. 

Other Income 

Interest income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was 53,191 and 91,611, respectively, as compared to 190,936 and 674,835, respectively, for comparable periods of 2023. The overall decrease during the 2024 periods is primarily attributable to cash available for investment. Interest expense for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was 14,083 and 21,375, respectively, associated with certain notes payable issued during May 2024 and repaid in August 2024.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the 2024 period primarily relates to offerings of our common stock and warrants and exercise of previously issued warrants. 

Funding Requirements and Sources of Capital 

To date, we have not generated any product revenue. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any product revenue and we do not expect to generate significant product revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize one of our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all of the risks incident to the development of new products, and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may harm our business. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We have funded our operations to date primarily from sales of our equity securities and from government grants and clinical trial assistance. 

14

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we closed four registered direct offerings of our common stock and warrants, as well as established the ATM Program (see footnote 6 to the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report). Net proceeds to us from these offerings, after deducting commissions to the placement agent and sales agent, as applicable, and other related offering expenses, were approximately 16.7 million. We also received approximately 2.4 million upon the exercise of warrants. 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2025. We plan to pursue additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings, government grants/contracts, arrangements with strategic partners, or from other sources. 

There can be no assurance that necessary funding will be available on favorable terms or at all. These factors collectively raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that we will be successful in securing the additional capital required to continue the Company s planned operations, but that our plans do not fully alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to operate as a going concern. 

We will need to continue to raise additional capital to support our future operating activities, including progression of our development programs, preparation for commercialization, and other operating costs. We may fund a significant portion of our ongoing operations through partnering and collaboration agreements which, while reducing our risks and extending our cash runway, will also reduce our share of eventual revenues, if any, from our vaccine candidates. We may be able to fund certain activities with assistance from government programs. 

The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may also fund our operations through debt financing, which would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market vaccine candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Any of these actions could harm our business, results of operations and prospects. 

Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties and is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong; actual results could vary materially. Our projection takes into consideration contractual commitments we have made, and expect to make, in the normal course of operating our business, which include (i) obligations to our employees, (ii) our lease obligations, (iii) payments due under license agreements for various technologies and patent rights associated with our product development activities, (iv) arrangements with contract research organizations CROs ), contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ), and other third-party vendors for clinical trials services and production of materials for use in our clinical trials, and (v) other various firm purchase commitments and contractual obligations related to production and testing of our product candidates and the general operation of our business. 

We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, which include but are not limited to: 

the timing and costs of our ongoing and planned clinical trials; 

the timing and costs of manufacturing material for use in clinical trials; 

the number and scope of our research programs and the speed at which they are advanced; 

the progress and success of our preclinical and clinical development activities; 

the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

the costs to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

the costs to maintain and expand our infrastructure to support our operations, our product development, and planned future commercialization efforts; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; 

the costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire; and 

the costs and timing of regulatory approvals.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4 

Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Controls 

Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
