 NOTES TO
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company s significant estimates include income taxes provision
and valuation allowance of deferred tax assets; the fair value of financial instruments; the carrying value and recoverability of long-lived
assets, including the values assigned to an estimated useful lives of computer equipment; and the assumption that the Company will continue
as a going concern. Those significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties
attached to those estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value. Management bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. 

Management regularly reviews its estimates utilizing currently available
information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate,
those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related
party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business.
However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required
in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved description of the transactions, including
transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented,
and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the
dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the
method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each
balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement. 

The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Section 740-10-25 with regards to uncertainty income taxes. Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination
of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section
740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
(50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.

On September 9, 2021, the Company effected a of its common stock. All share and earnings per share information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock
split was recorded with the offset to additional paid-in capital. 

On July 12, 2021, the Company completed the cancellation of 
shares of common stock pursuant to an Assignment of Rights agreement dated October 3, 2016 where certain shareholders have entered into
with the Company to return shares of common stock to the Company as treasury stock. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has

The Company is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has shares issued and outstanding. 

of net operating
losses NOL carried forward to offset future taxable income. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the
deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized. 

Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of
1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change
in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The following management s discussion and analysis MD A should be read in conjunction with financial statements of Asiarim Corp. aka Un Monde International Ltd. for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the notes thereto. 

Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements included in this MD A constitute forward-looking
statements, including those identified by the expressions anticipate, believe, plan, estimate, expect, intend, and similar
expressions to the extent they relate to Asiarim Corp. aka Un Monde International Ltd. or its management. These forward-looking statements
are not facts, promises, or guarantees; rather, they reflect current expectations regarding future results or events. These forward-looking
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, activities, performance, or events to differ materially
from current expectations. These include risks related to revenue growth, operating results, industry, products, and litigation, as well
as the matters discussed in Asiarim Corp. aka Un Monde International Ltd. s MD A. Readers should not place undue reliance on
any such forward-looking statements. Asiarim Corp. aka Un Monde International Ltd. disclaims any obligation to publicly update or to revise
any such statements to reflect any change in the Company s expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any
such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements. 

Overview 

Asiarim Corp. aka Un Monde International Ltd. is a developmental stage
company that focus on offering education and management services to private, distinguished, specialized, and internationalized education
to international students in schools. We are implementing our business within the next 12 months. 

The Company has entered into a Commercial Lease Agreement for which
the Company will use the leased property as its private education operation headquarter office space. 

Accordingly, pursuant to the status above, the Company is a development
stage company that has engaged in activities that are, at a minimum, sufficient to manifest a strong commitment in pursuing a legitimate
business as set forth in the Company s business plan. Based on the business conducted by the Company since May 2023, the Company
believes it ceased being a shell as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has remained a non-shell company
since then based on the most recent quarterly filings. 

Going Concern 

As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company
has net losses, accumulated deficit and a negative working capital without generating any revenues. These factors among others raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

While the Company has not commenced operations and generate revenues,
the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to
raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement
its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that
effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its
business plan and generate revenues. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

14 

Results of Operations 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in this report. 

Three and Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
had not generated any revenues. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
had not generated any revenues. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were
 22,882 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 25,834. The operating expenses for these two periods remained similar
and reasonable, with no significant changes to the Company s operations. 

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were
 66,243 compared to 51,777 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The operating expenses for these two periods remained similar
and reasonable, with no significant changes to the Company s operations. 

Other Income and Expenses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
did not have any other income or expenses. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
did not have any other income or expenses. 

Net Income (Loss) 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net
loss of 22,882 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 of a net loss of 25,384. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net
loss of 66,243 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of a net loss of 51,777 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had no cash and had
a working capital deficit of 270,466. 

The Company has not generated any revenues from operations, and may
be unable to fund on-going activities. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in generating
revenues and cash flows, and the possibility of new regulations that will make our company difficult or impossible to operate. 

If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our operations,
or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations. 

If we are unable to complete any phase of our development program or
fail to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future, we may be unable to carry out our full business plan or we
may be forced to cease operations. 

The Company s related party will continue to advance the necessary
capital to pay the expenses of the Company and there are no formal financing agreements in place. The outstanding amount due to related
parties was 239,111 and 179,860 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

15 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities were 59,251 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 83,213 for the same period ended 2023. The change resulted from net loss of 66,243 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 with accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by 4,416 from 2,441 at December 31, 2023 to 6,857 at
September 30, 2024, as well as an increase in security deposit of 1,486 for lease of office space, and decrease in lease liability of
 16,744. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is related to other professional fee and administration expenses incurred
and payable during the period. 

Investing Activities 

No investing activities occurred during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities were 59,251 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 83,213 for the same period ended in 2023. The Company received advances of 59,251 and 83,213 from
related party for working capital purposes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements with
any party. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial
condition are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to provisions for uncollectible
accounts receivable, inventories, valuation of intangible assets and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The accounting policies that we follow are set
forth in Note 2 to our financial statements as included in the SEC report filed. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements. 

16 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, 
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information in this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including
the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO (the Company s principal
financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. The framework used by management in making that
assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO
and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure for the reason described below. 

Because of our limited operations, we have limited number of employees
which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a formal audit committee with a financial expert. As we grow and expand
our operations, we will engage additional employees and experts as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will
expand. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
