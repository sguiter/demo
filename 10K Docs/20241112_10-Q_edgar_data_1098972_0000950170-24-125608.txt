 million, a decrease of million from December 31, 2023 . Cash and cash equivalents of our subsidiary, MiNK, at June 30, 2024, were million. MiNK cash can only be accessed by Agenus through a declaration of a dividend by the MiNK Board of Directors or through settlement of intercompany balances. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of billion and million of subordinated notes maturing in . Since our founding we have financed our operations principally through income and revenues generated from corporate partnerships, advance royalty sales and proceeds from equity issuances. Based on our current plans and projections, we believe that our cash resources of million at September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to satisfy our critical liquidity requirements through the end of the year and into 2025. To support operations further, meet our subordinated notes obligation, and to execute on our business plans, we require additional funding. Currently we are in discussions with several entities including biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners, as well as dedicated healthcare funds to provide the funding necessary to support our operations through our planned biologics license application, or marketing authorization, submission for botensilimab/balstilimab. However, because the completion of such transactions is not entirely within our control, in accordance with accounting guidance we are required to disclose that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes Agenus will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Management continues to address the Company s liquidity needs and has continued to adjust spending in order to preserve liquidity. In August 2023, we prioritized and focused our resources to accelerate the development, registration, and commercialization of our lead asset postponing all preclinical and other clinical programs and reducing our workforce by approximately . Our CEO, Dr. Garo Armen has elected to receive his base salary and any potential bonus payments in stock rather than cash. We continuously evaluate the likelihood of success of our programs. As such, our decisions to continue to fund or eliminate funding of each of our programs are predicated on these determinations, on an ongoing basis. We expect our sources of funding to include payments from

All common share, per share and related information included in the accompanying financial statements and footnote disclosures have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. See Note L for further details. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we deconsolidated certain foreign subsidiaries and recognized gains of approximately and , respectively, included in "Other income (expense)" on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Healthcare Royalty Partners In January 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Antigenics, LLC Antigenics ), entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the HCR Royalty Purchase Agreement with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, HCR ). Pursuant to the terms of the HCR Royalty Purchase Agreement, we sold to HCR of Antigenics worldwide rights to receive royalties from GlaxoSmithKline GSK on sales of GSK s vaccines containing our STIMULON QS-21 adjuvant. At closing, we received gross proceeds of million from HCR. Although we sold all of our rights to receive royalties on sales of GSK s vaccines containing QS-21, as a result of our obligation to HCR, we are required to account for the million in proceeds from this transaction as a liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet that will be recognized into revenue in proportion to the royalty payments from GSK to HCR over the estimated life of the HCR Royalty Purchase Agreement. The liability is classified between the current and non-current portion of liability related to sale of future royalties and milestones in the condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the estimated royalty payments to be received by HCR in the next 12 months from the financial statement reporting date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized million of non-cash royalty revenue, and we recorded million of related non-cash interest expense related to the HCR Royalty Purchase Agreement. 

 10 

million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the HCR Royalty Purchase Agreement. Periodically, we assess the estimated royalty payments to be paid to HCR from GSK, and to the extent the amount or timing of the payments is materially different from our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the liability, and the related recognition of interest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement decreased to , which results in a life of contract interest rate of . Ligand Pharmaceuticals In May 2024, we and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Ligand Purchase Agreement") with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ("Ligand"). Pursuant to the terms of the Ligand Purchase Agreement, Ligand will receive (i) of the development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments we were then eligible to receive under our agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS"), UroGen Pharma Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc. ("Gilead"), Merck Sharpe Dohme and Incyte Corporation ("Incyte"), (the Covered License Agreements (ii) of the royalties the Company receives under the Covered License Agreements; and (iii) a synthetic royalty on worldwide net sales of botensilimab and balstilimab (collectively the Purchased Assets ). The total amounts payable to Ligand are subject to a reduction in the event total payments to Ligand exceed a specified return hurdle. The synthetic royalty is subject to a reduction if annual worldwide net sales exceed a specified level, and a cap on annual worldwide net sales if annual worldwide net sales exceed a higher specified level. The synthetic royalty can increase by based on the occurrence of certain future events. In consideration for the sale of the Purchased Assets, we received gross proceeds of million, less million in reimbursable expenses, on the closing date. In addition, Ligand has a time-based option to invest an additional million on a pro rata basis ("Purchaser Upsize Option"). In connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets, we issued to Ligand a warrant (the "Ligand Warrant") to purchase shares of our common stock, at an exercise price equal to per share. See Note L - Equity for further detail. The million in gross proceeds was allocated to the identified components as follows: 

Ligand Warrant 

Purchaser Upsize Option 

Total Ligand Purchase Agreement gross proceeds 

As a result of our significant continuing involvement in the generation of the cash flows of the Purchased Assets, we are required to account for million of the proceeds from this transaction as a liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet that will be recognized into revenue in proportion to the royalty and milestone payments paid to Ligand over the estimated life of the Ligand Purchase Agreement. The Purchaser Upsize Option is considered a freestanding financial instrument as it is separately exercisable and can be legally transferred from the Ligand Purchase Agreement. As such, it is accounted for as a written option which is accounted for as a liability at fair value and remeasured at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The fair value of the Purchaser Upsize Option at September 30, 2024 was million. The Ligand Warrant is considered a freestanding financial instrument that as it is separately exercisable and can be legally transferred from the Ligand Purchase Agreement, which was determined to be equity-classified under ASC 815. To allocate the proceeds, the Purchaser Upsize Option liability and equity-classified Ligand Warrants were recognized based on their fair values and the residual was allocated to a liability related to the sale of future royalties and milestones on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million of non-cash interest expense related to the Ligand Purchase Agreement. As royalties are remitted to us and milestone and sales are earned from the Purchased Assets, the balance of the recorded liability will be effectively repaid over the life of the Ligand Purchase Agreement. To determine the amortization of the recorded liability, we are required to estimate the total amount of future payments that Ligand is entitled to under the Ligand Purchase Agreement. The sum of these amounts less the million proceeds allocated to the liability related to sale of future royalties and milestones will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the Ligand Purchase Agreement. Periodically, we assess the estimated royalty and milestone payments to be received and sales to be earned under the Ligand Purchase Agreement, and to the extent the amount or timing of the payments is materially different from our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of

The terms of one of our finance lease agreements include a requirement to maintain a specified minimum cash balance. As of September 30, 2024, our cash balance was below this threshold. Despite this, we remain current on all lease payments under the agreement. While the financial institution has the contractual right to take remedial actions, including potentially reclaiming the leased assets, we are actively addressing the situation and expect to regain compliance. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amounts owed under this lease totaled approximately million, with payments scheduled .

Long-term investments are included in "Other long-term assets" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We are required to measure the Purchaser Upsize Option issued under the Ligand Purchase Agreement at fair value. The million fair value of the Purchaser Upsize Option at September 30, 2024, included in "Other current liabilities" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which require it to be reported as a Level 3 liability within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of this liability is determined based on a scenario analysis and uses assumptions we believe would be made by a market participant. We measure our contingent purchase price considerations at fair value. The fair values of our contingent purchase price considerations at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of million, included in "Other long-term liabilities" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, are based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which require them to be reported as Level 3 liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of these liabilities use assumptions we believe would be made by a market participant and are mainly based on estimates from a Monte Carlo simulation of our share price, as well as other factors impacting the probability of triggering the milestone payments. Share price was evolved using a geometric Brownian motion, calculated daily for the life of the contingent purchase price considerations.

 Overview 
 We are a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapies targeting cancer with a robust pipeline of immunological agents. Our mission is to expand patient populations benefiting from cancer immunotherapy through combination approaches, using a broad repertoire of antibody therapeutics, adoptive cell therapies (through our subsidiary MiNK Therapeutics, Inc. MiNK )), and vaccine adjuvants (through our subsidiary SaponiQx, Inc. SaponiQx )). We believe that combination therapies and a deep understanding of each patient s cancer will significantly expand the patient population benefiting from immuno-oncology I-O treatments. 
 In addition to our diverse pipeline, we have established fully integrated capabilities encompassing novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line development, and current good manufacturing practice ("cGMP") manufacturing. We believe these integrated capabilities enable us to develop and, if approved, commercialize novel candidates on accelerated timelines compared to industry standards. Through independent development and strategic partnerships, we leverage our scientific expertise and capabilities to drive innovation in the I-O field. 
 Our I-O portfolio is driven by several platforms and programs, which we plan to utilize individually and in combination: 
 Multiple antibody discovery platforms, including proprietary display technologies, to identify future antibody candidates. 

Antibody candidate programs, including our lead assets, botensilimab (a multifunctional immune cell activator and human Fc-enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody, also known as AGEN1181) and balstilimab (a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody). 

Our saponin-based vaccine adjuvant platform, primarily centered around our STIMULON cultured plant cell cpc QS-21 adjuvant STIMULON cpcQS-21 ). 

A pipeline of novel allogeneic invariant natural killer T cell iNKT therapies for treating cancer and other immune-mediated diseases, controlled by MiNK. 

We regularly evaluate development, commercialization, and partnering strategies for each product candidate based on various factors, including pre-clinical and clinical trial results, competitive positioning, funding requirements, and available resources. Our 
 20 

lead program, botensilimab (AGEN1181), is progressing through multiple clinical programs designed to support accelerated development as a monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab. In April 2023, botensilimab in combination with balstilimab received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for the treatment of patients with not-microsatellite instability-high ("MSI-H")/deficient mismatch repair ("dMMR") metastatic colorectal cancer with no active liver involvement. Patients targeted with this designation are heavily pretreated with standard of care chemotherapy, anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR if RAS wild type. We completed enrollment of patients with refractory MSS mCRC non-active liver metastases ("NLM") in a Phase 1 trial (n~150) and randomized Phase 2 trial (n~230) in October 2023. We are likely not to pursue accelerated approval pathways and intend to initiate a Phase 3 study with plans to ensure continued funding via partnering activities. 
 We have entered into collaborations with several companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMS ), Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. Betta ), UroGen Pharma Ltd. ("UroGen"), Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead ), Incyte Corporation Incyte ), and Merck Sharpe Dohme Merck ). These collaborations, along with our internal programs, have resulted in over a dozen antibody pre-clinical or clinical development programs. 
 Pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Incyte, we have exclusively licensed to Incyte monospecific antibodies targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3 and LAG-3, which Incyte is currently advancing in various clinical trials, as well as an additional undisclosed target that Incyte is advancing in preclinical studies. Under the terms of our agreement, Incyte is responsible for all future development expenses, and we are eligible to receive up to an additional 315.0 million in potential milestone payments plus royalties on any future sales. Incyte has terminated the OX40 program, effective October 2023, and both the GITR program and undisclosed program, effective May 2024. Upon termination, the rights to the OX40, GITR, and undisclosed programs reverted back to us. On July 30, 2024, Incyte announced that it would discontinue further development of the LAG-3 and TIM-3 monoclonal antibodies. 
 Pursuant to our collaboration and license agreement with Merck, we exclusively licensed to Merck a monospecific antibody targeting ILT4 (MK-4830), which Merck advanced in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Merck is responsible for all future development expenses, and we are eligible to receive up to an additional 85.0 million in potential milestone payments, as well as royalties on future sales. In 2024 Merck notified us that the further clinical development of MK-4830 will be limited to a neoadjuvant ovarian study of MK-4830 in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab that is ongoing. 
 In September 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Royalty Fund, LLC, entered into a royalty purchase agreement (the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement with XOMA (US) LLC XOMA ). Pursuant to the terms of the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement, XOMA purchased 33 of all future royalties and 10 of all future milestone payments that we are entitled to receive from Incyte and Merck, net of certain of our obligations to a third party. 
 In December 2018, we entered into collaboration agreements with Gilead for the development and commercialization of up to five novel I-O therapies (the Gilead Collaboration Agreements ). Gilead received worldwide exclusive rights to our bispecific antibody, AGEN1423, and the exclusive option to license AGEN1223, a bispecific antibody, and AGEN2373, a monospecific antibody. Gilead elected to return AGEN1423 to us in November 2020 and terminated the license agreement. We ceased development of AGEN1223 in the third quarter of 2021, and the option and license agreement for AGEN1223 were formally terminated in October 2021. On August 5, 2024, Gilead elected not to exercise the option to license AGEN2373 and the option and license agreement was formally terminated. 
 In November 2019, we entered into a license agreement with UroGen, granting them an exclusive, worldwide license (not including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela and their respective territories and possessions) to develop, manufacture, and commercialize zalifrelimab for the treatment of cancers of the urinary tract via intravesical delivery. We received an upfront payment of 10.0 million and are eligible to receive up to 200.0 million in milestone payments, as well as royalties on future sales. 
 In June 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the Betta License Agreement with Betta, pursuant to which we granted Betta an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize balstilimab and zalifrelimab in Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan Greater China ). Under the terms of the Betta License Agreement, we received 15.0 million upfront and are eligible to receive up to 100.0 million in milestone payments plus royalties on any future sales in Greater China. 
 In May 2021, we entered into a License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with BMS for our pre-clinical anti-TIGIT bispecific antibody program, AGEN1777. BMS received an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize AGEN1777 and its derivatives. We received a non-refundable upfront cash payment of 200.0 million. In October 2021, we achieved a 20.0 million milestone upon the dosing of the first patient in the AGEN1777 Phase 1 clinical trial and in December 2023, we announced that the first patient was dosed in an AGEN1777 Phase 2 clinical trial, triggering the achievement of a 
 21 

25.0 million milestone. We received this milestone in January 2024. On July 30, 2024, we received notice from BMS that it is returning AGEN1777 back to us and voluntarily terminating the BMS License Agreement, effective as of January 26, 2025. 
 In May 2024, we, and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Ligand Purchase Agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Ligand for the sale to Ligand of (i) 31.875 of the development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments we were then eligible to receive under our agreements with BMS, UroGen, Gilead, Merck and Incyte, (the Covered License Agreements (ii) 18.75 of the royalties we receive under the Covered License Agreements; and (iii) a 2.625 synthetic royalty on worldwide net sales of botensilimab and balstilimab (collectively the Purchased Assets ). The total amounts payable to Ligand are subject to a 50 reduction in the event total payments to Ligand exceed a specified return hurdle. The synthetic royalty is subject to a reduction if annual worldwide net sales exceed a specified level, and a cap on annual worldwide net sales if annual worldwide net sales exceed a higher specified level. The synthetic royalty can increase by 1 based on the occurrence of certain future events. After taking into account our obligations under the Ligand Purchase Agreement, XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement and the recent status of our collaboration agreements, we remain eligible to receive up to approximately 136.3 million, 49.4 million and 183.1 million in potential development, regulatory, and commercial milestones from UroGen, Merck and Incyte, respectively. 
 In September 2021, we launched SaponiQx to lead innovation in novel adjuvant discovery and vaccine design, focusing on our saponin-based adjuvants. We are particularly dedicated to the development of the next-generation cultured plant cell QS-21. To support this initiative, we partnered with Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc. to develop SaponiQx s saponin products from sustainably sourced raw materials. Our goal is to meet the demands of the vaccine industry, especially for pandemic vaccines. 
 Our bark extract QS-21 adjuvant is partnered with GSK and plays a vital role in multiple GSK vaccine programs. These programs are at various stages, including GSK s approved shingles and RSV vaccines, SHINGRIX and AREXVY, which received FDA approval in the United States in October 2017 and May 2023, respectively. 
 In January 2018, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and its affiliates HCR ). HCR purchased our worldwide rights to receive royalties from GSK on GSK s sales of vaccines containing our QS-21 adjuvant. We do not incur clinical development costs for products partnered with GSK. 
 Under the agreement with HCR, we were entitled to receive milestone payments based on GSK s vaccine sales. These milestones include 15.1 million upon GSK reaching 2.0 billion in last-twelve-months net sales prior to 2024 (the First HCR Milestone and 25.25 million upon GSK reaching 2.75 billion in last-twelve-months net sales prior to 2026 (the Second HCR Milestone ). We received the First HCR Milestone after GSK s net sales of SHINGRIX for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, exceeded 2.0 billion, and we received the Second HCR Milestone after GSK s net sales of SHINGRIX for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, exceeded 2.75 billion. 
 Our business activities include product research and preclinical and clinical development, intellectual property prosecution, manufacturing, regulatory and clinical affairs, corporate finance and development activities, and support of our collaborations. Our product candidates require successful clinical trials and approvals from regulatory agencies, as well as acceptance in the marketplace. Part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing arrangements with academic and corporate collaborators and licensees and by entering into new collaborations. 
 In October 2021, we completed the initial public offering IPO of MiNK, which trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol INKT . MiNK is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing allogeneic invariant natural killer T iNKT cell therapies to treat cancer and other life-threatening immune diseases. MiNK s most advanced product candidate, agenT-797, is an off-the-shelf, allogeneic, native iNKT cell therapy. MiNK is currently expanding its clinical programs, with a notable externally funded Phase 2 trial in second-line gastric cancer actively enrolling at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Additionally, MiNK is evaluating agenT-797 as a variant-agnostic therapy for patients with viral acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS in planning for a randomized phase 2 study through a predominantly externally financed program. Recently, MiNK secured a 5.8 million private placement financing at a 25 premium, led by GKCC, LLC. This funding will propel the clinical development of MiNK-215, its leading allogeneic CAR-iNKT cell therapy targeting fibroblast activation protein FAP in solid tumors, which is scheduled to enter clinical trials in early 2025. In addition to its lead clinical program, MiNK has announced a collaboration with ImmunoScape, Inc. ImmunoScape to discover and develop next-generation T-cell receptor therapies targeting novel solid tumor antigens. This partnership leverages MiNK's proprietary library of T-cell antigens and ImmunoScape s platform for rapid discovery of novel T-cell receptors. 
 Historical Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 22 

Research and development revenue 
 We did not recognize any research and development revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, but recognized research and development revenue of approximately 3.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development revenues in the third quarter of 2023 primarily consisted of 2.9 million related to the recognition of deferred revenue earned under our Gilead Collaboration Agreements. 
 Non-cash royalty revenue related to the sale of future royalties 
 In January 2018, we sold 100 of our worldwide rights to receive royalties from GSK on sales of GSK s vaccines containing our STIMULON QS-21 adjuvant to HCR. As described in Note F to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, this transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated life of our Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR. As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties are remitted directly to HCR, we record these royalties from GSK as revenue. Non-cash royalty revenue related to our agreement with GSK increased 4.3 million, to approximately 24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 20.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased net sales of GSK s vaccines containing our STIMULON QS-21 adjuvant, including net sales of AREXVY, that GSK launched in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development expense includes the costs associated with our internal research and development activities, including compensation and benefits, occupancy costs, manufacturing costs, costs of consultants, and administrative costs. Research and development expense decreased 20 to 41.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 51.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Decreased expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relate to a 4.2 million decrease in third-party services and other expenses, largely due to the timing of expenses related to the advancement of our antibody programs, a 2.9 million decrease in personnel related expenses, mainly due to a decrease in headcount, and a 4.1 million decrease in expenses attributable to the activities of our subsidiaries. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.8 million increase in other research and development expenses. 
 General and administrative expense 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, facility expenses, and professional fees. General and administrative expenses decreased 9 to 17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Decreased expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relate to a 1.0 million decrease in personnel related expenses, mainly due to decreased share based compensation expense, a 0.7 million decrease in professional fees and a 0.5 million decrease in expenses attributable to the activities of our subsidiaries. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased to approximately 35.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to increased non-cash interest recorded in connection with our Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR and the addition of non-cash interest expense recorded in connection with our Ligand Purchase Agreement. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Research and development revenue 
 We recognized research and development revenue of approximately 0.3 million and 8.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Research and development revenues in the first nine months of 2023 primarily consisted of 7.2 million related to the recognition of deferred revenue earned under our Gilead Collaboration Agreements. 
 Non-cash royalty revenue related to the sale of future royalties 
 In January 2018, we sold 100 of our worldwide rights to receive royalties from GSK on sales of GSK s vaccines containing our STIMULON QS-21 adjuvant to HCR. As described in Note F to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, this transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated life of our Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR. As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties are remitted directly to HCR, we record these royalties from GSK as revenue. Non-cash royalty revenue related to our agreement with GSK increased 13.5 million, to approximately 75.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 61.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased net sales of GSK s vaccines containing our STIMULON QS-21 adjuvant, including net sales of AREXVY, that GSK launched in the third quarter of 2023.

Decreased expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relate to a 25.9 million decrease in third-party services and other expenses, largely due to the timing of expenses related to the advancement of our antibody programs, a 8.9 million decrease in personnel related expenses, mainly due to a decrease in headcount, and a 14.7 million decrease in expenses attributable to the activities of our subsidiaries. These decreases were partially offset by a 3.3 million increase in other research and development expenses. 
 General and administrative expense 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, facility expenses, and professional fees. General and administrative expenses decreased 11 to 50.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 57.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Decreased expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relate to a 3.2 million decrease in personnel related expenses, mainly due to decreased share based compensation expense, a 1.5 million decrease in professional fees and a 2.9 million decrease in expenses attributable to the activities of our subsidiaries. These decreases were partially offset by a 1.0 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. 
 Non-operating income (expense) 
 Non-operating income increased 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from income of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to income of 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the recognition of a 5.3 million gain on the early termination of two operating leases and the recognition of R D tax credits in the UK in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to de minimis activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased to approximately 96.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 53.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to increased non-cash interest recorded in connection with our Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR and the addition of non-cash interest expense recorded in connection with our Ligand Purchase Agreement. 
 Research and Development Programs 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our research and development programs consisted largely of our antibody programs as indicated in the following table (in thousands).

Research and development program costs include compensation and other direct costs plus an allocation of indirect costs, based on certain assumptions and our review of the status of each program. Our product candidates are in various stages of development and significant additional expenditures will be required if we start new clinical trials, encounter delays in our programs, apply for regulatory approvals, continue development of our technologies, expand our operations, and/or bring our product candidates to market. The total cost of any particular clinical trial is dependent on a number of factors such as trial design, length of the trial, number of clinical sites, number of patients, and trial sponsorship. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Because of the current stage of our product candidates, among other factors, we are unable to reliably estimate the cost of completing our research and development programs or the timing for bringing such programs to various markets or substantial partnering or out-licensing arrangements, and, therefore, when, if ever, material cash inflows are likely to commence. 
 24 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred annual operating losses since inception, and we had an accumulated deficit of 2.1 billion as of September 30, 2024. We expect to incur significant losses over the next several years as we continue development of our technologies and product candidates, manage our regulatory processes, initiate and continue clinical trials, and prepare for potential commercialization of products. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through corporate partnerships, advance royalty sales and the issuance of equity. From our inception through September 30, 2024, we have raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately 2.0 billion through the sale of common and preferred stock, the exercise of stock options and warrants, proceeds from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, royalty monetization transactions, and the issuance of convertible and other notes. 
 We maintain an effective registration statement (the Registration Statement covering up to 300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units. The Registration Statement includes prospectuses covering the offer, issuance and sale of up to 20.6 million shares of our common stock from time to time in at-the-market offerings pursuant to an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. as our sales agent. We sold approximately 1.9 million and 1.8 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the period of October 1, 2024 through November 8, 2024, respectively, and received aggregate net proceeds totaling 33.0 million. As of November 8, 2024, approximately 18.1 million shares remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement. 
 We have funded our operations largely from cash received from partners, royalty financing transactions and equity offerings. We transact at-the-market sales from time to time in order to manage our cash balances. We execute at-the-market offerings based on market conditions and our stock price. We do not have in place a program whereby at-the-market offerings are executed automatically based on our trading volume. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had debt outstanding of 13.0 million in principal due February 2025. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were 44.8 million, a decrease of 31.3 million from December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents of our subsidiary, MiNK, at June 30, 2024, were 9.3 million. MiNK cash can only be accessed by Agenus through a declaration of a dividend by the MiNK Board of Directors or through settlement of intercompany balances. 
 Since our founding we have financed our operations principally through income and revenues generated from corporate partnerships, advance royalty sales and proceeds from equity issuances. Based on our current plans and projections, we believe that our cash resources of 44.8 million as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to satisfy our critical liquidity requirements through the end of the year and into 2025. To support operations further, meet our subordinated notes obligation, and to execute on our business plans, we require additional funding. 
 Currently we are in discussions with several entities including biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners, as well as dedicated healthcare funds to provide the funding necessary to support our operations through our planned biologics license application, or marketing authorization, submission for botensilimab/balstilimab. However, because the completion of such transactions is not entirely within our control, in accordance with accounting guidance we are required to disclose that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes Agenus will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
 Management continues to address the Company s liquidity needs and has continued to adjust spending in order to preserve liquidity. In August 2023, we prioritized and focused our resources to accelerate the development, registration, and commercialization of our lead asset postponing all preclinical and other clinical programs and reducing our workforce by approximately 25 . Our CEO, Dr. Garo Armen has elected to receive his base salary and any potential bonus payments in stock rather than cash. We continuously evaluate the likelihood of success of our programs. As such, our decisions to continue to fund or eliminate funding of each of our programs are predicated on these determinations, on an ongoing basis. We expect our sources of funding to include payments from current collaborations which include out-licensing and/or partnering opportunities for our portfolio programs and product candidates with multiple parties; additional third-party agreements; asset sales; further royalty monetization; project financing, and/or sales of equity securities. 
 Our future cash requirements include, but are not limited to, supporting clinical trial and regulatory efforts and continuing our other research and development programs. Since inception, we have entered into various agreements with contract manufacturers, institutions, and clinical research organizations (collectively third party providers to perform pre-clinical activities and to conduct and monitor our clinical studies and trials. Under these agreements, subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable third-party provider, we have estimated our total payments to be 660.4 million over the term of the related activities. Through September 30, 2024, we have expensed 598.1 million as research and development expenses and 562.4 million has been 
 25 

paid under these agreements. The timing of expense recognition and future payments related to these agreements is subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable third-party provider. We plan to enter into additional agreements with third party providers and we anticipate significant additional expenditures will be required to initiate and advance our various programs. 
 Part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing collaboration arrangements with academic and collaboration partners and licensees and by entering into new collaborations. As a result of our collaboration agreements, we will not completely control the efforts to attempt to bring those product candidates to market. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 129.7 million and 183.8 million, respectively. Our future ability to generate cash from operations will depend on achieving regulatory approval and market acceptance of our product candidates, achieving benchmarks as defined in existing collaboration agreements, and our ability to enter into new collaborations. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risks highlighted in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Form 10-K, Part II and Item 1A "Risk Factors" of our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q. 
 Item 3. 	 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposure is foreign currency exchange rate risk. International revenues and expenses are generally transacted by our foreign subsidiaries and are denominated in local currency. Approximately 0.6 and 1.0 of our cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, was from our foreign subsidiaries. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk related to our transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We do not currently employ specific strategies, such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging, to manage these exposures. Our currency exposures vary but are primarily concentrated in the British Pound and Swiss Franc, in large part due to our subsidiaries, Agenus UK Limited and AgenTus Therapeutics Limited, both with operations in England, and Antigenics SA, a company with operations in Switzerland. 
 We had cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 of 44.8 million, which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, and our interest income fluctuates as interest rates change. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as we seek debt financing and invest excess cash. Due to the short-term nature of our investments in money market funds, our carrying value approximates the fair value of these investments at September 30, 2024. 
 There has been no material change to our interest rate exposure and our approach toward interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposures, as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with our investment policy. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs, and maximize yields. We review our investment policy periodically and amend it as deemed necessary. Currently, the investment policy prohibits investing in any structured investment vehicles and asset-backed commercial paper. Although our investments are subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer, or type of investment. We do not invest in derivative financial instruments. Accordingly, we do not believe that there is currently any material market risk exposure with respect to derivatives or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item. 
 Item 4.	 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. It should be noted that any system of controls is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurances that the system will achieve its stated goals under all reasonably foreseeable circumstances. Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective at a level that provides such reasonable assurances.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 27 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1 .	 Legal Proceedings 
 In September 2024, a putative securities class action lawsuit was commenced in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts naming as defendants Agenus and three current officers. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact related to the efficacy and commercial prospects of botensilimab and balstilimab. The plaintiff seeks to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Agenus securities between January 23, 2023, and July 17, 2024. The plaintiff seeks damages and interest, and an award of costs, including attorneys fees. We have not recorded any accrual for a contingent liability associated with these legal proceedings. 
 In September 2024, we received a subpoena from the Boston Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking records relating to certain of our product candidates, correspondence with the FDA, public disclosure, and other matters. We have produced records pursuant to the subpoena. 
 We are not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have a material adverse effect on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A.	 Ri sk Factors 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q. 
 Item 5. 	 Other Information 
 Trading Plans of Our Directors and Officers 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , none of our directors or executive officers or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each item is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
