million to million, eliminated the requirement that the Company have net tangible
assets of at least at the time of the closing, and reduced the Minimum Cash Condition (as defined in the Visiox Merger Agreement)
from million to . 

On
July 19, 2024, the Company delivered written notice to Visiox of its election to terminate the Visiox Merger Agreement and abandoned
the transactions contemplated thereby, primarily because the conditions to closing set forth in the Visiox Merger Agreement were not
satisfied or waived by June 30, 2024. 

On
August 26, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time, the Aspire Merger Agreement with PowerUp Merger Sub II, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), the New
Sponsor, Stephen Quesenberry, in the capacity as the seller representative, and Aspire Biopharma, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation Aspire ).
The transactions contemplated by the Aspire Merger Agreement are intended to serve as the Company s initial Business Combination. 

On
September 5, 2024, and in connection with the due diligence process, the parties entered into an amendment agreement (the First
Aspire Amendment Agreement ). The First Aspire Amendment Agreement: (i) adjusted the merger consideration to be consistent with
the aggregate post-closing ownership percentage of the Aspire stockholders that the parties had anticipated to be reflected in the consummation
of the proposed business combination, (ii) adjusted the size of the pool of available equity in the equity incentive plan for the initial
fiscal year following closing to be consistent with what the parties had anticipated to be reflected in the consummation of the proposed
business combination, and (iii) provided additional time for the parties to deliver disclosure schedules and conduct due diligence reviews. 

On
October 9, 2024, and in connection with the due diligence process, the parties entered into another amendment agreement (the Second
Aspire Amendment Agreement ), which provided additional time for the parties to deliver disclosure schedules and conduct due diligence
reviews. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. Substantially all activity from February 9, 2021 (inception) through
September 30, 2024 relates to the Company s formation and initial public offering IPO ), which is described below
and, since the IPO, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination, the negotiation of the Visiox Merger Agreement, actions
taken until July 19, 2024 to advance the previously anticipated business combination with Visiox, the negotiation of the Aspire Merger
Agreement and actions taken to advance the anticipated business combination with Aspire. The Company will not generate any operating
revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income
in the form of interest income earned on investments from the proceeds derived from the IPO. The registration statement for the Company s
IPO was declared effective on February 17, 2022. On February 23, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of units Units 
and, with respect to Class A ordinary shares included in the Units offered, the Public Shares at per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of , which is discussed in Note 3. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of private placement warrants Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Company s original sponsor, PowerUp Sponsor LLC
(the Original Sponsor and, together with the New Sponsor, the Sponsors generating gross proceeds of 
which is described in Note 4. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the closing of the sale of additional Units upon receiving notice of the
underwriter s election to fully exercise its overallotment option (the Overallotment Units ), generating additional
gross proceeds of . Simultaneously with the exercise of the overallotment, the Company consummated the private placement of
an additional Private Placement Warrants to the Original Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of . 

Offering
costs for the IPO amounted to , consisting of of underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees payable
(which are held in the Trust Account (defined below)) and of other costs. As described in Note 6, the of deferred
underwriting fee payable was contingent upon the consummation of a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
On June 28, 2023, the underwriters of the IPO, agreed to waive their entitlements to the deferred underwriting commissions of 
pursuant to the underwriting agreement for the IPO (the Underwriting Agreement ). As a result, was recorded
to additional paid-in capital in relation to the waiver of the deferred underwriting discount in the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements (see Note 6). 

Following
the closing of the IPO, per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units, Overallotment Units, and the Private
Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account Trust Account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the
meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with
a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company
meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company,
until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.
To mitigate the risk that the Company might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, in January
2024, the Company instructed the trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust
Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of the consummation of an initial Business Combination
or the Company s liquidation. 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale
of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company
must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least of the assets held in the
Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time it
enters into a definitive agreement for the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination
if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires
a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. There is no assurance the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

The
Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting
called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to
redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public
Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There are no redemption rights with respect to the
Company s warrants. 

All
of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s
liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company s Business Combination and in connection
with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Memorandum and
Articles of Association ). In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 Subtopic 10-S99, redemption
provisions not solely within the control of a company require Class A ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside
of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., Public Warrants), the initial
carrying value of the Public Shares classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20
 Debt with Conversion and other Options . The Public Shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity
instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from
the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest
redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying
amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the
changes immediately. The Public Shares are redeemable and are classified as such on the consolidated balance sheet until such date that
a redemption event takes place. 

Redemptions
of the Company s Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to
an agreement relating to an initial Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination, the Company
will proceed with the Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such
other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing
requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to
its Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however,
shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides
to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation
pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with
a Business Combination, the Original Sponsor agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased
during or after the IPO in favor of the Business Combination. The New Sponsor is subject to this same obligation. Additionally, each
Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for
or against the proposed Business Combination. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder
or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of or more of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the IPO, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
Company s Original Sponsor, and its initial officers and directors (the Initial Shareholders agreed not to propose
an amendment to the Memorandum and Articles of Association that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation
to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders
with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment. The New Sponsor and the Company s
current officers and directors are subject to this same obligation. 

On
May 18, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the 2023 Extension Meeting ). At the 2023
Extension Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and
Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from May 23, 2023 to
May 23, 2024 (the 2023 Extension Amendment ). In connection with the approval of the 2023 Extension Amendment, holders of
 of the Company s Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price
of per share, for an aggregate of approximately million. 

Following
the 2023 Extension Meeting, on May 18, 2023, those Initial Shareholders holding all of the issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares
of the Company elected to convert their Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares of the Company on a one-for-one basis. As
a result, of the Company s Class B ordinary shares were cancelled and of the Company s Class A ordinary
shares were issued to converting Class B shareholders. 

On
August 14, 2023, the Company was notified by Equiniti Trust Company, LLC that the per share redemption price for the redemption of Public
Shares effected on May 18, 2023 should have been approximately , which was approximately higher than the approximately 
per share previously paid. The Company made a true-up payment in the amount of approximately per share to the holders
of record as of April 19, 2023 that exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account.
On August 18, 2023, the Company made the true-up payment to the applicable holders in the aggregate amount of . 

On
April 13, 2023, the Company engaged J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC, acting through its Cohen Company Markets division CCM to act as its capital markets advisor in connection with seeking an extension for completing a Business Combination. The Company will
pay CCM the sum of (i) plus (ii) Class A ordinary shares of the Company which is payable at the close of a Business Combination.
On July 13, 2023, the Company amended the agreement with CCM. As a result of the amendment, the Company will issue to CCM Class
A ordinary shares of the Company, which are payable at the close of a Business Combination. 

On
August 18, 2023, in connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (defined below), each then
serving director tendered their resignations as members of the board of directors of the Company (the Board ), each then
serving executive officer resigned from their positions as officers of the Company, and new persons were appointed to serve as officers
and directors of the Company. 

On
May 22, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the 2024 Extension Meeting ). At the 2024
Extension Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and
Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from May 23, 2024 to
February 17, 2025 (the 2024 Extension Amendment ). In connection with the approval of the 2024 Extension Amendment, holders
of of the Company s Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price
of per share, for an aggregate of approximately million. 

In
connection with the 2024 Extension Meeting, the Company and the New Sponsor entered into a non-redemption agreement (the 2024
Non-Redemption Agreement with an unaffiliated third-party shareholder in exchange for such shareholder agreeing not to redeem
(or to validly rescind any redemption requests on) of the Company s Class A ordinary shares (the 2024 Non-Redeemed
Shares in connection with the 2024 Extension Meeting. In exchange for the commitment not to redeem the Non-Redeemed Shares,
the New Sponsor has agreed to transfer to such shareholder Class A ordinary shares of the Company held by the New Sponsor and
 Class A ordinary shares which will be issued to the New Sponsor upon the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination.
The 2024 Non-Redemption Agreement increased the amount of funds that remained in the Company s Trust Account following the 2024
Extension Meeting. 

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by February 17, 2025, and in the absence of the Company s shareholders
approving an additional extension to the Company s term, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share
price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held
in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay the Company s franchise and income taxes (less up to of
interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject
to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s
remaining shareholders and the Company s Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the requirements of applicable
law. 

The
Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete
a Business Combination by February 17, 2025, or during any additional extension period (the Combination Period ). However,
if the Initial Shareholders acquired Public Shares in or after the IPO, they are entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust
Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The
underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account. In the
event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, it is possible that the per share value of
the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be approximately per share held
in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsors have agreed to be liable to the Company
if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with
which the Company has discussed entering into a Business Combination, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability
will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in
or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover,
in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsors will not be responsible to the
extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsors will have to indemnify
the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements
waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Going
Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had 0 in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of . As of September
30, 2024, the Company had in its Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its Class
A ordinary shares in connection therewith. As of September 30, 2024, of the amount in the Trust Account are represented as
Interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account. 

The
Company initially had 15 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate an initial Business Combination. At the 2024 Extension Meeting,
the Company s shareholders approved the 2024 Extension Amendment that served to extend the date by which the Company must consummate
its initial Business Combination to February 17, 2025. The remaining life of the Company as of September 30, 2024 is under
12 months. 

Until
the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using any funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating an initial Business Combination. The Company may need to
raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its New Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties.
The Company s officers, directors and New Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at
any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly,
the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. 

If
the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could
include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead
expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at
all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period
of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked
securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in the IPO and related to the closing of the initial Business

an as-converted basis, of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of the IPO (irrespective
of whether or not such ordinary shares are redeemed in connection with the initial Business Combination) plus all Class A ordinary shares

months from the closing
of the IPO. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company will not be obligated to deliver any ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle
such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the ordinary shares underlying the warrants
is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration.
No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders
seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities
laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption is available. 

The
Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination,
it will use its best efforts to file, and within 60 business days following a Business Combination to have declared effective, a registration
statement covering the offer and sale of the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants. The Company will use its best efforts
to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating
thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. No warrants will be exercisable
for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the offer and sale of the ordinary shares issuable
upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration
statement covering the offer and sale of the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified
period following the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants
on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available.
If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. 

Once
the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the warrants: 

in
 whole and not in part; 

at
 a price of per warrant; 

upon
 not less than prior written notice of redemption, to each warrant holder; and 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Public Shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions,
 share consolidations, share capitalizations, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading
 days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date the Company sends the notice of redemption
 to the warrant holders. 

If
and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares upon
exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable
to effect such registration or qualification. 

If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the
Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for
issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash
settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates
the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will
they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly,
the warrants may expire worthless. 

In
addition, if (x) the Company issues additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per Public Share (with
such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors and, in the case of
any such issuance to the Sponsors or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsors or such affiliates,
as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent
more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company s initial Business Combination
on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading
price of the Company s ordinary shares during the trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the
Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, the exercise
price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued
Price and the per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of
the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. 

The
Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement
Warrants and the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable, or saleable
until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. 

The
Company has determined that warrants issued in connection with its IPO in February 2022 are subject to treatment as equity. In order
to account for the fair value of the Public Warrants issued in the IPO, the Company used Black Scholes Model to allocate cost to the
Public Warrants on IPO. The key assumptions in the option pricing model utilized are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility,
expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected volatility as of the IPO closing date was derived from observable
public warrant pricing on comparable blank check companies that recently went public in 2020 and 2021. The risk-free interest
rate is based on the interpolated U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield. The expected term of the warrants is assumed to be 
until the close of a Business Combination, and the contractual five-year term subsequently. The dividend rate is based on the historical
rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero.

discussed in Note 6, the fair values of the subscription liabilities related to advances made to, or on behalf of the Company under such
agreements, are classified and accounted for as a financial liability of which will be measured at fair value on a recurring basis (one
of the instruments is accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis under ASC 480-10, as a derivative instrument under ASC 815, or
at fair value under the fair value option in ASC 825-10). 

The
Financial Liabilities are valued under a PWERM which fair values repayable capital investment and used a Black Scholes Model that fair
values the conversion features within the convertible debt. The PWERM is a multistep process in which value is estimated based on the
probability-weighted present value of various future outcomes. The estimated fair value of the Financial Liabilities Component is determined
using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in the pricing models are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life and risk-free
interest rate.

terms of the Visiox Merger Agreement, the New Sponsor was owed a fee upon the successful closing of the business combination
between the Company and Visiox as consideration for the significant risk taken by New Sponsor in entering into the Visiox Promissory
Note (the Original Promissory Note Fee ). The Company and New Sponsor agreed that New Sponsor should be compensated for
that risk despite the termination of the right to receive the Original Promissory Note Fee as a result of the termination of the Visiox
Merger Agreement. As consideration for the foregoing, the Company agreed to pay New Sponsor a modified promissory note fee of

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated on February 9, 2021 as a Cayman Islands corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a
merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar transaction Business Combination with one or more businesses or entities. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector, or geographical
location, we have focused, and intend to focus, on industries that complement our management s background and to capitalize on
the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business. We may pursue a transaction in which our shareholders immediately,
prior to completion of our initial Business Combination, would collectively own a minority interest in the combined post-Business Combination
company. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
a Business Combination will be successful. 

Results
of Operations 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. From February 9, 2021 (inception) until the Company s initial
public offering on February 23, 2022, the Company s entire activity was in preparation for an initial public offering, and following
the Company s IPO through September 30, 2024, the Company s entire activity has been limited to the search for a prospective
initial Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination
at the earliest. We incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing
compliance), as well as expenses for due diligence efforts. Our operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses necessary
to operate and maintain the Company as we pursue one or more Business Combinations. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 537,019, which consisted of operating expenses of 630,772, interest
expense associated with the debt discount of 8,496, offset by interest earned on investments held in Trust Account of 76,746 and other
income of 25,503. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 69,258, which consisted of operating expenses
of 324,742, offset by interest income of 255,484. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 3,606,378, which consisted of operating expenses of 3,654,462, interest
expense associated with the debt discount of 399,990 and other expense of 33,437, offset by interest earned on investments held in
Trust Account of 481,511. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 there was a 2,000,000 subscription agreement expense recognized
as part of the Visiox Merger Agreement which is included in general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended September
30, 2023, we had a net income of 4,614,992, which consisted of operating expenses of 937,553, offset by interest income of 5,552,545.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Until
the consummation of the IPO, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of Founder Shares by the Original Sponsor and loans
from the Original Sponsor. 

On
February 23, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of 25,000,000 units Units with respect to the ordinary shares included
in the Units being offered (the Public Shares at 10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds of 250,000,000. Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 9,138,333 private placement warrants Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Original Sponsor generating gross proceeds of 13,707,500.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the closing of the sale of 3,750,000 additional Units upon receiving
notice of the underwriter s election to fully exercise its overallotment option (the Overallotment Units ), generating
additional gross proceeds of 37,500,000. Simultaneously with the exercise of the overallotment, the Company consummated the private
placement of an additional 625,000 Private Placement Warrants to the Original Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 937,500. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 2,826,804, net cash provided by investing activities
was 13,781,323 and net cash used in financing activities was 10,954,519. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 496,979, net cash provided by investing activities
was 284,916,127 and net cash used in financing activities was 284,916,127. 

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust
Account (less taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions), to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest
income (if any) to pay taxes, if any. Our annual tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the
amounts held in the Trust Account. We expect the interest income earned on the amount in the Trust Account (if any) will be sufficient
to pay our taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business
Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had 0 in its operating bank account, 6,601,357 held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business
Combination or to repurchase or redeem its Ordinary Shares in connection therewith and working capital deficit of 6,511,072. 

The
Company has until February 17, 2025 to consummate an initial Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipates that it may not
be able to consummate an initial Business Combination prior to February 17, 2025, its shareholders may vote by special resolution to
amend the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the period of time that the Company has
to consummate the initial Business Combination (any such extended period of time, an Extension Period ). 

Until
the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. The Company may need to raise
additional capital through loans or additional investments from New Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The
Company s officers, directors and New Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any
time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly,
the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. Unless the shareholders vote for an additional extension, the remaining life
of the Company as of September 30, 2024 is under 12 months. 

If
the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could
include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead
expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at
all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period
of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

an aggregate of 7,187,500 Founder Shares. The share dividend was retroactively restated. Since the underwriters exercised their
overallotment option in full upon IPO, none of the Founder Shares were forfeited. 

The
Founder Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described below.

The
Initial Shareholders have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the
earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (B) subsequent to the initial Business
Combination, (x) if the last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits,
share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing
at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital
share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company s shareholders having the right to exchange their
Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. 

On
August 18, 2023, the New Sponsor purchased from the Original Sponsor (x) 4,317,500 Class A Ordinary Shares and (y) 6,834,333 Private
Placement Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of 1.00, payable at the time of the initial Business Combination. 

Private
Placement

February 23, 2022, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option
in full, the Company consummated the issuance and sale of 9,763,333 Private Placement Warrants in a private placement transaction at
a price of 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of 14,645,000. Each whole Private Placement Warrant is exercisable
for one whole Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants was
added to the proceeds from the IPO to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the
Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Warrants are non-redeemable and exercisable
on a cashless basis.

Party Loans 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the New Sponsor or an affiliate of the New Sponsor, or
certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working
Capital Loans ). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the
proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside
the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the
Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital
Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s
discretion, up to 1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity
at a price of 1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, 449,214 and 250,000 in Working Capital Loans were outstanding, respectively. 

On
December 21, 2023, the Company entered into a Loan and Transfer Agreement with the New Sponsor and SSVK, pursuant to which SSVK loaned
an aggregate of 250,000 to the New Sponsor, and, in turn, the New Sponsor loaned 250,000 to the Company. As of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, there was 250,000 and 155,848 in borrowings under the agreement, respectively. The debt discount is being amortized
to interest expense as a non-cash charge over the term of the loan and transfer liability, in which is generally the Company s
expected Business Combination date at the time of each draw. The remaining balance of the debt discount as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023 amounted to 0 and 143,464, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded
 0 and 229,919, respectively, of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount. 

On
January 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Loan and Transfer Agreement with the New Sponsor and Apogee, pursuant to which Apogee loaned
an aggregate of 50,000 to the New Sponsor, and, in turn, the New Sponsor loaned the 50,000 to the Company. 

On
January 10, 2024, the Company entered into a Loan and Transfer Agreement with the New Sponsor and Jinal Sheth Sheth ),
pursuant to which Sheth loaned an aggregate of 150,000 to the New Sponsor and the New Sponsor loaned 150,000 to the Company. As of
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 199,214 and 0, respectively, in aggregate borrowings under the Loan and Transfer

remaining balance of the debt discount as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to 12,930 and 0, respectively. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 8,496 and 170,071, respectively, of interest expense related
to the amortization of the debt discount. 

On
March 5, 2024, the Company entered into the First Subscription Agreement with the New Sponsor, Visiox, the Affiliate, and the four separate
Investors, whereby the Investors collectively contributed to New Sponsor the 1,000,000 First Contribution. 

On
May 9, 2024, the Company entered into the Second Subscription Agreement with the New Sponsor, the Affiliate, and the four separate Investors,
whereby, the Investors collectively contributed to New Sponsor the 500,000 Second Contribution and, in turn, the New Sponsor loaned
the 500,000 May Loan to the Company. 

Administrative
Services Fee 

We
agreed, commencing on the effective date of the IPO through the earlier of our consummation of a Business Combination or our liquidation,
to pay an affiliate of the Original Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, secretarial and administrative services. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has incurred 30,000 and 90,000, respectively, of expenses under
this arrangement. 

23 

Deferred
Underwriting Fees 

The
underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per unit, or 5,000,000 in the aggregate at the closing of the IPO. The
underwriters agreed to defer the cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per share related to the over-allotment to be paid at Business Combination 750,000 in the aggregate). In addition, the underwriters were entitled to a deferred underwriting commissions of 0.35 per unit, or
 10,062,500 from the closing of the IPO. The total deferred fee was 10,812,500 consisting of the 10,062,500 deferred portion and the
 750,000 cash discount agreed to be deferred until Business Combination. The deferred fee was to become payable to the underwriters from
the amounts held in the Trust Account solely if the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting
agreement. 

On
June 28, 2023, the underwriters agreed to waive their entitlements to the deferred underwriting commissions of 10,812,500 pursuant to
the underwriting agreement for the IPO (the Underwriting Agreement ). As a result, 10,812,500 was recorded to additional
paid-in capital in relation to the waiver of the deferred underwriting discount in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements (see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report). 

Due
to affiliate 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 328,939 and 238,939, respectively, has been accrued and shown as Due to affiliate 
in the accompanying balance sheet for the administrative services fees described above and a residual balance due from IPO proceeds.
The amount is due to New Sponsor and will be repaid as soon as practical from the Company s operating account. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into
any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities,
or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and income and expenses
during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting
policies: 

Warrant
Instruments 

The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments 
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the instruments are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480,
meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification
under ASC 815, including whether the instruments are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares and whether the instrument holders
could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions
for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance
and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the instruments are outstanding. The Company determined, upon further review
of the warrant agreement, that the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued pursuant to the warrant agreement qualify for
equity accounting treatment. 

Ordinary
shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

We
account for our ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability
instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that features redemption
rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our
ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain
future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders 
deficit section of our balance sheets. 

Net
Income (loss) Per Share of Ordinary shares 

We
apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net income per share of the Class A shares, basic and diluted is calculated
by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account by the weighted average number of shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding
since original issuance. Net income per share of ordinary shares, basic and diluted, for Class B ordinary shares is calculated by dividing
the net income, less income attributable to shares of Class A ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of shares of Class B ordinary
shares outstanding for the periods presented.

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires
disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among
other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated
financial statements and disclosures. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay an affiliate of the Original Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial, and administrative
support services provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on February 23, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees monthly
until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the Company s liquidation. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. 

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of
a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating
its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements
for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and are allowed to comply with new or revised
accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption
of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates
on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our consolidated financial statements may
not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation
report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all
of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or
a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements
(auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive
compensation and performance and comparisons of executive compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions apply for a
period of five years following the completion of the IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever
is earlier.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Pursuant
to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as
it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives
will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or
by the collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, the company identified a material weakness in our internal controls over debt discount,
amortization and debt in financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial
reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investors.
