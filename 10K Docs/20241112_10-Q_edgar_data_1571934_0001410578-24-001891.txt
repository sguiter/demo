In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company received an initial grace period of calendar days, or until October 23, 2023 (the Initial Compliance Period ), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On October 24, 2023, the Company received a second written notice from Nasdaq, notifying the Company that it had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the Initial Compliance Period and granting the Company an additional grace period of calendar days, or until April 22, 2024, to regain compliance.

Reverse Stock Split On April 4, 2024, the Company effected the Reverse Stock Split.

Liquidity Uncertainties As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to million at December 31, 2023. The Company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents, approximately million as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, will be sufficient to support its projected operating requirements and financial commitments for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report. The operating requirements include the current development plans for Bryostatin-1, the Company s novel drug candidate targeting the activation of Protein Kinase C Epsilon and other development projects. The financial commitments include the potential redemption of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock for cash. The Company expects to need additional capital in order to initiate and pursue potential additional development projects, including the continuing development beyond the ongoing Phase 2 trial of Bryostatin-1. Any additional equity financing, if available, may not be on favorable terms and would likely be significantly dilutive to the Company s current stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If the Company is able to access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates that the Company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own, on terms that are not favorable to the Company. The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will likely have a materially adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company s purchase of the Preferred Shares, the Initial Convertible Notes and the Milestone Convertible Notes is herein referred to as the Investment. If Cannasoul fails to achieve a Milestone, the Company will not be obligated to purchase the applicable Milestone Convertible Note. If Cannasoul achieves a Milestone and the Company fails to purchase the applicable Milestone Convertible Note, Cannasoul will have the right to convert all the Company s Preferred Shares into Cannasoul s ordinary shares and the Company will lose certain board appointment rights and certain rights in Cannasoul s subsidiaries.

The Company s investment in the Preferred Shares represents an investment in an equity security in accordance with ASC 320. The Preferred Shares are convertible at any time after the date of issuance, automatically upon a payment default, an IPO, or the written consent of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Shares.

The Company has elected to record the equity in earnings of the equity method investment on a three-month lag which is recognized in other comprehensive income. As a result, the Company recorded losses of and on its equity method investment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Cannasoul Convertible Notes are not traded in active markets and the fair value was determined using a probability weighted scenario-based model. The Cannasoul Convertible Notes are accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security based on Level 3 inputs, which consist of unobservable inputs and reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset (i.e., implied market rate, risk free rate, share price, and probability of scenarios).

Basis of Presentation The unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in the financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company with product candidates in pre-clinical and clinical development. We began operations in October 2012. We are principally focused on developing a product platform based upon a drug candidate called Bryostatin-1 for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease, which is in the clinical testing stage. We are also evaluating Bryostatin-1 for other neurodegenerative or cognitive diseases and dysfunctions, such as Fragile X syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, and Niemann-Pick Type C disease, which have undergone pre-clinical testing. Neurotrope, our predecessor company, had been a party to a technology license and services agreement with the original Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute (which has been known as Cognitive Research Enterprises, Inc. since October 2016), and its affiliate NRV II, LLC, which we collectively refer to herein as CRE, pursuant to which we now have an exclusive non-transferable license to certain patents and technologies required to develop our proposed products. We were formed for the primary purpose of commercializing the technologies initially developed by BRNI for therapeutic applications for AD or other cognitive dysfunctions. These technologies have been under development by BRNI since 1999 and, until March 2013, had been financed through funding from a variety of non-investor sources (which include not-for-profit foundations, the NIH, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and individual philanthropists). From March 2013 forward, development of the licensed technology has been funded principally through us in collaboration with CRE. November 2022 Private Placement On November 17, 2022, we entered into the Series B Purchase Agreement with the Series B Investors, pursuant to which we agreed to sell to the Series B Investors (i) an aggregate of 15,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and (ii) Series B Warrants to acquire up to an aggregate of 77,419 shares of Common Stock. We received total gross proceeds of approximately 15 million from the Series B Offering.

The higher legal fees for 2023 is based upon the prior year s increased fees for special stockholder vote requirements and for regulatory compliance; 258,990 was incurred for outside operations consulting services during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 247,344 for the comparable period in 2023; 26,226 was incurred for travel expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 48,148 for the comparable period in 2023 as Company officers and directors conducted overseas due diligence for strategic investments; 95,314 was incurred for investor relations services during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 62,643 for the comparable period in 2023; 58,995 was incurred for professional fees associated with auditing, financial, accounting and tax advisory services during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 59,812 for the comparable period in 2023; 161,467 was incurred for insurance during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 190,786 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower premiums; 102,986 was incurred for utilities, supplies, license fees, filing costs, rent, advertising and other during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 112,728 for the comparable period in 2023; and 3,791 was recorded as non-cash stock options compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 15,064 for the comparable period in 2023, as options granted during the 2023 period partially vested upon issuance. Other Income / Expense We recognized total other loss of 4,382,344 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to total other income of 2,192,995 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted, for 2024 and 2023, of interest income on funds deposited in interest bearing money market accounts and investments in short-term US treasury bills and changes in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities and offering costs. The decrease in interest income and unrealized gains on treasury bills totaling 249,314 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the decrease in cash balances over the period and lower interest rates. The total increased loss is primarily attributable to the increase in change in fair value of derivative liability of 892,000 and the increase in fair value of warrant liability of 991,000, loss on issuance of Series C Preferred Stock of approximately 3.8 million, warrant issuance costs of 618,375 and share of loss in equity investment of 12,025. Net loss We recognized losses of 5,742,013 and income of 763,203 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increased loss was primarily attributable to the increase in research and development expenses and the increase in other loss partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses. Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Operating Expenses Overview Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4,632,130 as compared to 6,181,446 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 25.1 . The decrease in total operating expenses is due to the decrease in research and development and general and administrative expenses. Research and Development Expenses For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 1,174,214 in research and development expenses as compared to 1,397,031 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 15.9 . These expenses were incurred primarily in connection with developing the potential AD therapeutic product and the initiation of the MS trial with Cleveland Clinic. Of these expenses, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 697,899 was incurred principally relating to our current MS clinical trial and our storage of drug product, 426,523 for clinical consulting services, 22,107 of amortization of prepaid licensing fees relating to the Stanford License Agreement and Mount Sinai Agreement, 27,685 for development of alternative drug supply with Stanford University; comparatively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 938,003 was incurred principally relating to our confirmatory clinical trial and related storage of drug product, 252,752 for clinical consulting services, 15,288 of amortization of prepaid licensing fees relating to the Stanford License Agreement and Mount Sinai Agreement, 41,399 for development of alternative drug supply with Stanford University and 149,589 of non-cash stock options compensation expense. Our research and development expenses have decreased as our current Phase 2 clinical trial for AD was concluded by the end of 2023 and our Phase 2 dose ranging study was discontinued while we initiated our MS clinical trial. Other development expenses might increase, as our resources permit, in order to advance our potential products. We are continuing to determine how to proceed with respect to our other current development programs for Bryostatin-1. General and Administrative Expenses We incurred 3,457,916 and 4,784,415 of general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of approximately 27.7 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 986,382 was incurred primarily for wages, bonuses, vacation pay, severance, taxes and insurance, versus 948,689 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 397,123 was incurred for legal expenses versus 673,882 for the 2023 comparable period. The higher legal fees for 2023 is based upon the prior year s increased fees for special stockholder vote requirements and for regulatory compliance; 751,761 was incurred for outside operations consulting services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 720,159 for the comparable period in 2023; 83,412 was incurred for travel expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 122,196 for the comparable period in 2023 as Company officers and directors conducted overseas due diligence for strategic investments; 316,249 was incurred for investor relations services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 303,271 for the comparable period in 2023; 214,192 was incurred for professional fees associated with auditing, financial, accounting and tax advisory services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 245,021 for the comparable period in 2023; 470,695 was incurred for insurance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 577,950 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower premiums; 216,433 was incurred for utilities, supplies, license fees, filing costs, rent, advertising and other during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 348,575 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to credits for franchise taxes paid during the 2023 period credited to 2024; and 21,618 was recorded as non-cash stock options compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 844,672 for the comparable period in 2023, as options granted during the 2023 period partially vested upon issuance. Other Income / Expense We recognized total other loss of 2,589,891 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to total other income of 1,138,911 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted, for 2024 and 2023, of interest income on funds deposited in interest bearing money market accounts and investments in short-term US treasury bills and changes in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities and offering costs. The decrease in interest income and unrealized gains on treasury bills totaling 278,927 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the decrease in cash balances over the period and lower interest rates. The total decreased income is primarily attributable to the increase in change in fair value of warrant liability of 314,000, loss on issuance of Series C Preferred Stock of approximately 3.8 million, warrant issuance costs of 618,375 and share of loss in equity investment of 30,475 partially offset by the change in fair value of deriviate liability of 1,091,000.

 Net loss We recognized losses of 7,222,021 and 5,042,535 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increased loss was primarily attributable to the increase in other loss partially offset by the decrease in research and development and general and administrative expenses. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Working Capital Since inception, we have incurred negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 21,939,418 as compared to working capital of 26,256,291 as of December 31, 2023. The 4,316,873 decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to approximately 4.6 million of operating expenses and redemptions of Series B preferred stock of approximately 8.8 million, partially offset by the dncrease in preferred stock liabilities of approximately 3.4 million, net proceeds from Series C preferred stock offering of approximately 4.5 million, non-cash expenses of approximately 0.1 million and interest income of approximately 1.1 million. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents of approximately 18.3 million will be sufficient to support our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which would include the continuing development of Bryostatin-1, our novel drug candidate targeting the activation of PKC , our initiation and possible development of a therapeutic for MS and other possible therapeutics. We expect to require additional capital in order to initiate, pursue and complete all potential AD clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval of one or more therapeutic candidates. However, additional future funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to access additional funds when needed, we may not be able to initiate, pursue and complete all planned clinical trials or continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and operations. Any additional equity financing, if available, may not be available on favorable terms, would most likely be significantly dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, and may involve restrictive covenants. If we are able to access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would likely materially harm our business and financial condition. Sources and Uses of Liquidity We expect to continue to incur expenses, resulting in losses and negative cash flows from operations, over at least the next several years as we continue to develop AD and other therapeutic products. We anticipate that this development may include clinical trials in addition to our current ongoing clinical trial and additional research and development expenditures.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not applicable to a smaller reporting company. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to: inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives in the areas over certain payroll and banking systems and user access controls; ineffective processes over period end financial disclosure and reporting including documentation of GAAP disclosure and reporting reviews supporting the financial reporting process and changes to chart of accounts; and ineffective information technology (IT) general computing controls including lack of risk and design assessments supporting IT security policies and procedures, user access, and IT controls within third party contracts. These weaknesses may affect management s ability to determine if errors or inappropriate actions have taken place. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible changes in our disclosure controls and procedures. We previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that our management, including our Chairman of the Board, principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US generally accepted accounting principles. Based on management s review, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2024. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that financial statements, and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
