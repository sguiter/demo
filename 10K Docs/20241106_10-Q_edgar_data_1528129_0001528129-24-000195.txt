 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Various statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements include statements, projections and estimates concerning our operations, performance, business strategy, oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, drilling program capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, the timing and success of specific projects, outcomes and effects of litigation, claims and disputes, derivative activities and potential financing. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "potential," "could," "may," "will," "foresee," "plan," "goal," "should," "intend," "pursue," "target," "continue," "suggest" or the negative thereof or other variations thereof or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Among the factors that significantly impact our business and could impact our business in the future are: 
 the volatility of oil, NGL and natural gas prices, including our area of operation in the Permian Basin; 
 continuing and/or worsening inflationary pressures and associated changes in monetary policy that may cause costs to rise; 
 changes in domestic and global production, supply and demand for oil, NGL and natural gas, and actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members and other oil exporting nations ("OPEC+"); 
 our ability to execute our strategies, including our ability to successfully identify and consummate strategic acquisitions at purchase prices that are accretive to our financial results and to successfully integrate acquired businesses, assets and properties; 
 our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, including effectively managing our expanded acreage; 
 reduced demand due to shifting market perception towards the oil and gas industry; 
 our ability to optimize spacing, drilling and completions techniques in order to maximize our rate of return, cash flows from operations and stockholder value; 
 the ongoing instability and uncertainty in the United States ("U.S.") and international energy, financial and consumer markets that could adversely affect the liquidity available to us and our customers and the demand for commodities, including oil, NGL and natural gas; 
 competition in the oil and gas industry; 
 our ability to discover, estimate, develop and replace oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and inventory; 
 insufficient transportation capacity in the Permian Basin and challenges associated with such constraint, and the availability and costs of sufficient gathering, processing, storage and export capacity; 
 a decrease in production levels which may impair our ability to meet our contractual obligations and ability to retain our leases; 
 risks associated with the uncertainty of potential drilling locations and plans to drill in the future; 
 the inability of significant customers to meet their obligations; 
 revisions to our reserve estimates as a result of changes in commodity prices, decline curves and other uncertainties; 
 the availability and costs of drilling and production equipment, supplies, labor and oil and natural gas processing and other services; 
 the effects, duration and other implications of, including government response to, widespread epidemic or pandemic diseases;

 ongoing war and political instability in Ukraine, Israel and the Middle East and the effects of such conflicts on the global hydrocarbon market and supply chains; 
 loss of senior management or other key personnel; 
 risks related to the geographic concentration of our assets; 
 capital requirements for our operations and projects; 
 our ability to hedge commercial risk, including commodity price volatility, and regulations that affect our ability to hedge such risks; 
 our ability to continue to maintain the borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined herein) or access other means of obtaining capital and liquidity, especially during periods of sustained low commodity prices; 
 our ability to comply with restrictions contained in our debt agreements, including our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, as well as debt that could be incurred in the future; 
 our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, fund our capital requirements and generate future profits; 
 drilling and operating risks, including risks related to hydraulic fracturing activities and those related to inclement or extreme weather, impacting our ability to produce existing wells and/or drill and complete new wells over an extended period of time; 
 the impact of legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address induced seismicity on our ability to conduct our operations; 
 U.S. and international economic conditions and legal, tax, political and administrative developments, including the effects of energy, trade and environmental policies and existing and future laws and government regulations as well as volatility in the political, legal and regulatory environments as a result of the U.S. presidential election; 
 our ability to comply with federal, state and local regulatory requirements; 
 the impact of repurchases, if any, of securities from time to time; 
 our ability to maintain the health and safety of, as well as recruit and retain, qualified personnel necessary to operate our business; 
 evolving cybersecurity risks such as those involving unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, third-party service provider failures, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access, cyber or phishing attacks, ransomware, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions; 
 our ability to secure or generate sufficient electricity to produce our wells without limitations; and 
 our belief that the outcome of any legal proceedings will not materially affect our financial results and operations. 
 Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, NGL and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify upward or downward revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. 
 These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should therefore be considered in light of various factors, including those set forth under "Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and under "Item 1A. Risk Factors," in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Annual Report") and those set forth from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.

All amounts, dollars and percentages presented in these unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes are rounded and, therefore, approximate. 
 Significant accounting policies 
 There have been no material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As discussed in Note 2 in the 2023 Annual Report, the Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties. This accounting method requires a quarterly full cost ceiling test. The full cost ceiling is based principally on the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, which exclude the effect of the Company's commodity derivative transactions, discounted at . The SEC guidelines require companies to use the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, which are then adjusted for quality, certain transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the delivery point without giving effect to the Company's commodity derivative transactions. These prices are utilized to calculate the estimated future net cash flows in the full cost ceiling calculation. Additional significant inputs included in the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the full cost ceiling calculation include the Company's estimate of operating and development costs, anticipated production of proved reserves and other relevant data. In the event the unamortized cost of evaluated oil and natural gas properties being depleted exceeds the full cost ceiling, as defined by the SEC, the excess is expensed in the period such excess occurs. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible. 
 The unamortized cost of evaluated oil and natural gas properties being depleted did not exceed the full cost ceiling as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. As such, no full cost ceiling impairments were recorded during the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of proved reserves and accounting for oil and natural gas properties in future periods. In addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, changes in oilfield service costs, potential recognition of additional proved undeveloped reserves, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine the Company's actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods. As a result, the Company could incur a material non-cash full cost ceiling impairment in future quarters, which would have an adverse effect on its statement of operations. 
 See Note 2 in the 2023 Annual Report for further discussion of significant accounting policies.

 billion in cash, including closing adjustments (the "Point Acquisition"). The Company agreed to purchase of the acquired assets, consisting of approximately net acres in Ward and Winkler Counties, and will operate the assets, and NOG agreed to purchase the remaining of the assets. The Company's portion of the aggregate preliminary purchase price was million, which consisted of (i) million in cash and (ii) million of estimated transaction-related expenses. The purchase price is subject to additional post-closing adjustments. Based on the relative fair values on the Point Closing Date, the acquired assets and liabilities assumed were allocated as follows: (i) million to evaluated properties, (ii) million to unevaluated properties, (iii) million to revenue suspense liabilities, (iv) million to asset retirement obligation liabilities and (v) million to property tax liabilities. The Point Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets. 
 PEP Acquisition 
 On February 2, 2024 (the "PEP Closing Date"), the Company purchased additional working interests in producing properties associated with the Henry Acquisition (as defined herein), with an effective date of August 1, 2023 (the "PEP Acquisition")

 million consisted of (i) shares of the Company's common stock, par value per share ("Common Stock") based upon the share price as of the PEP Closing Date, (ii) shares of the Company's Cumulative Mandatorily Convertible Series A Preferred Stock, par value per share ("Preferred Stock") based upon the share price as of the PEP Closing Date, (iii) million cash consideration received for closing adjustments and (iv) million in transaction-related expenses, inclusive of post-closing adjustments. The PEP Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets. The shares of Preferred Stock were subsequently converted to an equal number of shares of Common Stock on May 23, 2024. See Note 5 for further discussion of the Preferred Stock conversion. 
 The "Henry Acquisition," which closed on November 5, 2023, consisted of the purchase of certain oil and natural gas properties in the Midland and Delaware basins, and was accounted for as a business combination. See Note 4 in the 2023 Annual Report for additional discussion of the Henry Acquisition and the Company's 2023 asset acquisitions. 
 2023 acquisitions

 Commodity 
 Due to the inherent volatility in oil, NGL and natural gas prices and the sometimes wide pricing differentials between where the Company produces and where the Company sells such commodities, the Company engages in commodity derivative transactions, such as puts, swaps, collars and basis swaps, to hedge price risk associated with a portion of the Company's anticipated sales volumes. By removing a portion of the price volatility associated with future sales volumes, the Company expects to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flows from operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s derivatives were settled based on reported prices on commodity exchanges, with (i) oil derivatives settled based on WTI NYMEX, Argus WTI Midland and Argus WTI Formula Basis pricing, (ii) NGL derivatives settled based on Mont Belvieu OPIS pricing and (iii) natural gas derivatives settled based on Henry Hub NYMEX and Waha Inside FERC pricing.

 Contingent consideration 
 On May 7, 2021, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the "Sixth Street PSA"), to sell of the Company's working interest in certain producing wellbores and the related properties primarily located within Glasscock and Reagan Counties, Texas. The Sixth Street PSA provides for potential contingent payments to be paid to the Company if certain cash flow targets are met related to divested oil and natural gas property operations (the "Sixth Street Contingent Consideration"). The Sixth Street Contingent Consideration provides the Company with the right to receive up to a maximum of million in additional cash consideration, comprised of potential quarterly payments through June 2027 totaling up to million and a potential balloon payment of million in June 2027. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received life-to-date contingent consideration payments of million, with maximum remaining potential cash consideration totaling million. The estimated fair value of the Sixth Street Contingent Consideration was million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023.

 The Company estimates its annual effective tax rate AETR in recording its interim quarterly income tax provision for the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The tax effects of statutory rate changes, significant unusual or infrequently occurring items, and certain changes in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets are excluded from the determination of its estimated AETR and are recognized as discrete items in the quarter in which they occur. The Company's effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively, and is the result of projecting current and deferred U.S. income and Texas Franchise taxes, including the impact of discrete items and permanent differences. Current income tax expense is primarily attributable to Texas Franchise tax. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company determined there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not its federal deferred tax assets are realizable. Therefore, the Company reduced its valuation allowance accordingly and recorded a discrete quarterly benefit of million during the second quarter of 2023. The balance of the valuation allowance reversal was reflected as part of the Company's estimated annualized effective tax rate with respect to prior year projected earnings.

 If the Company were to experience an "ownership change," as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company's ability to offset taxable income, arising after the ownership change with net operating losses and interest expense carryforwards arising prior to the ownership change, could be significantly limited. Based on information available as of September 30, 2024, no such ownership change has occurred. 
 The Company has closed acquisitions during 2024. For income tax purposes, both the PEP Acquisition and the Point Acquisition will be treated as asset purchases.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2023 Annual Report. The following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Please see "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors." Except for purposes of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, references in this Quarterly Report to "Vital Energy," "we," "us," "our" or similar terms refer to Vital Energy and its subsidiaries, collectively, unless the context otherwise indicates or requires. Unless otherwise specified, references to "average sales price" refer to average sales price excluding the effects of our derivative transactions. All amounts, dollars and percentages presented in this Quarterly Report are rounded and therefore approximate. 
 Executive overview 
 We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The oil and liquids-rich Permian Basin is characterized by multiple target horizons, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves, high drilling success rates and high initial production rates. During 2023 and 2024, we added approximately 104,400 net acres through multiple acquisitions. As of September 30, 2024, we had assembled 290,945 net acres in the Permian Basin. 
 Throughout most of the third quarter of 2024, we were operating four drilling rigs and two completions crews, with one additional drilling rig added in connection with the closing of the Point Acquisition on September 20, 2024. We expect to operate five drilling rigs and one to two completions crews during the fourth quarter of 2024. Our planned capital expenditures for full-year 2024 are expected to be between 845.0 million and 870.0 million. However, we will continue to monitor commodity prices and service costs and adjust activity levels in order to proactively manage our cash flows and preserve liquidity. Below is a summary of our financial and operating performance for the third quarter of 2024: 
 Net income of 215.3 million, which includes a non-cash gain on derivatives of 197.5 million 
 Oil, NGL, and natural gas sales of 448.8 million 
 Oil sales volumes of 5,446 MBbl and oil production of 59,198 Bbl/d 
 Oil equivalent sales volumes of 12,267 MBOE and total production of 133,339 BOE/d 
 Capital investments of 241.9 million, excluding non-budgeted acquisition costs 
 Recent developments 
 Point Acquisition 
 On September 20, 2024, we, together with Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. ("NOG"), purchased certain oil and natural gas properties located in the Delaware Basin with an effective date of April 1, 2024 from Point Energy Partners Petroleum, LLC, Point Energy Partners Operating, LLC, Point Energy Partners Water, LLC and Point Energy Partners Royalty, LLC (collectively, Point for an aggregate purchase price of 1.0 billion in cash, including closing adjustments (the "Point Acquisition"). We agreed to purchase 80 of the acquired assets, consisting of approximately 16,300 net acres in Ward and Winkler Counties, and will operate the assets, and NOG agreed to purchase the remaining 20 of the assets. Our portion of the aggregate preliminary purchase price was 833.8 million, which consisted of (i) 816.1 million in cash and (ii) 17.7 million in estimated transaction-related expenses. The purchase price is subject to additional post-closing adjustments, and was funded entirely with borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Upon closing of the Point Acquisition, we entered into the Thirteenth Amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility, which, among other things, increased our aggregate elected commitment to 1.5 billion. See Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the Point Acquisition and our Senior Secured Credit Facility, respectively.

 Commodity prices, reserves and full cost ceiling test 
 Commodity prices 
 Commodity prices have historically been volatile. While general economic concerns continue to place some downward pressure on commodity prices, worldwide commodity demand continues to rise. Although supply has increased, it has been constrained and pricing has been affected, in part, by the impact of the world political and economic environment. Any of the above factors could change or reverse, and global commodity and financial markets remain subject to heightened levels of uncertainty and volatility. 
 With natural gas production in the Permian Basin at all-time highs, transportation capacity to market hubs for our natural gas production provided by existing natural gas pipelines has been generally constrained. During this time of natural gas pipeline capacity constraint, our sales price for natural gas is lower than historical trends and may, at times, be negative. 
 Our results of operations are heavily influenced by oil, NGL and natural gas prices. We maintain an active commodity derivatives program to minimize commodity price volatility and support cash flows for operations. We have entered into a number of commodity derivative contracts that have enabled us to offset a portion of the changes in our cash flow caused by fluctuations in price and basis differentials for our sales of oil, NGL and natural gas, as discussed in "Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." See Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional discussion of our commodity derivatives. Notwithstanding our derivatives strategy, a collapse in commodity prices may affect the economic viability of, and our ability to fund, our drilling and completions programs, as well as the economic recovery of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. 
 Reserves and full cost ceiling test 
 We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties, with the full cost ceiling based principally on the estimated future net cash flows from our proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, which exclude the effect of our commodity derivative transactions, discounted at 10 under required SEC guidelines for pricing methodology. We review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis. In the event the unamortized cost, or net book value, of our evaluated oil and natural gas properties being depleted exceeds the full cost ceiling, the excess is expensed in the period such excess occurs. Once incurred, a write-down of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is not reversible. 
 Our reserves are reported in three product streams: oil, NGL and natural gas. The realized prices, which are utilized to value our proved reserves and calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month prices for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, adjusted for factors affecting price received at the delivery point, as of September 30, 2024 were 79.92 for oil, 14.06 for NGL and 0.81 for natural gas. The unamortized cost of evaluated oil and natural gas properties being depleted did not exceed the full cost ceiling as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. As such, no full cost ceiling impairments were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 If prices remain at or below the current levels, subject to numerous factors and inherent limitations, some of which are discussed below, and all other factors remain constant, we could incur a material non-cash full cost ceiling impairment in future quarters, which would have an adverse effect on our statement of operations. 
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of proved reserves and accounting for oil and natural gas properties in future periods. In addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, changes in oilfield service costs, potential recognition of additional proved undeveloped reserves, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods. Also, purchases of proved properties may be recorded at a cost that exceeds a related increase in the full cost ceiling calculation as acquisitions are generally recorded at fair value based on expected future prices and other factors that may differ from historical prices used in the full cost ceiling test, among other factors. 
 In our upcoming fourth-quarter calculation to value our proved reserves, the October 2023 first-day-of-the-month oil price of 90.79 per Bbl will be replaced by the October 2024 first-day-of-the-month oil price of 69.83 per Bbl. If the October 2024 commodity prices are applied to November 2024 and December 2024 as well, the projected commodity prices for the period beginning January 1, 2024 and ending December 31, 2024 would be 76.71 per Bbl for oil, 13.72 per Bbl for NGL and 0.75 per Mcf for natural gas under SEC guidelines for pricing methodology. Utilizing these prices, with all other factors remaining

 constant with our third-quarter calculation, we would have an implied impairment of our oil and natural gas properties of approximately 325.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Notes 2 and 6 in our 2023 Annual Report for discussion of the full cost method of accounting and our realized prices. 
 Each of the above factors is evaluated on a quarterly basis and if there is a material change in any factor it is incorporated into our reserves estimation utilized in our quarterly accounting estimates. We use our reserve estimates to evaluate, also on a quarterly basis, the reasonableness of our resource development plans for our reported proved reserves. Changes in circumstance, including commodity pricing, economic factors and the other uncertainties described above may lead to changes in our development plans. See "Critical accounting estimates" in "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of the 2023 Annual Report for further discussion of our oil, NGL and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.

 Our average sales price for natural gas for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (0.48) and 0.05, respectively, which were decreases of 133 and 96 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Due to all-time high natural gas production in the Permian Basin, the transportation of our natural gas production to market hubs has been constrained by existing natural gas pipeline capacity. Such pipeline constraints have resulted in low and, at times, negative sales prices for natural gas during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following tables present net settlements received (paid) for matured commodity derivatives utilized in our calculation of the average sales prices, with commodity derivatives, for the periods presented and the corresponding changes for such periods:

 Sales of purchased oil are a function of the volumes and prices of purchased oil sold to customers. We are a firm shipper on the Gray Oak pipeline and we may elect to utilize purchased oil to fulfill portions of our commitments. The continuance of this practice in the future is based upon, among other factors, our pipeline capacity as a firm shipper and the quantity of our lease production which may contribute to our pipeline commitments. During the first and second quarters of 2024, we had no sales of purchased oil due to fulfilling our Gray Oak pipeline commitments with our lease production. During the third quarter of 2024, we utilized purchased oil to fulfill portions of our commitments. We expect to continue fulfilling our Gray Oak pipeline commitments primarily with our lease production in the foreseeable future.

 (1) Selected average costs and expenses per BOE sold are based on actual amounts and may not recalculate using the rounded numbers presented in the table above. 
 Lease operating expenses ("LOE"). LOE are daily expenses incurred to bring oil, NGL and natural gas out of the ground and to market, together with the daily expenses incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include maintenance, repairs and non-routine workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties. LOE increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to our acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties in 2023 and the PEP Acquisition in first quarter of 2024. Workover expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 19.4 million and 55.4 million, respectively, which were increases of 65 and 120 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Production and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes remained relatively flat and increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to increased oil and NGL sales revenues. Production taxes are based on and fluctuate in proportion to our oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues, and are established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Ad valorem taxes are based on and fluctuate in proportion to the taxable value assessed by the various counties where our oil and natural gas properties are located. 
 Oil transportation and marketing expenses. These are expenses incurred for the delivery of produced oil to customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast market via the Gray Oak pipeline. We ship the majority of our produced oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast, which we

 believe provides a long-term pricing advantage versus the Midland market. Firm transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity associated with transportation agreements are also included in oil transportation and marketing expenses. Oil transportation and marketing expenses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. This is primarily due to increases in transportation expenses of 1.6 million and 6.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as our oil production has increased, and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in firm transportation payments on excess capacity of 4.0 million, compared to the same periods in 2023. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional discussion of our transportation commitments. 
 Gas gathering, processing and transportation expenses. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we became party to certain natural gas processing agreements where the Company concluded it is the principal in the transaction and the customer is the ultimate third party, with control of the NGL or residue gas transferring at the tailgate of the midstream entity's processing plant. Revenue for such agreements is recognized on a gross basis, with gathering, processing and transportation fees presented as an expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Costs of purchased oil. Costs of purchased oil are a function of the volumes and prices of purchased oil. We are a firm shipper on the Gray Oak pipeline, and in the event our long-haul transportation capacity on the Gray Oak pipeline exceeds our net production, we may purchase third-party oil at the trading hubs to satisfy the deficit in our associated long-haul transportation commitments. During the first and second quarters of 2024, we had no costs of purchased oil due to fulfilling our Gray Oak pipeline commitments with our lease production. During the third quarter of 2024, we utilized purchased oil to fulfill portions of our commitments. We expect to continue fulfilling our Gray Oak pipeline commitments primarily with our lease production in the foreseeable future. 
 General and administrative " G A " (excluding LTIP and transaction expenses). G A, excluding employee compensation expenses from our long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") and transaction expenses associated with the Henry Acquisition and certain financing transactions, decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher performance-related bonuses accrued for our workforce in 2023 as compared to the same period in 2024. G A, excluding LTIP and transaction expenses, increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to workforce and professional expenses in connection with the growth of the Company, offset by the aforementioned changes during third-quarter 2024. 
 General and administrative (LTIP cash). LTIP cash expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to (i) fluctuations in the fair value of our cash-settled LTIP awards as a result of the performance of our stock and (ii) cash performance awards and employee cash retainer awards expensed through 2023, which vested during first-quarter 2024. 
 General and administrative (LTIP non-cash). LTIP non-cash expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to 2024 expense including restricted stock awards for a larger population of our workforce as compared to 2023. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for information regarding our equity-based compensation. 
 General and administrative (transaction expenses). Transaction expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent incurred costs associated with the Henry Acquisition. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the Henry Acquisition.

Table of Content 

 Depletion expense per BOE increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to an increase in future development costs and volumes of our proved reserves as a result of our recent acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties in 2023 and 2024. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report and " Commodity prices, reserves and full cost ceiling test" for additional information regarding the full cost method of accounting.

 Non-cash gain (loss) on derivatives, net is the result of new and matured contracts, including contingent consideration derivatives for the period subsequent to the initial valuation date and through the end of the contingency period, and the changing relationship between our outstanding contract prices and the future market prices in the forward curves, which we use to calculate the fair value of our derivatives. In general, if outstanding commodity contracts are held constant, we experience gains during periods of decreasing market prices and losses during periods of increasing market prices. Settlements paid or received for matured derivatives are for our (i) commodity derivative contracts, which are based on the settlement prices compared to the prices specified in the derivative contracts and (ii) contingent consideration derivatives. 
 See Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information regarding our derivatives. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense remained relatively flat and increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We reflect interest paid to the lenders and bondholders in interest expense, net of

 amounts capitalized. In addition, we include the amortization of (i) debt issuance costs, which includes origination, amendment and professional fees, (ii) commitment fees and (iii) annual agency fees in interest expense. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to new senior unsecured notes issued during the third quarter of 2023 and the first half of 2024. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our long-term debt. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 66.1 million. During the first quarter of 2024, we settled a cash tender offer on the January 2028 Notes. During the second quarter of 2024, we settled a cash tender offer on the September 2030 Notes and redeemed the remaining principal amount outstanding on the January 2028 Notes. The related loss on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of early tender and redemption premiums and write-offs of debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our long-term debt. 
 Income tax benefit (expense) 
 We are subject to federal and state income taxes and the Texas Franchise tax. Income tax expense was recorded during the first nine months of 2024 due to the application of our estimated annual effective tax rate to the book net income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 21.89 and 22.83 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Our effective tax rate was not meaningful for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to releasing our full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during the second-quarter 2023. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate as a result of the impact of discrete items, state income taxes and permanent differences. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of our income taxes. 
 We have significant federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards. If we were to experience an ownership change, as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses and interest expense carryforwards arising prior to the ownership change may be significantly limited. Based on information available as of September 30, 2024, no such ownership change has occurred. 
 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, proceeds from equity offerings, proceeds from senior unsecured and subordinated note offerings, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and proceeds from asset dispositions. Our primary operational uses of capital have been for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and infrastructure development. 
 We continually seek to maintain a financial profile that provides operational flexibility and monitor the markets to consider which financing alternatives, including debt and equity capital resources, joint ventures and asset sales, are available to meet our future planned capital expenditures, a significant portion of which we are able to adjust and manage. We also continually evaluate opportunities with respect to our capital structure, including issuances of new securities, as well as transactions involving our outstanding senior notes, which could take the form of open market or private repurchases, exchange or tender offers, or other similar transactions, and our common stock, which could take the form of open market or private repurchases. We may make changes to our capital structure from time to time, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency. Such financing alternatives, or combination of alternatives, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. We continually look for other opportunities to maximize stockholder value. For further discussion of our financing activities related to debt instruments, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Due to the inherent volatility in the prices of oil, NGL and natural gas and the sometimes wide pricing differentials between where we produce and where we sell such commodities, we engage in commodity derivative transactions to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our anticipated sales volumes. By removing a portion of the price volatility associated with future sales volumes, we expect to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flows from operations. See "Part I. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" below. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for discussion of our open commodity positions.

Table of Content 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 22.2 million and available capacity under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of 640.0 million, resulting in total liquidity of 662.2 million. As of November 5, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility of 950.0 million, resulting in available capacity of 550.0 million. We believe that our operating cash flows and the aforementioned liquidity sources provide us with sufficient liquidity and financial resources to manage our cash needs and contractual obligations, to implement our currently planned capital expenditure budget and, at our discretion, to fund any share repurchases, pay down, repurchase or refinance debt or adjust our planned capital expenditure budget. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional discussion of additional borrowings and repayments on the Senior Secured Credit Facility subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 Cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations 
 The following table presents significant cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of September 30, 2024:

 (1) Amounts presented include both principal and interest obligations. 
 (2) Amounts presented include both minimum lease payments and imputed interest. 
 We expect to satisfy our short-term contractual and other obligations with cash flows from operations. See Notes 4 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and Notes 2, 5 and 18 in our 2023 Annual Report for further discussion of our known contractual and other obligations. 
 Cash flows 
 The following table presents our cash flows for the periods presented and the corresponding changes for such periods: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change ) Change ) Net cash provided by operating activities 743,156 579,222 163,934 28 Net cash used in investing activities (1,480,169) (1,001,442) (478,727) (48) Net cash provided by financing activities 745,144 967,480 (222,336) (23) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 8,131 545,260 (537,129) (99) 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Notable cash changes include an increase in total oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues of 319.6 million, partially offset by an increase of 153.2 million in lease operating expenses. For additional information on changes in revenues and expenses, see " Results of operations." 
 Our operating cash flows are sensitive to a number of variables, the most significant of which are the volatility of oil, NGL and natural gas prices, mitigated to the extent of our commodity derivatives' exposure, and sales volume levels. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather, infrastructure, transportation capacity to reach markets, costs of operations, legislation and regulations, including potential government production curtailments, and other variable factors significantly impact the prices of these commodities. For additional information on risks related to our business, see "Part I. Item 3.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and "Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to (i) our acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties in 2024 and (ii) an increase in capital expenditures as a result of increased drilling and completions activity. For further discussion of our acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 We currently expect capital investments for 2024 to be in the approximate range of 845.0 million to 870.0 million. We will continue to monitor commodity prices and service costs and adjust activity levels in order to proactively manage our cash flows and preserve liquidity. We do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. 
 The following tables present the components of our capital investments, excluding non-budgeted acquisition costs, for the periods presented and the corresponding changes for such periods: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change ) Change ) Oil and natural gas properties (1) 
 652,604 483,329 169,275 35 Midstream and other fixed assets (1)

 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Includes capitalized share-settled equity-based compensation and asset retirement costs. 
 The amount, timing and allocation of capital investments are largely discretionary and within management's control. If oil, NGL and natural gas prices are below our acceptable levels, or costs are above our acceptable levels, we may choose to defer a portion of our capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity and prioritize capital projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and potential to generate near-term cash flow. Subject to financing alternatives, we may also increase our capital expenditures significantly to take advantage of opportunities we consider to be attractive. We continually monitor and may adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to world developments, as well as success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, availability of financing and joint venture opportunities, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals, the availability of rigs and supplies, changes in service costs, contractual obligations, internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 745.1 million compared to 967.5 million in 2023. Notable 2024 activity includes (i) borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility of 1.4 billion, which is inclusive of borrowings utilized to fund the Point Acquisition, (ii) proceeds from the issuance of certain senior unsecured notes of 1.0 billion, (iii) extinguishment of certain senior unsecured notes of 952.2 million, (iv) payments on our Senior Secured Credit Facility of 715.0 million and (v) payments for debt issuance costs of 21.7 million. For further discussion of our financing activities related to debt instruments, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Senior Secured Credit Facility, which matures on September 13, 2027, had a maximum credit amount of 3.0 billion, a borrowing base and an aggregate elected commitment of 1.5 billion, with 860.0 million outstanding, and was subject to an interest rate of 8.093 . The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains both financial and non-financial covenants, all of which we were in compliance with for all periods presented. Additionally, the Senior Secured Credit Facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, limited to the lesser of total capacity or 80.0 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

Table of Content 

 See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further discussion of our Senior Secured Credit Facility. 
 Supplemental Guarantor information 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.6 billion of our senior unsecured notes remained outstanding. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vital Midstream Services, LLC (the "Guarantor"), jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guarantees all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes. 
 The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantor and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future senior indebtedness of such Guarantor, and senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor. The guarantees of the senior unsecured notes by the Guarantor are subject to certain Releases. The obligations of the Guarantor under its note guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent such note guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. Further, the rights of holders of the senior unsecured notes against the Guarantor may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Vital Energy is not restricted from making investments in the Guarantor and the Guarantor is not restricted from making intercompany distributions to Vital Energy. 
 The assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuer and the Guarantor are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Accordingly, we have omitted the summarized financial information of the issuer and the Guarantor that would otherwise be required. 
 Critical accounting estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 There have been no changes to our identified critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See our critical accounting estimates in "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our 2023 Annual Report. See "Commodity prices, reserves and full cost ceiling test" for additional discussion our full cost ceiling calculation.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. The term "market risk," in our case, refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, NGL and natural gas prices and in interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk-sensitive derivative instruments were entered into for hedging purposes, rather than for speculative trading. 
 Commodity price exposure 
 Due to the inherent volatility in oil, NGL and natural gas prices and the sometimes wide pricing differentials between where we produce and where we sell such commodities, we engage in commodity derivative transactions, such as puts, swaps, collars and basis swaps, to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our anticipated sales volumes. By removing a portion of the price volatility associated with future sales volumes, we expect to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flows from operations. 
 The fair values of our open commodity positions are largely determined by the relevant forward commodity price curves of the indexes associated with our open derivative positions. The following table provides a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect on income or loss before income taxes of a hypothetical 10 change in the relevant forward commodity price curves of the indexes associated with our open commodity positions as of September 30, 2024: 
 (in thousands) As of September 30, 2024 Commodity derivative asset position 199,242 Impact of a 10 increase in forward commodity prices (175,092) Impact of a 10 decrease in forward commodity prices 171,169 
 See Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further discussion of our commodity derivatives. For additional discussion of our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see "Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Interest rate risk 
 Our Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate and our senior unsecured notes bear interest at fixed rates. The interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 was 8.093 . See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further discussion of our debt. The interest rate on borrowings may be based on an alternate base rate or term secured overnight financing rate ("Term SOFR"), at our option. Interest on alternate base rate loans is equal to the sum of (a) the highest of (i) the "prime rate" (as publicly announced by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.) in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5 and (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in our Senior Secured Credit Facility) for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 1 and (b) the applicable margin. Interest on Term SOFR loans is equal to the sum of (a)(i) the Term SOFR (as defined in our Senior Secured Credit Facility) rate for such period plus (ii) the Term SOFR Adjustment (as defined in our Senior Secured Credit Facility) of 0.1 (in the case of clause (a), subject to a floor of 0 plus (b) the applicable margin. The applicable margin varies from 1.25 to 2.25 on alternate base rate borrowings and from 2.25 to 3.25 on Term SOFR borrowings, in each case, depending on our utilization ratio. At September 30, 2024, the applicable margin on our borrowings were 1.75 for alternate base rate borrowings and 2.75 for Term SOFR borrowings.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Vital Energy's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), was performed under the supervision and with the participation of Vital Energy's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on that evaluation, these officers concluded that Vital Energy's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and other procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Vital Energy's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Evaluation of changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Citations and orders may be appealed with the potential of reduced or dismissed penalties. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) are outlined below.

 (a) The definition of mine under section 3 of the Mine Act includes the mine, as well as other items used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work of extracting minerals, such as land, structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools and minerals preparation facilities. Unless otherwise indicated, any of these other items associated with a single mine have been aggregated in the totals for that mine. MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities such as preparation facilities. We are providing the information in the table by mine rather than MSHA identification number because that is how we manage and operate our mining business and we believe this presentation will be more useful to investors than providing information based on MSHA identification numbers. 
 (b) Represents the total dollar value of the proposed assessment from MSHA under the Mine Act pursuant to the citations and or orders preceding such dollar value in the corresponding row.
