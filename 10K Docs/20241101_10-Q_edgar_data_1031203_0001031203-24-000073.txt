 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, as well as our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading operator in the automotive retail industry. Through our omni-channel platform, we sell new and used cars and light trucks, arrange related vehicle financing, sell service and insurance contracts, provide automotive maintenance and repair services and sell vehicle parts. We operate in geographically diverse markets that extend across 17 states in the U.S. a nd 73 towns and cities in the U.K. A s of September 30, 2024, our retail network consisted of 146 dealerships in the U.S. and 113 dealerships in the U.K. 
 Recent Events 
 On October 25, 2024, the U.K. Court of Appeal ruled in favor of claimants in a case involving undisclosed commissions paid by lenders to car dealerships. The court found that brokers must disclose commission details to customers, and failure to do so indicated that customers did not give informed consent to these transactions. This ruling could require lenders and dealerships to repay these commissions. In response to the court ruling and regulatory actions in the U.K., certain lenders have already implemented and others are likely to implement new or different commission models and require additional disclosures to customers. The final outcome of the court ruling, including an expected appeal, is uncertain but could materially impact our U.K. operations if we are required to refund past commissions or change our current commission models. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to automotive and other laws and regulations, which, if we are found to have violated, may adversely affect our business and results of operations for additional information. 
 On August 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Inchcape Retail automotive operations in the U.K. The Inchcape Acquisition, comprised of 54 dealership locations, certain real estate and three collision centers, substantially increased our portfolio acro ss the U.K. Refer to Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our acquisition of Inchcape Retail. 
 On June 19, 2024, we were informed of a cybersecurity incident experienced by CDK Global LLC CDK ), which resulted in service outages on CDK s dealers systems (the CDK Incident ). CDK provides clients in the automotive industry, including Group 1 dealerships in the U.S., with a software as a service platform SaaS platform used by dealerships in managing customer relationships, sales, financing, service, inventory and back-office operations. The CDK Incident temporarily disrupted our business applications and processes in our U.S. operations that rely on CDK s dealers systems. Despite the CDK Incident, all Group 1 U.S. dealerships continued to conduct business using alternative processes until CDK s dealers systems were available. On June 26, 2024, CDK restored service to us for the core DMS, at which time, subject to certain modified procedures, we resumed processing transactions through the CDK DMS. We do not expect the CDK Incident to have a material impact on our overall financial condition or on our ongoing results of operations. 
 On March 20, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA finalized new emissions standards for light and medium-duty vehicles, including passenger cars, vans, pickups, sedans and sport utility vehicles for model years 2027 through 2032 and beyond. The final rule sets new, strict standards intended to reduce air pollutant emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions; however, the new standards are now subject to legal challenge. The EPA projects the final rule will accelerate the transition to, and availability of, clean vehicle technologies, including hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Although the future impact of these regulations on our operations cannot be predicted with certainty, the regulations may have a significant impact on the future mix and demand for vehicles provided by our manufacturers. We will continue to monitor the impact of the final regulations on our manufacturers and dealership operations. 
 The global economy experienced elevated levels of inflation beginning in 2022. In response to higher than historical average inflationary pressures and challenging macroeconomic conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Federal Reserve ), along with other central banks, including in the U.K., maintained interest rates at elevated levels throughout 2023. In 2024, inflation began to return to historical norms. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 Current Quarter ), the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England lowered their interest rates by 50 and 25 basis points, respectively, in an effort to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment. 
 Although the Federal Reserve and Bank of England decreased interest rates and inflationary pressures moderated during 2024, existing elevated prices as a result of previous rates of inflation above historical levels continue to reduce the disposable income of our customers. In addition, volatility in new vehicle availability and higher interest rates over historical average rates have increased the monthly cost of financing vehicles as compared to prior periods. These factors have contributed to a continued decline in used vehicle prices during the Current Quarter as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 Prior Year Quarter ).

 Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 
 For discussion of our critical accounting policies and accounting estimates, refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or accounting estimates since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The same store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships and corporate headquarters for the identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first full month in which we owned the dealership. Amounts related to divestitures are excluded from each comparative period, ending with the last full month in which we owned the dealership. Same store results provide a measurement of our ability to grow revenues and profitability of our existing stores and also provide a metric for peer group comparisons. For these reasons, same store results allow management to accurately manage and monitor the underlying performance of the business and is also useful to investors. 
 We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposure is to the GBP. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our underlying business and results of operations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our current period reported results for entities reporting in currencies other than USD using comparative period exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. The constant currency performance measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, we caution investors not to place undue reliance on non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Our management also uses constant currency and adjusted cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures to assess our business, including communication with our Board of Directors, investors and industry analysts concerning financial performance. We disclose these non-GAAP measures and the related reconciliations because we believe investors use these metrics in evaluating longer-term period-over-period performance. These metrics also allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess operating performance. 
 Certain amounts in the financial statements may not compute due to rounding. All computations have been calculated using unrounded amounts for all periods presented. 
 Retail new vehicle units sold include new vehicle agency units sold under agency arrangements with certain manufacturers in the U.K. The agency units and related revenues are excluded from the calculation of the average sales price per unit sold for new vehicles due to their net presentation within revenues as only the sales commission is reported in revenues for dealerships operating under an agency arrangement. The agency units and related net revenues are included in the calculation of gross profit per unit sold.

 Revenues 
 Total revenues in the U.S. during the Current Quarter increased 71.5 million, or 1.8 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, driven by the acquisition of stores, partially offset by slightly lower same store revenues. 
 Total same store revenues in the U.S. during the Current Quarter decreased 70.6 million, or 1.9 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. This decrease was driven by lower revenues from used vehicle retail, new vehicle retail and F I, partially offset by higher parts and service revenues. 
 New vehicle retail same store revenues slightly underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, driven by lower pricing, partially offset by more units sold. Manufacturer vehicle deliveries increased in the Current Quarter and as a result, our inventory levels were higher than the Prior Year Quarter, providing for the increase in units sold. Higher new vehicle supply compared to the Prior Year Quarter created downward pressure on pricing and margins. We ended the Current Quarter with a U.S. new vehicle inventory supply of 56 days, 26 days higher than the Prior Year Quarter. 
 Used vehicle retail same store revenues underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by fewer units sold, coupled with lower used vehicle retail pricing. Used vehicle supply improved as a result of higher new vehicle supply. However, lingering impacts from above-historical average inflation over the past two years reducing the disposable income of our customers and higher interest rates compared to historical averages increasing the monthly cost of financing vehicles, continued to create downward pressure on pricing and demand. 
 Parts and service same store revenues outperformed the Prior Year Quarter, driven by increases in warranty and customer pay revenues, partially offset by decreases in collision and wholesale revenues. This outperformance reflects increased business activity and increased same store technician headcount through our technician recruiting and retention efforts, providing greater capacity to meet increased demand. 
 F I same store revenues slightly underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by fewer same store used vehicle units sold, partially offset by higher same store F I gross profit per unit sold. Penetration rates for vehicle service contracts, new vehicle finance and other F I products improved, contributing to the higher same store F I gross profit per unit sold. OEM incentives have increased in the Current Quarter, leading to the improved new vehicle F I penetration. 
 Gross Profit 
 Total gross profit in the U.S. during the Current Quarter decreased 4.6 million, or 0.7 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, driven by lower same store gross profit, partially offset by the acquisition of stores. 
 Total same store gross profit in the U.S. during the Current Quarter decreased 26.7 million, or 4.0 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by lower gross profit from new vehicle retail, used vehicle retail and F I, partially offset by higher parts and service. 
 New vehicle retail same store gross profit underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, driven by a decrease in same store gross profit per unit sold, partially offset by a slight increase in same store units sold. The decrease in same store gross profit per unit is due to higher deliveries from our OEMs and increasing inventory levels of new vehicles as described above. 
 Used vehicle retail same store gross profit underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in same store gross profit per unit sold, coupled with fewer same store units sold, as described above for used vehicle retail same store revenues. Our used vehicle wholesale same store gross profit outperformed the Prior Year Quarter, driven by an increase in same store gross profit per unit sold, coupled with an increase in same store units sold. 
 Parts and service same store gross profit outperformed the Prior Year Quarter, as described above for parts and service same store revenues. 
 F I same store gross profit, slightly underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, as described above for F I same store revenues. 
 Total same store gross margin in the U.S. decreased 39 basis points, primarily driven by an underperformance in new vehicle retail for the reasons described above for same store gross profit for new vehicle retail. This underperformance was partially offset by an outperformance in used vehicle wholesale as described above in same store used vehicle gross profit. 
 SG A Expenses 
 SG A as a percentage of gross profit increased 455 basis points and increased 387 basis points on an as reported and same store basis, respectively, compared to the Prior Year Quarter.

The agency units and related net revenues are included in the calculation of gross profit per unit sold. The GBP to USD foreign currency exchange rate has fluctuated from 1 to 1.221 at September 30, 2023 , to 1 to 1.339 at September 30, 2024 , or an increase in the value of the GBP of 9.7 . 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues in the U.K. during the Current Quarter increased 444.8 million, or 55.2 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by the acquisition of stores and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Total same store revenues in the U.K. during the Current Quarter slightly decreased 13.4 million, or 1.7 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by an underperformance in used vehicle sales, partially offset by outperformances in new vehicle sales, parts and service and the benefit of positive foreign currency exchange rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues decreased 4.6 , primarily driven by underperformances across all revenue streams except parts and service. 
 New vehicle retail same store revenues, on a constant currency basis, were relatively consistent with the Prior Year Quarter. We ended the Current Quarter with a U.K. new vehicle inventory supply of 23 days, one day higher than the Prior Year Quarter. 
 Used vehicle retail same store revenues, on a constant currency basis, underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by lower used vehicle retail pricing on a constant currency basis and fewer units sold. 
 Used vehicle wholesale same store revenues, on a constant currency basis, underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in units sold. 
 Parts and service same store revenues, on a constant currency basis, outperformed the Prior Year Quarter, driven by i ncreases in customer pay, warranty and wholesale revenues, reflecting increased business activity. W e have invested in improvements to our U.K. customer contact center, streamlining operations to make scheduling appointments easier for customers, resulting in an increase in parts and service activity driving an increase in revenues as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. 
 F I same store revenues, on a constant currency basis, underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in the number of contracts sold. 
 Gross Profit 
 Total gross profit in the U.K. during the Current Quarter increased 71.0 million, or 68.6 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. 
 Total same store gross profit in the U.K. during the Current Quarter decreased 0.2 million, or 0.2 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. On a constant currency basis, total same store gross profit decreased 3.2 , driven by downward pressure on same store new vehicle and used vehicle gross profit, partially offset by higher same store parts and service gross profit. 
 New vehicle retail same store gross profit, on a constant currency basis, underperformed the Prior Year, primarily due to a decrease in new vehicle retail gross profit per unit sold, partially offset by an increase units sold, as a result of the increase in new vehicle production since the Prior Year Quarter, generating downward pressure on new vehicle margins. 
 Used vehicle retail same store gross profit, on a constant currency basis, underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, driven by a decrease in used vehicle retail same store gross profit per unit sold and fewer units sold. 
 Parts and service same store gross profit, on a constant currency basis, outperformed the Prior Year Quarter, driven by increases in parts and service same store revenues, as discussed above in parts and service same store revenues. 
 F I same store gross profit, on a constant currency basis, underperformed the Prior Year Quarter, as described above in F I same store revenues. 
 Total same store gross margin in the U.K. increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by a slight improvement in used vehicle wholesale margins.

 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the Current Quarter and Current Year was higher compared to the Prior Year Quarter and Prior Year, primarily driven by acquired property and equipment in our U.S. and U.K. regions, as we continue to strategically add dealership related real estate and facilities to our investment portfolio and make improvements to our existing facilities intended to enhance the profitability of our dealerships and improve the overall customer experience. 
 
 Floorplan Interest Expense 
 Our floorplan interest expense fluctuates with changes in our outstanding borrowings and associated interest rates, which are based on SOFR, the U.S. prime rate or other benchmark rates. Outstanding borrowings largely fluctuate based on our levels of new and used vehicle inventory. To mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations, we employ an interest rate hedging strategy, whereby we swap variable interest rate exposure on a portion of our borrowings for a fixed interest rate. 
 Total floorplan interest expense during the Current Quarter, increased 14.6 million, or 88.7 , as compared to the Prior Year Qua rter. For the Current Year, floorplan interest expense increased 31.6 million, or 70.6 , as compared to the Prior Year. The increase in floorplan interest expense during the Current Quarter and Current Year was driven primarily by an increase in inventories added to our floorplan due to improvements in manufacturer production as well as acquisitions, partially offset by realized gains on our interest rate swap portfolio due to increases in corresponding interest rates. 
 Refer to Note 6. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of interest rate swaps.

 Other Interest Expense, Net 
 Other interest expense, net consists of interest charges primarily on our 750.0 million 4.00 Senior Notes due August 2028 4.00 Senior Notes ), 500.0 million 6.375 Senior Notes due January 2030 6.375 Senior Notes ), real estate related debt and other debt, partially offset by interest income. 
 Other interest expense, net during the Current Quarter, increased 13.3 million, or 50.1 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. For the Current Year, other interest expense, net, increased 30.4 million, or 42.1 , as compared to the Prior Year. The increase in other interest expense, net during the Current Quarter and Current Year was primarily attributable to increased borrowings on the Acquisition Line, the issuance of the 6.375 Senior Notes during the Current Quarter, additional real estate related debt in our U.S. and U.K. regions and higher interest rates on existing borrowings. Additionally, the difference in the Current Year was partly due to a decrease in the gain recognized on the de-designation of mortgage interest rate swaps as compared to the Prior Year of approximately 3.8 million . Refer to Note 8. Debt within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our debt. Refer to Note 6. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the de-designation of the mortgage interest rate swap. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes of 42.5 million during the Current Quarter decreased by 13.9 million, or 24.7 , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. For the Current Year, our provision for income taxes of 133.5 million decreased by 28.1 million or 17.4 , as compared to the Prior Year. The tax expense decrease in the Current Quarter and Current Year, as compared to the Prior Year Quarter and Prior Year, was primarily due to lower pre-tax book income. Our Current Year effective tax rate of 24.9 , remained consistent with the Prior Year effective tax rate of 24.7 . 
 We believe that it is more-likely-than-not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances provided, will be realized, based primarily on assumptions of our future taxable income, considering future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are primarily derived from cash on hand, cash temporarily invested as a pay down of our U.S. Floorplan Line and FMCC Facility levels (refer to Note 9. Floorplan Notes Payable within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, working capital, dealership and real estate acquisition financing and proceeds from debt and equity offerings. We anticipate we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, coupled with cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt and meet any other recurring operating expenditures. 
 Available Liquidity Resources 
 We had the following sources of liquidity available (in millions): September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 58.7 Floorplan offset accounts 99.8 Available capacity under Acquisition Line 654.6 Total liquidity 813.1 
 Cash Flows 
 We arrange our new and used vehicle inventory floorplan financing through lenders affiliated with our vehicle manufacturers and our Revolving Credit Facility. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we report floorplan financed with lenders affiliated with our vehicle manufacturers (excluding the cash flows from or to manufacturer-affiliated lenders participating in our syndicated lending group) within Cash Flows from Operating Activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We report floorplan financed with the Revolving Credit Facility (including the cash flows from or to manufacturer-affiliated lenders participating in the facility) and other credit facilities in the U.K. unaffiliated with our manufacturer partners, within Cash Flows from Financing Activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 9. Floorplan Notes Payable within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our Revolving Credit Facility.

 However, we believe that all floorplan financing of inventory purchases in the normal course of business should correspond with the related inventory activity and be classified as an operating activity. As a result, we use the non-GAAP measure Adjusted net cash provided by/used in operating activities and Adjusted net cash provided by/used in financing activities to further evaluate our cash flows. We believe that this classification eliminates excess volatility in our operating cash flows prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, floorplan financing associated with dealership acquisitions and dispositions are classified as investing activities on an adjusted basis to eliminate excess volatility in our operating cash flows prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Sources and Uses of Liquidity from Operating Activities Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023 
 For the Current Year, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 18.8 million, as compared to the Prior Year. On an adjusted basis for the same period, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 99.4 million. The decrease on an adjusted basis was primarily driven by an 89.5 million decrease in net income, a 56.1 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a 21.9 million decrease in floorplan notes payable manufacturer affiliates, partially offset by an 87.5 million decrease in contracts-in-transit and vehicle receivables. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity from Investing Activities Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023 
 For the Current Year, net cash used in investing activities increased by 863.5 million, as compared to the Prior Year. On an adjusted basis for the same period, adjusted net cash used in investing activities increased by 865.9 million, primarily due to a 903.5 million increase in acquisition activity, a 32.1 million increase in escrow payments for acquisitions and a 15.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, including real estate, partially offset by a 76.8 million increase in proceeds from disposition of franchises and property and equipment. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditures include costs to extend the useful lives of current dealership facilities, as well as to start or expand operations. In general, expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities are driven by dealership acquisition activity, new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer, significant growth in sales at an existing facility, relocation opportunities or manufacturer imaging programs. We critically evaluate all planned future capital spending, working closely with our manufacturer partners to maximize the return on our investments. 
 For the Current Year , 152.6 million was used to purchase property and equipment.

 For the Current Year, net cash provided by financing activities increased by 882.7 million, as compared to the Prior Year. On an adjusted basis for the same period, adjusted net cash provided by financing activities increased by 965.7 million. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities on an adjusted basis was primarily driven by the issuance of 500.0 million of 6.375 Senior Notes, a 419.0 million increase in net borrowings of other debt, including real estate-related debt and increases in net borrowings on our U.S. Floorplan line of 232.5 million (representing the net cash activity in our floorplan offset account). These increases were partially offset by a 179.5 million increase in net repayments on the Acquisition Line. 
 
 Credit Facilities, Debt Instruments and Other Financing Arrangements 
 Our various credit facilities, debt instruments and other financing arrangements are used to finance the purchase of inventory and real estate, provide acquisition funding and provide working capital for general corporate purposes. 
 The following table summarizes the commitment of our credit facilities as of September 30, 2024 (in millions): Total Commitment Outstanding Available U.S. Floorplan Line (1) 
 1,500.0 1,203.2 296.8 Acquisition Line (2) 
 1,000.0 179.4 654.6 Total revolving credit facility 2,500.0 1,382.6 951.4 FMCC Facility (3) 
 300.0 162.1 137.9 GM Financial Facility (4) 
 348.1 239.1 109.0 Total U.S. credit facilities (5) 
 3,148.1 1,783.8 1,198.3 
 (1) The available balance at September 30, 2024, includ es 99.8 million of immediately available funds. The remaining available balance can be used for vehicle inventory financing. 
 (2) The outstanding balance of 179.4 million is related to outstanding letters of credit of 12.2 million and 167.2 million in borrowings. The borrowings outstanding under the Acquisition Line included 75.0 million USD borrowings and 70.0 million of GBP borrowings translated at the spot rate on the day borrowed, solely for purposes of calculating the outstanding and available borrowings under the Acquisition Line in accordance with the Revolving Credit Facility. The available borrowings may be limited from time to time, based on certain debt covenant calculations, and as a result, the outstanding balance plus available borrowings may not equal the total commitment. 
 (3) The available balance at September 30, 2024, includes no immediately available funds. The remaining available balance can be used for Ford new vehicle inventory financing. 
 (4) The remaining available balance as of September 30, 2024, can be used for General Motors new and rental vehicle inventory financing. 
 (5) The outstanding balance excludes 665.0 million of borrowings with manufacturer-affiliates and third-party financial institutions for foreign and rental vehicle financing not associated with any of our U.S. credit facilities. 
 We have other credit facilities in the U.S. and the U.K. with third-party financial institutions, most of which are affiliated with the automobile manufacturers that provide financing for portions of our new, used and rental vehicle inventories. In addition, we have outstanding debt instruments, including our 4.00 and 6.375 Senior Notes, as well as real estate related and other debt instruments. Refer to Note 8. Debt within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 Covenants 
 Our Revolving Credit Facility, indentures governing our 4.00 and 6.375 Senior Notes and certain mortgage term loans contain customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens or to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and to merge or consolidate with other entities. Certain of our mortgage agreements contain cross-default provisions that, in the event of a default of certain mortgage agreements and of our Revolving Credit Facility, could trigger an uncured default. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the requirements of the financial covenants under our debt agreements. We are required to maintain the ratios detailed in the following table: As of September 30, 2024 Required Actual Total adjusted leverage ratio 1.20 3.57

 Based on our position as of September 30, 2024, and our outlook as discussed within Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and do not anticipate any material liquidity constraints or issues with our ability to remain in compliance with our debt covenants. 
 Refer to Note 8. Debt and Note 9. Floorplan Notes Payable within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our debt instruments, credit facilities and other financing arrangements existing as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a certain monetary limit. On May 9, 2024, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to 250.0 million. For the Current Year, 438,165 s hares were repurchased, at an average price o f 295.80 per share, for a total of 129.6 million, excluding excise taxes o f 1.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 174.8 million available under our current share repurchase authorization. 
 During the Current Quarter, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.47 per share on all shares of our common stock, which resulted in 6.2 million paid to common shareholders and 0.1 million to unvested restricted stock award holders. 
 Future share repurchases and the payment of any future dividends are subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors, taking into consideration our historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, covenant compliance, changes in laws and regulations, current economic environment and other factors considered relevant. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We address interest rate risks primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. We do not currently hedge foreign currency exchange risk, as discussed further below. The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided regarding our foreign currency exchange rates and financial instruments to which we are a party at September 30, 2024, and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 
 Interest Rates 
 We have interest rate risk on our variable-rate debt obligations. Based on variable-rate borrowings outstanding of 3.2 billion and 2.1 billion during the Current Year and Prior Year, respectively, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 22.8 million and a 11.9 million change to our annual interest expense, respectively, after consideration of the average interest rate swaps in effect during the periods. 
 To mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations, we employ an interest rate hedging strategy, whereby we swap variable interest rate exposure on a portion of our borrowings for a fixed interest rate. In addition, our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to our variable-rate floorplan borrowings is partially mitigated by manufacturers interest assistance, which in some cases is influenced by changes in market-based variable interest rates. We reflect interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle inventory cost until the associated vehicle is sold. During the Current Year and Prior Year, we recognized 63.4 million and 51.9 million , respectively, of interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 The functional currency of our U.K. subsidiaries is the GBP. Our exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates relates to the effects of translating financial statements of those subsidiaries into our reporting currency, which we do not hedge against based on our investment strategy in these foreign operations. A 10 devaluation in average foreign currency exchange rates for GBP to USD would have resulted in a 259.1 million and 213.8 million decrease to our revenues for the Current Year and Prior Year, respectively.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that objectives of the control system are met. There are inherent limitations in all control systems, including the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of one or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and while our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not party to any legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits that, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For a discussion of our legal proceedings, refer to Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies within our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except as set forth below, during the Current Year, there were no changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We rely on third-party vendors and suppliers for key components of our business. 
 Many components of our business, including data management, key operational processes and critical customer systems, are provided by or licensed from various third-party vendors and suppliers. In addition, we also rely on third-party vendors to supply key products and services to us and our customers. One or more of these third-party vendors or suppliers may experience financial distress, technology challenges, cybersecurity incidents, staffing shortages or liquidity challenges, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer other disruptions in their business, each of which could affect their ability to serve us and our customers. If any of our vendors or suppliers fail to deliver their products or services for any reason, our business and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. 
 A failure of any of our information systems or those of our third-party service providers or a cybersecurity incident, including loss or unauthorized access of confidential information or personally identifiable information PII about our customers or employees, could negatively affect our business, operations and financial condition. 
 We depend on the efficient operation of our information systems and those of our third-party service providers and rely on information systems at our dealerships in all aspects of our sales and service efforts, as well as in the preparation of our consolidated financial and operating data. All of our dealerships currently operate on two DMSs, one DMS for the U.S and one DMS for the U.K. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we receive significant PII about our customers and our employees. Such PII is primarily collected at our dealerships and through our Acceleride platform via an online DMS. A security incident to obtain such information could be caused by malicious insiders and third parties using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses, including hacking, malware, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception. Although companies across all industries are affected by malicious efforts to obtain access to PII, the automotive dealership industry has been a particular target of identity thieves. The techniques used by cyber attackers change frequently and may be difficult to detect. We have implemented security measures that are designed to detect and protect against cyberattacks. 
 Despite these measures and any additional measures we may implement or adopt in the future, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, have been and are vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, malware, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, scams, ransomware, burglary, human errors, acts of vandalism, misdirected wire transfers or other events. If an unauthorized party is successful in obtaining trade secrets, PII, confidential, or otherwise protected information of our dealerships or our customers or in disrupting our operations through a cyberattack, the attack could result in loss of revenue, increase the costs of doing business, harm our competitiveness, reputation or customer or vendor relationships, satisfaction or loyalty. In addition, security breaches and other security incidents could expose us to a risk of loss or exposure of this information, which could result in potential liability, investigations, regulatory fines, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, costs related to remediation or the payment of ransom, and litigation including individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, and civil or criminal investigations or actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Likewise, our business could be significantly disrupted if (i) the DMS fails to integrate with other third-party information systems, customer relations management tools or other software, or to the extent that any of these systems become unavailable to us or fail to perform as designed for an extended period of time or (ii) our relationship with our DMS providers or any other third-party provider deteriorates.

 Despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from compromise, we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems and third-party vendors. For example, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we were informed of a cybersecurity incident experienced by CDK, which resulted in service outages on CDK s dealers systems. CDK provides clients in the automotive industry, including our dealerships in the U.S., with a SaaS platform used by dealerships in managing customer relationships, sales, financing, service, inventory and back-office operations. In response to the CDK Incident, we immediately activated our cyber incident response procedures and proactively took measures to protect and isolate our systems from CDK s platform. All of our U.S. dealerships continued to conduct business using alternative processes until CDK s dealers systems were fully back online. We also do not believe that the CDK Incident resulted in a breach of any PII about our customers or employees. Our dealerships in the U.K. do not use CDK s dealers systems and were therefore not impacted by the CDK service outage. As a consequence, while we do not expect the CDK Incident to have a material impact on our overall financial condition or on its ongoing results of operations, if we, or any of our third-party services providers were to experience a material cybersecurity event, our business and results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. 
 We are subject to automotive and other laws and regulations, which, if we are found to have violated, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 A number of laws and regulations applicable to automotive companies affect our business and conduct, including, but not limited to, our sales, operations, financing, insurance, advertising and employment practices. Other rules such as franchise laws and regulations, consumer protection laws and other extensive laws and regulations apply to new and used motor vehicle dealers. Additionally, in every jurisdiction in which we operate, we must obtain various permits and licenses in order to conduct our business. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory remedial obligations or the limitations on certain aspects of our operations. 
 In the U.K., the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA regulates financial services firms and financial markets, including our activities in acting as broker for the financing of vehicle sales. In January 2024, the FCA announced that it planned to undertake a formal review into the historic use of discretionary commission arrangements DCAs amid concerns that the practice of linking brokers commissions to the interest rate charged to customers may have been unfair to customers, resulting in customers paying too much for their car loans. 
 Additionally in the U.K., on October 25, 2024, the U.K. Court of Appeal issued a judgment in the three joined appeals for Johnson v Firstrand Bank Ltd, Wrench v Firstrand Bank Ltd and Hopcraft v Close Brothers Ltd (collectively, the COA litigation ), finding that the claimants in those cases are entitled to be paid a sum equivalent to the undisclosed commission paid by their lenders to the dealerships from which they acquired their cars plus interest. Underlying the Court s judgment were the findings that, among other things, brokers owe fiduciary and/or disinterested duties to customers, which, among other things, require disclosure to the customer of the rate and amount of the commission paid and the basis for its calculation. As a result, the failure to provide such full commission disclosure effectively results in the failure to obtain a customer s fully informed consent to the payment of commission. The judgment also appears to extend beyond DCAs to address all commission disclosures generally. Finally, the U.K. Court of Appeal held where there is a failure to disclose, lenders and dealerships who acted as brokers are jointly and severally liable for the repayment of the commission. 
 The final outcomes of the FCA s DCA review and the COA litigation, including an anticipated appeal thereof to The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, are uncertain. Any judicial outcome or regulatory redress scheme, which ultimately results in a wider legal or regulatory requirement to refund historical commissions paid to us, could materially and adversely affect our U.K. operations.
