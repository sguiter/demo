 Long-Lived Asset Impairment During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge totaling million related to the Active Sports Restructuring, of which million related to intangible assets, and million related to other long-lived asset categories. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had indicators of impairment of the long-lived assets for certain locations, which were unrelated to the Active Sports Restructuring. Such indicators primarily included decreases in market rental rates or market value of real property for closed locations, or based on the Company s review of location performance in the normal course of business. As a result of updating certain assumptions in the long-lived asset impairment analysis for these locations, the Company determined that the fair value of certain long-lived assets were below their carrying value and were impaired. The long-lived asset impairment charges were calculated as the amount that the carrying value of these locations exceeded the estimated fair value, except that individual assets cannot be impaired below their individual fair values when that fair value can be determined without undue cost and effort. Estimated fair value is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows, while property appraisals or market rent analyses are utilized for determining the fair value of certain assets related to properties and leases.

 Liabilities related to assets held for sale: Current portion of long-term debt Long-term debt, net of current portion Additionally, on May 3, 2024, the Company closed on the sale of certain assets of the RV and Outdoor Retail segment s RV furniture business CWDS and, in connection with the sale, entered into a supply agreement Supplier Agreement with the buyer and the sublease of certain properties and equipment to the buyer. The approximately million fair value of consideration received from the divestiture were comprised of approximately million of cash consideration, million of an intangible asset for the Supplier Agreement, and million of cash consideration as a holdback to be released by the buyer after less any offset for expenditures that were indemnified by the Company. The divested net assets of CWDS were comprised primarily of approximately million of products, parts, accessories and other inventories, million of net intangible assets, million of accounts payable assumed and million of goodwill allocated from the RV and Outdoor Retail segment based on the relative fair value of CWDS.

(2) The million current and million non-current portions of acquisition-related contingent consideration were included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Derived Participation Investment The Company has entered into an arrangement with a consumer financing partner to invest in a participation interest in the cash flows of certain financing transactions under the white label financing program with such consumer financing partner. The fair value of this investment was estimated by discounting the projected cash flows subject to the participation interest. The assumptions in the analysis included loan losses, prepayments, and recoveries derived based on historical observation of such data pertaining to the RV industry, as well as other relevant industries with loan structure similar to that of the RV industry. This is categorized as a Level 3 measurement and there was no significant change in fair value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Contingent Consideration The Company s contingent consideration liability was established as part of the consideration for the acquisition of a tire rescue roadside assistance business in June 2024. The fair value of this liability was estimated as the present value of the probability weighted milestone payments at each of the first two anniversaries of the date of the acquisition for a maximum aggregate payment of million if all milestones are reached. The assumptions in the analysis included the Company s assessment of the probability that the milestones will be reached and a discount rate based primarily on the Company s credit risk and its ability to pay. This is categorized as a Level 3 measurement and there was no significant change in fair value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other Fair Value Disclosures There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels and there were no material re-measurements to fair value during 2024 and 2023 of assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For floor plan notes payable under the Floor Plan Facility, the amounts reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets approximate the fair value due to their short-term nature or the existence of variable interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates.

For purposes of this Form 10-Q, we define an "Active Customer" as a customer who has transacted with us in any of the eight most recently completed fiscal quarters prior to the date of measurement. Unless otherwise indicated, the date of measurement is September 30, 2024, our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Overview Camping World Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries) is the world s largest retailer of RVs and related products and services. Through our Camping World and Good Sam brands, our vision is to build a business that makes RVing and other outdoor adventures fun and easy. We strive to build long-term value for our customers, employees, and stockholders by combining a unique and comprehensive assortment of RV products and services with a national network of RV dealerships, service centers and customer support centers along with the industry s most extensive online presence and a highly-trained and knowledgeable team of associates serving our customers, the RV lifestyle, and the communities in which we operate. We also believe that our Good Sam organization and family of highly specialized services and plans, including roadside assistance, protection plans and insurance, uniquely enables us to connect with our customers as stewards of an outdoor and recreational lifestyle. On September 30, 2024, we operated a total of 207 locations, with all of them selling and/or servicing RVs. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. A summary of the changes in quantities and types of retail stores and changes in same stores from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, are in the table below:

 Strategic Review As disclosed in our Annual Report, on January 17, 2024, we announced that we were reviewing potential strategic alternatives for our Good Sam business. In conducting that review, we came to the decision that the greatest value can be achieved through retaining the Good Sam business. We have deepened our appreciation for the non-cyclical nature of the business and also recognize the large growth potential of the business over multiple vectors in the outdoor and recreational space. Going forward, Good Sam will continue to benefit from its relationship with the Camping World brand and store footprint, but will be empowered to operate independently to drive growth. With over 50 years of experience, Good Sam has built a range of asset-light services, with high levels of recurring revenue and attractive gross margins. Good Sam offers programs, plans and services that are geared towards protecting, insuring and promoting the outdoor and recreational lifestyle, and include services such as extended vehicle service contracts, vehicle roadside assistance, property and casualty insurance, travel protection, travel planning and directories, and publications. We believe this highly specialized product offering has significant potential to penetrate broader parts of the recreational market, including other powersports such as boating or ATVs, to further empower our customers joy of travel, recreation and the outdoors. Industry Trends According to the RV Industry Association s RVIA survey of manufacturers, which almost entirely focuses on North America, wholesale shipments of new RVs for 2023 were 313,174 units, 36.5 less than in 2022. The September 2024 issue of RV RoadSigns , the quarterly forecast prepared by ITR Economics for the RVIA, projected RV wholesale shipments to be approximately 324,000 in 2024, or 3.5 higher than 2023, and approximately 346,000 in 2025, or 6.8 higher than forecasted 2024. RV wholesale shipments for the first nine months of 2024 were 256,412 units, up 7.7 compared to the same timeframe last year per the September 2024 survey of manufacturers prepared by the RVIA. The per unit cost of new vehicles in fiscal year 2022 and 2023 had been significantly higher than we experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the RV manufacturers supply constraints during the pandemic, strong demand for new vehicles during the pandemic, higher inflation, and higher interest rates. These higher costs had been partially mitigated by the higher average selling prices on new vehicles initially, but we experienced a decrease in new vehicle gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2022, which continued in 2023, as a result of these higher costs. We experienced a 4.3 decrease in the average sale price of new vehicles during fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022, driven by more price sensitive customers in a higher interest rate environment. Since certain of our RV manufacturers had indicated that they expected new towable vehicle average manufacturer selling prices to decline by up to 10 for 2024 model year vehicles, we focused on clearing out a significant portion of our pre-2024 model year new vehicles primarily during the fourth quarter of 2023 and early 2024 to improve the mix of our new vehicle inventory toward the lower cost 2024 model year vehicles. These new vehicle cost decreases further decreased average selling prices of new vehicles in 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, overall new vehicle gross margins decreased 162 basis points to 13.5 , as our average selling price per vehicle decreased 7.4 while our average cost per vehicle decreased 5.6 . Additionally, these new vehicle price pressures have resulted, and may continue to result, in a decline in residual values of used vehicles, which led us to discount used vehicle pricing in order to maintain used vehicles as a lower cost alternative to new vehicles, which has negatively impacted used vehicle gross margins. We have also experienced lower used vehicle inventory levels in 2024 as we slowed procurement to allow RV owner pricing expectations to adjust as a result of 2024 model year pricing declines.

 Financial Institutions The Company maintains the majority of its cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at certain of these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Inflation As noted in Industry Trends above, we have experienced reduced cost and average selling prices with respect to new vehicles and, as a byproduct of the new vehicle pricing decrease, used vehicles. New and used vehicles regularly represent a majority of our costs. However, inflationary factors, such as increases to our other product and overhead costs, may adversely affect our operating results if the selling prices of our products and services do not increase proportionately with those increased costs or if demand for our products and services declines as a result of price increases to address inflationary costs. Additionally, our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and utilities, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Further, the cost of remodeling acquired RV dealership locations and constructing new RV dealership locations is subject to inflationary increases in the costs of labor and material, which results in higher rent expense on new RV dealership locations. Finally, our credit agreements include interest rates that vary based on various benchmarks. Such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation. Restructuring In 2019, we made a strategic decision to refocus our business around our core RV competencies (the 2019 Strategic Shift ), which was substantially complete by December 31, 2021. On March 1, 2023, our management determined to implement plans (the Active Sports Restructuring to exit and restructure operations of our indirect subsidiary, Active Sports, LLC, a specialty products retail business Active Sports ), which was substantially complete by December 31, 2023. For the 2019 Strategic Shift, the remaining potential ongoing charges related to lease termination costs and other associated costs relating to the leases of certain previously closed locations and facilities. The timing of sublease and/or termination negotiations will vary as both are contingent on landlord approvals. We expect that the ongoing lease-related costs relating to the 2019 Strategic Shift, net of associated sublease income, will be less than 3.5 million per year. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company terminated the final significant lease under the Active Sports Restructuring that included a 1.5 million lease termination fee that was paid on October 1, 2024. The Company does not expect any further costs under the Active Sports Restructuring beyond insignificant lease costs of less than 0.2 million per year. See Note 4 Restructuring and Long-Lived Asset Impairment to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Comparison of Certain Trends to Pre-COVID-19 Pandemic Periods New vehicle gross margins in the third quarter of 2024 were within the range of gross margins for the pre-COVID-19 pandemic periods presented in the table below. Additionally, used vehicle gross margins were negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2024 from the discounting necessary to maintain used vehicles as a lower cost alternative for our customers. Beginning primarily in the fourth quarter of 2023, we adjusted our acceptable procurement cost of used vehicles to reflect the lower average market price of RVs that was driven by the lower cost 2024 models.

 Our Corporate Structure Impact on Income Taxes Our corporate structure is commonly referred to as an Up-C structure and typically results in a different relationship between income before income taxes and income tax expense than would be experienced by most public companies with a more traditional corporate structure. More traditional structures are typically comprised predominately of Subchapter C corporations C-Corps and/or lacking significant non-controlling interests with holdings through limited liability companies or partnerships. Typically, most of our income tax expense is recorded at the CWH level, our public holding company, based on its allocation of taxable income from CWGS, LLC. More specifically, CWH is organized as a C-Corp and, as of September 30, 2024, is a 53.1 owner of CWGS, LLC. CWGS, LLC is organized as a limited liability company and treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes and, as such is generally not subject to any U.S. federal entity-level income taxes Pass-Through ), with the exception of Americas Road and Travel Club, Inc. and FreedomRoads RV, Inc., and their wholly-owned subsidiaries, which are C-Corps embedded within the CWGS, LLC structure. CWH receives an allocation of its share of the net income of CWGS, LLC based on CWH s weighted-average ownership of CWGS, LLC for the period. CWH recognizes income tax expense on its pre-tax income including its portion of this income allocation from CWGS, LLC primarily relating to Pass-Through entities. The income tax relating to the net income of CWGS, LLC allocated to CWH that relates to separately taxed C-Corp entities is recorded within the consolidated results of CWGS, LLC. No income tax expense is recognized by the Company for the portion of net income of CWGS, LLC allocated to non-controlling interest other than income tax expense recorded by CWGS, LLC. Rather, tax distributions are paid to the non-controlling interest holders which are recorded as distributions to holders of LLC common units in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. CWH is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of CWGS, LLC and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company used blended statutory tax rate assumptions of 25.0 and 25.1 , respectively, for income adjustments applicable to CWH when calculating the adjusted net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. basic and diluted (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q). CWGS, LLC may be liable for various other state and local taxes.

 Revenue and Gross Profit Good Sam Services and Plans Good Sam Services and Plans revenue increased primarily from increased underwriting profit sharing from extended vehicle warranty programs, partially offset by reduced contracts in force for the extended vehicle warranty programs, and increased contracts in force for our Good Sam Insurance Agency programs. Good Sam Services and Plans gross profit and margin decreased primarily due to a nonrecurring 5.5 million exit arrangement with a service partner in 2023, and incremental roadside assistance claims costs in 2024, partially offset by increased underwriting profit sharing and reduced marketing costs. RV and Outdoor Retail New vehicles New vehicles revenue increased primarily due to a 31.2 increase in new vehicles sold, partially offset by a 7.4 decrease in the average selling price per new vehicle sold driven primarily by the lower cost 2024 model year travel trailers and discounting of pre-2024 model year new vehicles. On a same store basis, new vehicles revenue increased 19.2 to 737.1 million from an increase in new vehicles sold of 28.8 , which was partially offset by a 7.4 decrease in the average selling price per new vehicle sold. New vehicles gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in new vehicles sold, partially offset by the lower gross profit per new vehicle. The lower gross profit per new vehicle and 162 basis point decrease in new vehicle gross margin was driven by the 7.4 decrease in the average selling price per new vehicle sold, partially offset by the 5.6 decrease in average cost per new vehicle sold, which was primarily from the lower cost 2024 model year travel trailers. Used vehicles Used vehicles revenue decreased primarily due to both a 17.9 reduction in used vehicles sold and a 7.7 decrease in the average selling price per used vehicle sold. The decrease in used vehicles sold was due in large part to slowed procurement of used vehicles. This reduced availability and decrease in average selling price of used vehicles was largely a byproduct of the lower cost and selling price of 2024 model year new vehicles, which impacted used vehicles as discussed in Industry Trends above. On a same store basis, used vehicles revenue decreased 27.6 to 399.5 million from a decrease in used vehicles sold of 20.5 and a 8.9 decrease in average sales price per used vehicle sold. Used vehicles gross profit decreased primarily due to the decrease in used vehicles sold and the lower gross profit per used vehicle. The lower gross profit per used vehicle and 76 basis point decrease in used

 vehicle gross margin was driven by the 7.7 decrease in average selling price per used vehicle sold, partially offset by the 6.9 decrease in average cost per used vehicle sold. Products, service and other Products, service and other revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in sales activity resulting from the divestiture of our RV furniture business and fewer used vehicles sold leading to a decline in retail product attachment to vehicle sales. On a same store basis, products, service and other revenue decreased 2.3 to 182.2 million. Products, service and other gross profit increased primarily due to higher labor billing rates and a higher proportion of billable labor. The increase in products, service and other gross margin was primarily due to higher labor billing rates on warranty service, a higher proportion of billable labor, the divestiture of our RV furniture business, and improvements to the pricing for aftermarket accessories. Finance and insurance, net Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit is recorded net, since the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction, and commission is recognized when a finance and insurance product contract payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Finance and insurance, net revenue increased 2.6 million, which was primarily a result of an increased number of contracts sold resulting from increased vehicles sold and an increase in revenue per contract. Finance and insurance, net revenue as a percentage of new and used vehicle revenue was 13.1 , an increase from 12.9 . On a same store basis, finance and insurance, net revenue decreased 1.8 . Good Sam Club Good Sam Club revenue and gross profit decreased slightly primarily from the 12.1 decrease in Good Sam Club members, excluding free basic plan members, partially offset by an increased rate per annual membership and higher Good Sam co-branded credit card royalty fees. The 335 basis point increase in Good Sam Club gross margins was primarily from the increased rate per annual membership. The decrease in Good Sam Club members resulted from an increase in the standard membership price and the introduction of the free basic plan in late 2023 that provides for limited participation in the loyalty point program without access to the remaining member benefits. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to continue to see declines in the Good Sam Club members as a result of this price increase and the availability of the free basic plan. Operating Expenses and Other Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to 5.4 million of reduced employee compensation costs, 1.3 million of reduced nonbillable RV service work, and 1.0 million of reduced rent expense, partially offset by 3.3 million of additional advertising expenses and 3.0 million of increased expenses from other outside service providers, such as professional fees, consultants, and software service providers. Long-lived asset impairment As discussed in Note 4 Restructuring and Long-Lived Asset Impairment to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, we recognized 1.9 million of long-lived asset impairments, an increase of 0.2 million. These long-lived asset impairments related to closed or underperforming store locations, which included the evaluation of decreases in market rental rates or market value of real property for closed store locations.

 Floor plan interest expense The increase in floor plan interest expense was primarily due to a higher average floor plan notes payable balance and, to a lesser extent, a 46 basis point increase in the average floor plan borrowing rate. The average interest rate for the Floor Plan Facility for 2024 and 2023 was 7.82 and 7.36 , respectively. Other interest expense, net Other interest expense, net increased primarily due to a higher average principal balance from the revolving line of credit under the Floor Plan Facility (see Note 7 Long-Term Debt and Note 3 Inventories and Floor Plan Payables to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). The average interest rate for the Term Loan Facility for 2024 and 2023 was 7.92 and 7.87 , respectively. The average interest rate on the M T Real Estate Facility for 2024 and 2023 was 7.93 and 7.83 , respectively. Tax Receivable Agreement Liability adjustment The Tax Receivable Agreement Liability adjustment in 2023 consisted of a benefit of 1.7 million related to a remeasurement from a decrease in blended state income tax rates. Income tax expense The reduction of income tax expense to an income tax benefit was primarily due to lower income generated from CWGS, LLC for which the Company is subject to U.S. federal and state taxes on its allocable share.

 Good Sam Services and Plans Good Sam Services and Plans revenue increased primarily from increased underwriting profit sharing from extended vehicle warranty programs, partially offset by reduced contracts in force for the extended vehicle warranty programs, and increased contracts in force for our Good Sam Insurance Agency programs. Good Sam Services and Plans segment income margin decreased to 45.0 from 65.3 . This segment income margin decrease and the decrease in Good Sam Services and Plans segment income was primarily due to a 5.5 million prior year exit arrangement with a service partner, incremental roadside assistance claims costs in 2024, and increased general and administrative expenses, resulting from increased employee compensation expenses, partially offset by increased underwriting profit sharing for the extended vehicle warranty programs, and reduced marketing costs. RV and Outdoor Retail RV and Outdoor Retail segment revenue decreased primarily due to a 143.3 million, or 24.2 , decrease in used vehicles revenue, and a 10.8 million, or 4.6 , decrease in products, service and other revenue, partially offset by a 146.1 million, or 21.5 , increase in new vehicles revenue, and a 2.5 million, or 1.5 , increase in finance and insurance, net revenue. RV and Outdoor Retail segment income decreased primarily due to decreased segment gross profit of 16.0 million primarily relating to reduced volume and average sales price of used vehicles sold; a 2.6 million increase in floor plan interest expense; and a 0.2 million increase in long-lived asset impairment; partially offset by a 3.3 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (see discussion of selling, general and administrative expenses above for the similar drivers of this change), a 3.0 million reduction in lease termination expense, and a 0.1 million decrease in loss on sale or disposal of assets. RV and Outdoor Retail segment income margin decreased 72 basis points to 2.6 , which was primarily due a lower volume of used vehicles sold and a lower average price per vehicle sold.

 Revenue and Gross Profit Good Sam Services and Plans Good Sam Services and Plans revenue increased primarily due to increased contracts in force for our Good Sam Insurance Agency programs. Good Sam Services and Plans gross profit and gross margin decreased primarily due to a nonrecurring 5.5 million exit arrangement with a service partner in 2023 and incremental roadside assistance claims costs in 2024, partially offset by increased contracts in force for our Good Sam Insurance Agency Programs, increased extended vehicle warranty underwriter profit sharing, and reduced marketing expenses. RV and Outdoor Retail New vehicles New vehicles revenue increased primarily due to a 22.7 increase in new vehicles sold, partially offset by a 10.8 decrease in the average selling price per new vehicle sold driven primarily by the lower cost 2024 model year travel trailers and discounting of pre-2024 model year new vehicles. On a same store basis, new vehicles revenue increased 4.4 to 2.1 billion with an increase in new vehicles sold of 17.3 , which was partially offset by an 11.0 decrease in the average selling price per new vehicle sold. New vehicles gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in new vehicles sold, partially offset by the lower gross profit per new vehicle. The lower gross profit per new vehicle and 58 basis point decrease in new vehicle gross margin was driven by the 10.8 decrease in average selling price per new vehicle sold, which was mostly offset by the 10.2 decrease in average cost per new vehicle sold, which was primarily from the lower cost 2024 model year travel trailers. Used vehicles Used vehicles revenue decreased primarily due to a 14.5 reduction in used vehicles sold and a 10.7 decrease in the average selling price per used vehicle sold. The decrease in used vehicles sold was due in large part to slowed procurement of used vehicles. This reduced availability and decrease in average selling price of used vehicles were largely a byproduct of the lower cost and selling price of 2024 model year new vehicles, which impacted used vehicles as discussed in Industry Trends above. On a same store basis, used vehicles revenue decreased 27.8 to 1.1 billion from a decrease in used vehicles sold of 18.5 and an 11.5 decrease in average sales price per used vehicle sold. Used vehicles gross profit decreased primarily due to the decrease in used vehicles sold and the lower gross profit per used vehicle. The lower gross profit per used vehicle and 324 basis point decrease in used vehicle gross margin was driven by the 10.7 decrease in average selling price per used vehicle sold, partially offset by the 7.0 decrease in average cost per used vehicle sold. Products, service and other Products, service and other revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in sales activity resulting from our Active Sports Restructuring, the divestiture of our RV furniture business, and fewer used vehicles sold

 leading to a decline in retail product attachment to vehicle sales, partially offset by increases in RV service revenue. On a same store basis, products, service and other revenue decreased 6.0 to 504.1 million. Products, service and other gross profit increased primarily due to higher labor billing rates and a higher proportion of billable labor. The increase in products, service and other gross margin was primarily due to higher labor billing rates resulting from increased demand and increased technician wages, a higher proportion of billable labor, product discounting associated with restructuring of our Active Sports business in 2023, and margin improvement associated with the sale of our furniture business in the second quarter of 2024. Finance and insurance, net Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit is recorded net, since the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction, and commission is recognized when a finance and insurance product contract payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Finance and insurance, net revenue increased 20.4 million, which was primarily a result of an increased number of contracts sold from the increased vehicles sold. Finance and insurance, net revenue as a percentage of new and used vehicle revenue was 13.4 , an increase from 12.2 . On a same store basis, finance and insurance, net revenue decreased slightly by 0.7 . Good Sam Club Good Sam Club revenue and gross profit decreased slightly from a 12.1 decrease in Good Sam Club members, excluding free basic plan members, partially offset by an increased rate per annual membership and higher Good Sam branded credit card fees. The decrease in Good Sam Club members resulted from an increase in the standard membership price and the introduction of the free basic plan in late 2023 that provides for limited participation in the loyalty point program without access to the remaining member benefits. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to continue to see declines in the Good Sam Club members as a result of this price increase and the availability of the free basic plan. Operating Expenses and Other Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to 23.1 million of additional advertising expenses and 5.2 million of increased outside professional services, partially offset by reduced employee compensation costs of 18.9 million, which included a decrease in equity-based compensation expense of 1.9 million, and a 5.5 million reduction in nonbillable RV service work expense. Long-lived asset impairment As discussed in Note 4 Restructuring and Long-Lived Asset Impairment to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, we recognized 12.4 million of long-lived asset impairments, an increase of 3.1 million. These long-lived asset impairments generally related to closed or underperforming store locations, which included the evaluation of decreases in market rental rates or market value of real property for closed store locations. However, 6.6 million of the 2023 long-lived asset impairment related to the Active Sports Restructuring. Loss (gain) on sale or disposal of assets The increased loss on sale or disposal of assets in 2024 was driven primarily by the divestiture of our RV furniture business that resulted in a loss of 7.1 million (see Note 5 Assets Held for Sale and Business 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 Divestiture to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). Additionally, the gain on sale or disposal of assets in 2023 related primarily to the sale of properties. Floor plan interest expense The increase in floor plan interest expense was primarily due to an 88 basis point increase in the average floor plan borrowing rate, and an increase in the average floor plan notes payable balance. The average interest rate for the Floor Plan Facility for 2024 and 2023 was 7.78 and 6.90 , respectively. Other interest expense, net Other interest expense, net increased primarily due to an increase in the Term Loan Facility average interest rate and a higher average principal balance from additional borrowings on the Company s Real Estate Facilities and the revolving line of credit under the Floor Plan Facility (see Note 7 Long-Term Debt and Note 3 Inventories and Floor Plan Payables to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). The average interest rate for the Term Loan Facility for 2024 and 2023 was 7.96 and 7.48 , respectively. The average interest rate on the M T Real Estate Facility for 2024 and 2023 was 7.55 and 6.94 , respectively. Tax Receivable Agreement Liability adjustment The Tax Receivable Agreement Liability adjustment in 2023 consisted of a benefit of 1.7 million related to a remeasurement from a decrease in blended state income tax rates. Income tax expense The reduction of income tax expense to an income tax benefit was primarily due to losses generated from CWGS, LLC for which the Company is subject to U.S. federal and state taxes on its allocable share.

 Good Sam Services and Plans Good Sam Services and Plans revenue increased primarily due to increased contracts in force for our Good Sam Insurance Agency programs. Good Sam Services and Plans segment income decreased primarily due to a 5.5 million prior year exit arrangement with a service partner, incremental roadside assistance claims costs in 2024, and increased general and administrative expenses primarily related to increased wages and bank charges, partially offset by increased contracts in force for our Good Sam Insurance Agency Programs, extended vehicle warranty underwriter profit sharing, and reduced marketing expenses. Segment income margin decreased 747 basis points to 48.7 primarily due to the prior year exit arrangement with a service partner, incremental roadside assistance claims costs, and additional general and administrative expenses. RV and Outdoor Retail RV and Outdoor Retail segment revenue decreased primarily due to a 392.9 million, or 23.6 , decrease in used vehicles revenue, a 52.5 million, or 7.6 , decrease in products, service and other revenue, and a 0.5 million, or 1.6 , decrease in Good Sam Club revenue, partially offset by a 202.2 million, or 9.5 , increase in new vehicles revenue, and a 20.1 million, or 4.3 , increase in finance and insurance, net revenue. RV and Outdoor Retail segment income decreased primarily due to decreased segment gross profit of 80.6 million primarily relating to reduced volume and average sales price of used vehicles sold; a 16.8 million increase in floor plan interest expense; a 14.5 million increase in loss on sale or disposal of assets; and a 3.1 million increase in long-lived asset impairment; partially offset by a 3.0 million reduction in lease termination expense and a 1.8 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (see discussion of selling, general and administrative expenses above for the similar drivers of this change). RV and Outdoor Retail segment income margin decreased 213 basis points to 1.8 , which was primarily due a lower volume of used vehicles sold and a lower average price per vehicle sold, in addition to a 14.5 million increase in loss on sale or disposal of assets. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA Margin; Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. Basic; Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. Diluted; Adjusted Earnings Per Share Basic; Adjusted Earnings Per Share Diluted; and Selling, General, and Administrative Expense SG A Excluding Equity-based Compensation (collectively the Non-GAAP Financial Measures ). We believe that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics we use in our financial and operational decision making. Certain of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company s industry and are used by management to evaluate our operating performance, to evaluate the effectiveness of strategic initiatives, and for planning purposes. By providing these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, together with reconciliations, we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. In addition, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities use Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated for our subsidiary CWGS Group, LLC, to measure our compliance with covenants such as the consolidated leverage ratio. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. They should not be construed as an inference that the Company s future results will be unaffected by any items adjusted for in these Non-GAAP Financial Measures. In evaluating these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, it is reasonable to expect that certain of these items will occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and

Table of Contents 
 operating results of other companies over time. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this section and in the reconciliation tables below help management with a measure of our core operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations. For periods beginning after December 31, 2022 for the 2019 Strategic Shift and for periods beginning after December 31, 2023 for the Active Sports Restructuring, we are no longer including the other associated costs category of expenses relating to those restructuring activities as restructuring costs for purposes of our Non-GAAP Financial Measures, since these costs are not expected to be significant in future periods. For a discussion of restructuring activities, see Note 4 Restructuring and Long-Lived Asset Impairment to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we use are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before other interest expense, net (excluding floor plan interest expense), provision for income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of certain noncash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, long-lived asset impairment, lease termination, gains and losses on sale or disposal of assets, net, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, restructuring costs, losses and gains and impairment on investments in equity securities, and other unusual or one-time items. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the same manner. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these Non-GAAP Financial Measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. The following table reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measures:

 Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. and Adjusted Earnings Per Share We define Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. Basic as net income (loss) attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, long-lived asset impairment, lease termination, gains and losses on sale or disposal of assets, net, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, restructuring costs, loss (gain) and impairment on investments in equity securities, other unusual or one-time items, the income tax (expense) benefit effect of these adjustments, and the effect of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from these adjustments. We define Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. Diluted as Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. Basic adjusted for the reallocation of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests from stock options and restricted stock units, if dilutive, or the assumed redemption, if dilutive, of all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC for shares of newly-issued Class A common stock of Camping World Holdings, Inc.

(n) Represents the per share impact of stock options, restricted stock units, and/or common units of CWGS, LLC from the difference in their dilutive impact between the GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. 
 SG A Excluding Equity-based Compensation We define SG A Excluding Equity-based Compensation as SG A before Equity-based Compensation relating to SG A. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of SG A Excluding Equity-based Compensation may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate SG A Excluding Equity-based Compensation in the same manner. We present SG A Excluding Equity-based Compensation because we believe that investors understanding of our performance and drivers of our other Non-GAAP Financial Measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, is enhanced by including this Non-GAAP Financial Measure as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.

These cash requirements have historically been met through cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from registered offerings of our Class A common stock, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), borrowings under our Floor Plan Facility (as defined in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), and borrowings under our Real Estate Facilities (as defined in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). Our additional liquidity needs are expected to include public company costs, payment of cash dividends, any exercise of the redemption right by the Continuing Equity Owners from time to time (should we elect to redeem common units for a cash payment), our stock repurchase program as described below, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and state and federal taxes to the extent not reduced as a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Continuing Equity Owners may exercise such redemption right for as long as their common units remain outstanding. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary, we expect that the payments that we will be required to make to the Continuing Equity Owners, Former Profits Unit Holders and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. will be significant. Any payments made by us to Continuing Equity Owners, Former Profits Unit Holders and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to CWGS, LLC and, to the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For a discussion of the Tax Receivable Agreement, see Note 13 Income Taxes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Stock Repurchase Program During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, 120.2 million was available under the stock repurchase program to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock. Dividends We announced on August 1, 2023, that the Board of Directors approved a decrease of the quarterly cash dividend to 0.125 per share of Class A common stock from 0.625 per share, beginning with the quarterly cash dividend to be paid in September 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we paid our quarterly cash dividend of 0.125 per share of Class A common stock for an aggregate 5.7 million. This dividend was funded entirely from the Excess Tax Distribution (as defined under Dividend Policy included in Part II, Item 5 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 of our Annual Report), with no portion funded by common unit cash distributions from CWGS, LLC. We believe that this decrease in the quarterly cash dividend will help us continue to execute our expansion plans through accretive RV dealership acquisitions. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, restrictions under applicable law, the extent to which such distributions would render CWGS, LLC insolvent, our business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations particularly with respect to liquidity, and we may not pay future dividends according to our policy, or at all. See Dividend Policy included in Part II, Item 5 of our Annual Report and Risk Factors Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock Our ability to pay regular and special dividends on our Class A common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our structure and statutory restrictions included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report. Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the RV and Outdoor Retail segment purchased real property for an aggregate purchase price of 1.2 million. Over the next twelve months, our expansion of dealerships through construction and acquisition is expected to cost between 75.0 million and 115.0 million from a combination of business acquisitions and capital expenditures relating to land, buildings, and improvements. These cost estimates exclude amounts for acquired inventories, which are primarily financed through our Floor Plan Facility. Additionally, the cost estimates do not consider potential funding received through sale leaseback transactions or other means for real estate and construction activities. We are in the early stages of evaluating additional dealership acquisition opportunities and will update our cost estimates in future periodic reports, if necessary, as there are further developments. Factors that could impact the quantity of future locations or the cost to acquire or open those locations include, but are not limited to, our ability to locate potential acquisition targets or greenfield locations in a geographic area and at a cost that meets our success criteria; continued strong cash flow generation to fund these acquisitions and new locations; and availability of financing as discussed above. 2019 Strategic Shift and Active Sports Restructuring See Restructuring above for a summary of the ongoing cash requirements related to our restructuring activities. Supplier Agreement In connection with the divestiture of its RV furniture business CWDS ), we entered into a supplier agreement Supplier Agreement with the buyer that requires us to purchase an aggregate 250.0 million of product over the approximately 10-year term of the Supplier Agreement. See Note 5 Assets Held for Sale and Business Divestiture to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the divestiture of CWDS. Other Cash Requirements or Commitments Substantially all of our new RV inventory and, at times, certain of our used RV inventory is financed under our Floor Plan Facility (defined in Note 3 Inventories and Floor Plan Payables to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). See Summary of Credit Facilities, Other Long-Term Debt, and Finance Lease Arrangements for a summary of the cash requirements related to our indebtedness. Cash requirements relating to the Tax Receivable Agreement liability, operating and finance lease obligations, and service and marketing sponsorship agreements have not materially changed since our Annual Report.

Table of Contents 
 Sources of Liquidity and Capital We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital including cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our various credit facilities, other long-term debt, and finance lease arrangements (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary of Credit Facilities, Other Long-Term Debt, and Finance Lease Arrangements in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q), including additional borrowing capacity where applicable, will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, including the opening of any additional store locations, quarterly cash dividends (as described above), required payments for our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that our cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents or cash available under our Revolving Credit Facility, our Floor Plan Facility, and our Real Estate Facilities, will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and if availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, our Floor Plan Facility, our Real Estate Facilities is not sufficient, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may impose significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all, including the expected additional borrowings noted above and particularly in light of the current macroeconomic uncertainty. See Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business Our ability to operate and expand our business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will depend on the availability of adequate capital included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report. As of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, we had working capital of 397.2 million, 401.3 million, and 523.7 million, respectively, including 28.4 million, 39.6 million, and 53.3 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. Our working capital reflects the cash provided by deferred revenue and gains reported under current liabilities of 100.9 million, 92.4 million, and 99.8 million as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Deferred revenue primarily consists of cash collected for club memberships and roadside assistance contracts in advance of services to be provided, which is deferred and recognized as revenue over the life of the membership, and deferred revenue for the annual guide. We use net proceeds from this deferred membership revenue to lower our long-term borrowings and finance our working capital needs. Our Floor Plan Facility includes a flooring line aggregate interest reduction FLAIR offset account that allows us to transfer cash as an offset to the payables under the Floor Plan Facility. The FLAIR offset account at September 30, 2024 was 151.5 million, 128.3 million of which could have been withdrawn while remaining in compliance with the financial covenants of the Floor Plan Facility. Seasonality We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in revenue, net income, and cash flows as a result of annual seasonality in our business (see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Seasonality to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). Cash Flow The following table shows summary cash flow information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 408,541 543,273 Net cash used in investing activities (57,096) (277,535) Net cash used in financing activities (362,712) (342,551) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (11,267) (76,813) Operating activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily collections from contracts in transit and customers following the sale of new and used vehicles, as well as from the sale of retail products 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 and services and Good Sam services and plans. Contracts in transit represent amounts due from third-party lenders from whom pre-arranged agreements have been determined, and to whom the retail installment sales contracts have been assigned. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floor plan payables, payments to retail product suppliers, personnel-related expenditures, payments related to leased property, advertising, and various services and program costs. Net cash provided by operating activities was 408.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 134.7 million from 543.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 119.9 million reduction in net income, a 69.1 million decrease in the working capital adjustment for inventory, a 34.4 million decrease in working capital adjustment for prepaid expenses and other assets, a 7.6 million decrease in deferred income taxes, a 3.5 million decrease in working capital adjustment for operating lease liabilities, a 3.1 million decrease in non-cash lease expense, a 3.0 million increase in gain on lease termination expense, and a 2.1 million decrease in equity-based compensation, partially offset by a 41.0 million increase in working capital adjustment for accounts payable and other accrued expenses, a 34.1 million increase in the working capital adjustment for receivables and contracts in transit, a 14.5 million increase in loss on sale or disposal of assets, a 10.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a 5.3 million increase in the working capital adjustment for deferred revenue, and a 3.1 million increase in long-lived asset impairment. Investing activities. Our investment in business activities primarily consists of expanding our operations through organic growth and the acquisition of RV dealership locations. Substantially all of our new RV dealership locations and capital expenditures have been financed using cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our various credit facilities, other long-term debt, and finance lease arrangements, as applicable (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary of Credit Facilities, Other Long-Term Debt, and Finance Lease Arrangements in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q).

Our financing activities primarily consist of proceeds from the issuance of debt, the repayment of principal, cash dividends to holders of Class A common stock, and cash distributions to holders of CWGS, LLC common units . Our net cash used in financing activities was 362.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The 362.7 million of cash used in financing activities was primarily due to 317.5 million of net payments on borrowings under the Floor Plan Facility , 66.8 million of payments on long-term debt, 32.0 million of payments on the revolving line of credit, 18.8 million of member distributions, 16.9 million of dividends paid on Class A common stock, 5.7 million for finance lease payments, 3.1 million of withholding taxes paid upon the vesting of restricted stock units, and 0.9 million of payment of debt issuance costs, partially offset by 55.6 million of proceeds from long-term debt, 43.0 million from borrowings on revolving line of credit, and 0.5 million of proceeds from exercise of stock options .

Summary of Credit Facilities, Other Long-Term Debt, and Finance Lease Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt in the form of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our Floor Plan Facility, our Real Estate Facilities, other long-term debt, and finance lease obligations. We may from time to time seek to refinance, retire or exchange our outstanding debt. Such refinancings, repayments or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. The following table shows a summary of the outstanding balances, current portion, and remaining available borrowings under our credit facilities, other long-term debt and finance lease arrangements (see definitions and further details in Note 3 Inventories and Floor Plan Payables, Note 7 Long-Term Debt, and Note 8 Leases to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) at September 30, 2024: 

Current Remaining (In thousands) Outstanding Portion Available Floor Plan Facility: Notes payable - floor plan 1,030,187 1,030,187 572,827 (1) Revolving line of credit 31,885 38,115 (2) Senior Secured Credit Facilities: Term Loan Facility 1,338,321 14,015 Revolving Credit Facility 22,750 (3) Other: Real Estate Facilities 183,497 (4) 9,450 57,390 (4) Other long-term debt 8,007 333 Finance lease obligations 139,861 7,077 2,731,758 1,061,062 691,082 
 (1) The unencumbered borrowing capacity for the Floor Plan Facility represents the additional borrowing capacity less any accounts payable for sold inventory and less any purchase commitments. Additional borrowings are subject to the vehicle collateral requirements under the Floor Plan Facility. The Floor Plan Facility also includes an accordion feature allowing us, at our option, to request to increase the aggregate amount of the floor plan notes payable in 50.0 million increments up to a maximum amount of 300.0 million. The Floor Plan Lenders are not under any obligation to provide commitments in respect of any future increase under the accordion feature. (2) The revolving line of credit borrowings are subject to a borrowing base calculation but were not limited as of September 30, 2024.

 (3) The Revolving Credit Facility remaining available balance was reduced by outstanding undrawn letters of credit. The Credit Agreement requires compliance with a Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant when borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding certain amounts relating to letters of credit) is over a 35 , or 22.8 million, threshold (Note 7 Long-Term Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). The otherwise remaining available borrowings of 60.1 million were reduced by 37.3 million to 22.8 million in light of this financial covenant at September 30, 2024. (4) Additional borrowings on the Real Estate Facilities are subject to a debt service coverage ratio covenant and to the property collateral requirements under the Real Estate Facilities. In August 2024, we amended the M T Real Estate Facility to increase the borrowing capacity by 50.0 million, which was not deducted from our option to request an additional 100.0 million of principal capacity. The lenders under the M T Real Estate Facility are not under any obligation to provide commitments in respect of any such increase. We have experienced an increase in interest rates, which have begun to decrease and are expected to continue to decrease during the remainder of 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the applicable interest rate for the floor plan notes payable under the Floor Plan Facility was 7.47 and 7.27 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average interest rate for the Term Loan Facility was 7.47 and 7.95 , respectively. The previous increase in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, a higher average outstanding floor plan balance have resulted in a combined year-over-year increase of our floor plan interest expense and other interest expense, net of 3.2 million and 25.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Sale/Leaseback Arrangements We have in the past and may in the future enter into sale-leaseback transactions to finance certain property acquisitions and capital expenditures, pursuant to which we sell property and/or leasehold improvements to third parties and agree to lease those assets back for a certain period of time. Such sales generate proceeds which vary from period to period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into sale-leaseback transactions for three properties associated with store locations in the RV and Outdoor Retail segment. We received consideration of 37.7 million of cash and recorded a gain of 0.4 million that is included in loss (gain) on sale or disposal of assets in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We entered into 20-year lease agreements for two of the properties and a 17-year lease agreement for one of the properties. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue consists of our sales for products not yet recognized as revenue at the end of a given period. Our deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 was 168.5 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and in doing so, we have to make estimates, assumptions and judgments affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change our results from those reported. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. There has been no material change in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those previously reported and disclosed in our Annual Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Part I of this Form 10-Q.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a discussion of the Company s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks, in our Annual Report. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in this information. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Part II. Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Part I of this Form 10-Q. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report other than with respect to the risk factors described below. Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, has substantial control over us, including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and his interests, along with the interests of our other Continuing Equity Owners, in our business may conflict with yours. We entered into a voting agreement in connection with our IPO with ML Acquisition Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is indirectly owned by each of the estate of our former director, Stephen Adams, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis ML Acquisition ), ML RV Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, wholly owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis ML RV Group ), CVRV Acquisition LLC and CVRV Acquisition II LLC (the Voting Agreement ). Subject to the Voting Agreement, Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, may approve or disapprove substantially all

Table of Contents 
 transactions and other matters requiring approval by our stockholders, such as a merger, consolidation, dissolution or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, the issuance or redemption of certain additional equity interests, and the election of directors including transactions that may not be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock or, conversely, prevent the consummation of transactions that may be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock. As discussed further under Part II, Item 5 below, we have been made aware of the anticipated dissolution of ML Acquisition and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CWGS Holding, LLC CWGS Holding effective December 31, 2024. In connection with the anticipated dissolution, the Company expects that Common Units of CWGS Enterprises, LLC and Class B Common Stock of the Company held by CWGS Holding will be distributed to the members of ML Acquisition Company (such distributees, the ML Related Parties and such transactions, the Distribution ). In addition, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Crestview Advisors, L.L.C., a registered investment adviser to private equity funds, including funds affiliated with Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. Crestview currently has the right to designate one of our directors (the Crestview Director ). Each of ML Acquisition and ML RV Group has agreed to vote, or cause to vote, all of their outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders in which directors are elected, so as to cause the election of the Crestview Director. In addition, the ML Related Parties also currently have the right to designate four of our directors (the ML Acquisition Directors ). Moreover, ML RV Group has the right to designate one director for as long as it holds our one share of Class C common stock (the ML RV Director ). As described in the Voting Agreement, these designation rights are subject to change based on the relevant parties ownership of Class A common stock. Funds controlled by Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. have agreed to vote, or cause to vote, all of their outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders in which directors are elected, so as to cause the election of the ML Acquisition Directors and the ML RV Director. Additionally, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, we are required to take commercially reasonable action to cause (i) the Board of Directors to be comprised at least of nine directors absent an appropriate waiver or approval to increase or decrease the size of the Board (which the Company obtained to set the Board at eight directors); (ii) the individuals designated in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement to be included in the slate of nominees to be elected to the Board of Directors at the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company at which directors are to be elected and at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company thereafter at which a director s term expires; (iii) the individuals designated in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement to fill the applicable vacancies on the Board of Directors; and (iv) a ML Acquisition Director or the ML RV Director to be the chairperson of the Board of Directors (as defined in our amended and restated bylaws). The Voting Agreement allows for the Board of Directors to reject the nomination, appointment or election of a particular director if such nomination, appointment or election would constitute a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the Company s stockholders or does not otherwise comply with any requirements of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or the charter for, or related guidelines of, the Board of Directors Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Following the Distribution, the ML Related Parties collectively will continue to be entitled to designate four (4) directors to the Board. The ML Related Parties will no longer be obligated to vote, or cause to be voted, all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock previously held by ML Acquisition at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company at which directors of the Company are to be elected so as to cause the election of the director designated to serve by Crestview. However, ML RV Group will be required to vote, or cause to be voted, its share of Class C Common Stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company at which directors of the Company are to be elected so as to cause the election of the Crestview Director. In addition, the ML Related Parties will not have any voting obligations relating to the directors designated by the ML Related Parties. While the Crestview Stockholders will still be obligated to vote for the ML Acquisition Directors and the director designated to serve on the Board by ML RV Group, there will no longer be an individual, group or company that holds more than 50 of the voting power for the election of the Company s directors and the Company will therefore no longer qualify as a controlled company under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, absent an agreement between the ML Acquisition Members and Crestview as to future director elections. For additional information, see We are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE listing requirements and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements.

 The Voting Agreement further provides that, for so long as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, 22.5 or more of our Class A common stock (assuming that all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC are redeemed for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis), the approval of ML Acquisition will be required for certain corporate actions. These actions include: (1) a change of control; (2) acquisitions or dispositions of assets above 100 million; (3) the issuance of securities of Camping World Holdings, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (other than under equity incentive plans that have received the prior approval of our Board of Directors); (4) material amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; and (5) any change in the size of the Board of Directors. The Voting Agreement also provides that, for so long as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, 27.5 or more of our Class A common stock (assuming that all outstanding common units of CWGS, LLC are redeemed for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis), the approval of ML Acquisition, as applicable, will be required for the hiring and termination of our Chief Executive Officer; provided, however, that the approval of the ML Related Parties is only required at such time as Marcus Lemonis no longer serves as our Chief Executive Officer. These rights may prevent the consummation of transactions that may be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock. Following the Distribution, the ML Related Parties will no longer have the foregoing consent rights described above that were previously held by ML Acquisition. We are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE listing requirements and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements. Pursuant to the terms of the Voting Agreement, Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, and certain funds controlled by Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., in the aggregate, have more than 50 of the voting power for the election of directors, and, as a result, we are considered a controlled company for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE listing requirements. As such, we qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements to have a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors, an entirely independent Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, an entirely independent Compensation Committee or to perform an annual performance evaluation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees. The corporate governance requirements and specifically the independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who are considered independent are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We have utilized, and may continue to utilize, certain exemptions afforded to a controlled company. As a result, we are not subject to certain corporate governance requirements, including that a majority of our Board of Directors consists of independent directors, as defined under the rules of the NYSE. In addition, we are not required to have a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or Compensation Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities or to conduct annual performance evaluations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. Following the Distribution, the Company anticipates that it will no longer be considered a controlled company under the rules of the NYSE, and therefore we will no longer be able to rely on the exemptions from corporate governance requirements that are afforded to controlled companies. We may not be able to come into compliance with the corporate governance requirements on the timelines required by the NYSE, which could cause us to be non-compliant with NYSE continued listing requirements and potentially subject to the delisting process. If we are unable to retain senior executives and attract and retain other qualified employees, our business might be adversely affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, sales, marketing, and service personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is high. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully and, in such an 

 62 

Table of Contents 
 event, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our success also depends to a significant extent on the continued service and performance of our senior management team, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis. The loss of any member of our senior management team, or our failure to successfully manage any transitions in senior management or the integration of senior management into new roles could impair our ability to execute our business plan and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, on June 1, 2024, Brent L. Moody, our President at the time, and Karin L. Bell, our Chief Financial Officer at the time, announced their resignations from their President and Chief Financial Officer positions, respectively, effective July 1, 2024 and each transitioned to a role of Senior Advisor through their retirement dates of December 31, 2024 for Mr. Moody and the date that we file our Form 10-K with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2024 for Ms. Bell. Mr. Moody will continue to serve as a member of our Board of Directors. Effective July 1, 2024, Matthew D. Wagner was appointed as our President and will continue to serve as our principal operating officer. Additionally, effective July 1, 2024, Thomas E. Kirn was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer and principal financial officer. He will continue to serve as our principal accounting officer. Additionally, certain members of our management team, including Mr. Lemonis, currently pursue and may continue to pursue other business ventures, which could divert their attention from executing on our business plan and objectives. We do not currently maintain key-man life insurance policies on any member of our senior management team or other key employees. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds The following table presents information related to our repurchases of Class A common stock for the periods indicated: 

Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Programs (1) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Programs (1) July 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024 120,166,000 August 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024 120,166,000 September 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 120,166,000 Total 120,166,000 (1) On October 30, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of the Company s Class A common stock, expiring on October 31, 2022. In August 2021 and January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized increases to the stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 125.0 million and 152.7 million of the Company s Class A common stock, respectively. Following these extensions, the stock repurchase program now expires on December 31, 2025. This program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of Class A common stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the board s discretion. 
 The table above excludes shares net settled by the Company in connection with tax withholdings associated with the vesting of restricted stock units as these shares were not issued and outstanding. Since we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock depends on our receipt of cash distributions from CWGS, LLC and, through CWGS, LLC, cash distributions and dividends from its operating subsidiaries, which may restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization, agreements of our subsidiaries or covenants under any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. In particular, our ability to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock is limited by restrictions on the ability of CWGS, LLC and our other subsidiaries and us to pay dividends or make distributions to us under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Floor Plan Facility. See Dividend Policy included in Part II, Item 5 of our Annual Report and Risk Factors Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock Our ability to pay regular and special dividends on our Class A common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our structure and statutory restrictions included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None.

 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information (a) Disclosure in lieu of reporting on a Current Report on Form 8-K. 
 The Company has been made aware of the anticipated dissolution of ML Acquisition Company, LLC ("ML Acquisition Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CWGS Holding, LLC CWGS Holding and, together with ML Acquisition Company, ML Acquisition ), effective December 31, 2024. CWGS Holding is currently the record holder of 32,584,700 common units of CWGS Enterprises, LLC Common Units and an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company. In connection with the anticipated dissolution, the Company expects that Common Units of CWGS Enterprises, LLC and Class B Common Stock of the Company held by CWGS Holding will be distributed to the members of ML Acquisition Company (the Distribution ). The members of ML Acquisition Company are ML RV Group, LLC ML RV Group ), which is wholly owned by the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis, and AGI Holding Corp. AGI ), which the Company believes is wholly owned by The Stephens Adam Living Trust, the former trustee of which was the Company s former director, Stephen Adams, prior to his death (together, the ML Acquisition Members ). These members are considered Permitted Transferees of ML Acquisition as defined in the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of CWGS Enterprises, LLC. ML Acquisition and the ML Acquisition Members together with any future Permitted Transferees are referred to as ML Related Parties . Following the Distribution, the Company anticipates that it will no longer be considered a controlled company under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and that there will be certain impacts to provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Charter ), Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ), and Voting Agreement, dated October 6, 2016, between the Company, CWGS Holding, ML RV Group, CVRV Acquisition II LLC and CVRV Acquisition LLC (together with their Permitted Transferees, the Crestview Stockholders and Crestview Advisors L.L.C. Crestview (the Voting Agreement , including, but not limited to the following (which assumes that the equity ownership of ML Acquisition does not change prior to the Distribution): Voting Agreement: The ML Related Parties will no longer have the consent rights previously held by ML Acquisition under the Voting Agreement as previously disclosed in our definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 3, 2024 (the 2024 Proxy ). The ML Related Parties collectively will continue to be entitled to designate four (4) directors (the ML Acquisition Directors to the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ). Currently, Andris A. Baltins and K. Dillon Schickli serve as the ML Acquisition Directors. If the equity ownership of the ML Related Parties decreases, the number of ML Acquisition Directors that the ML Related Parties are entitled to designate will decline at the thresholds previously disclosed in the 2024 Proxy. The ML Related Parties will no longer be obligated to vote, or cause to be voted, all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock previously held by ML Acquisition at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company at which directors of the Company are to be elected, or to take all Necessary Action (as defined in the Voting Agreement) to cause the election of the director designated to serve by Crestview Advisors L.L.C. However, ML RV Group will be required to vote, or cause to be voted, its share of Class C Common Stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company at which directors of the Company are to be elected, or to take all Necessary Action to cause the election of the Crestview Director. In addition, the ML Related Parties will not have any voting obligations relating to the directors designated by the ML Related Parties. While the Crestview Stockholders will still be obligated to vote for the ML Acquisition Directors and the director designated 

 64 

Table of Contents 
 to serve on the Board by ML RV Group, there will no longer be an individual, group or company that holds more than 50 of the voting power for the election of the Company s directors and the Company will therefore no longer qualify as a controlled company under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, absent an agreement between the ML Acquisition Members and Crestview as to future director elections. 
 Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation: The distributed shares of Class B Common Stock held by the ML Related Parties will collectively be entitled to the number of votes necessary such that the shares, in the aggregate, cast 47 of the total votes eligible to be cast by all holders of the Company s common stock voting together as a single class on all matters presented to a vote of holders of Class B Common Stock at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. Each of the ML Related Parties will receive a pro rata portion of the 47 voting rights that reflects their respective proportional interest in the shares of Class B Common Stock previously held by ML Acquisition. After the ML Related Parties cease to own at least 27.5 of all Common Units issued and outstanding, each share of Class B Common Stock will be entitled to one (1) vote per share. The share of Class C Common Stock held by ML RV Group will continue to entitle ML RV Group to the number of votes necessary such that it casts 5 of the total votes eligible to be cast by all holders of the Company s common stock voting together as a single class. However, a Change of Control , as defined in the Charter, occurs when the ML Related Parties beneficially own, directly or indirectly, less than 27.5 of all outstanding Common Units, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The share of Class C Common Stock held by ML RV Group will lose all voting rights (5 upon the occurrence of a Change of Control. 
 Immediately following the Distribution, the Company anticipates that ML RV Group will hold no more than 16 of the Common Units and Class B Common Stock currently held by ML Acquisition (or 5,213,552 Common Units and shares of Class B Common Stock) and AGI will hold no less than 84 of the Common Units currently held by ML Acquisition (or 27,371,148 Common Units and shares of Class B Common Stock). Mr. Lemonis also owns or controls one share of Class C Common Stock held by ML RV Group and 155,268 shares of Class A Common Stock held directly by Mr. Lemonis. Mr. Lemonis is expected to have voting power of approximately 12.7 of the Company s Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock voting together as a single class.
