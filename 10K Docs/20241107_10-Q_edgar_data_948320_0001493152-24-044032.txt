Nature
of Business 

The
Company is a direct-to-patient telehealth company providing a high-quality, cost-effective, and convenient way to access comprehensive,
virtual and in-home healthcare. The Company believes the traditional model of visiting a doctor s office, traveling to a retail
pharmacy, and returning for follow up care or prescription refills is complex, inefficient, and costly, and discourages many individuals
from seeking medical care. The Company is improving the delivery of healthcare through telehealth with our proprietary technology platform,
affiliated-and-dedicated provider network, broad and expanding treatment capabilities, and unique ability to nurture patient relationships.
Direct-to-patient telehealth technology companies, like the Company, connect consumers to affiliated, licensed, healthcare professionals
for care across numerous indications, including urgent and primary care, weight management, sleep, hair loss, men s and women s
health, hormonal therapy and dermatology, chronic care management and more. 

The
Company s telehealth platform helps patients access their licensed providers for diagnoses, virtual care, and prescription medications,
often delivered on a recurring basis. In addition to its telehealth prescription offerings, the Company sells over-the-counter OTC products. All products are available on a subscription or membership basis, where a patient can subscribe to receive regular shipments
of prescribed medications or products. This creates convenience and often discounted pricing opportunities for patients and recurring
revenue streams for the Company. 

With
its first brand, ShapiroMD, the Company has built a full line of proprietary OTC products for male and female hair loss including
Food and Drug Administration FDA approved OTC minoxidil and an FDA-cleared medical device and now a personalized
telehealth platform offering that gives consumers access to virtual medical treatment from their providers and, when appropriate, a full
line of oral and topical prescription medications for hair loss. The Company s men s brand, RexMD, currently offers access
to provider-based treatment for erectile dysfunction, as well as treatment for other common men s health issues, including premature
ejaculation and hair loss. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company launched NavaMD, a tele-dermatology and skincare brand for women.
The Company has built a platform that allows it to efficiently launch telehealth and wellness product lines wherever it determines there
is a market need. 

In
the first quarter of 2022, we launched our virtual primary care offering under the LifeMD brand, LifeMD Primary Care. This offering provides
patients with 24/7 access to an affiliated high-quality provider for their primary care, urgent care, and chronic care needs. 

In
April 2023, we launched our GLP-1 Weight Management program providing primary care, weight loss, holistic healthcare, lab work and prescription
services, as appropriate, to patients seeking to access a medically supported weight loss solution. In September 2024, we expanded our
Weight Management program with an alternative designed for patients who are unable or unwilling to use GLP-1 medications. This treatment
plan consists of three oral medications metformin, bupropion, and topiramate. 

Business
and Subsidiary History 

In
June 2018, the Company closed the strategic acquisition of of WorkSimpli. As a result of various ownership restructurings, the Company s
ownership interest in WorkSimpli is as of December 31, 2023. See Note 8 for additional information. 

On
January 18, 2022, the Company acquired Cleared, a nationwide allergy telehealth platform that provides personalized treatments for allergy,
asthma, and immunology. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Cleared at closing in exchange
for a thousand upfront cash payment, and two non-contingent milestone payments for a total of million million each
on or before the first and second anniversaries of the closing date). The Company purchased a convertible note from a strategic pharmaceutical
investor for thousand which was converted upon closing of the Cleared acquisition. The Company also agreed to a performance-based
earnout based on Cleared s future net sales, payable in cash or shares at the Company s discretion. On February 4, 2023,
the Company entered into the First Amendment (the Cleared First Amendment to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated January
11, 2022, between the Company and the sellers of Cleared (the Cleared Stock Purchase Agreement ). The Cleared Stock Purchase
Agreement was amended to, among other things: (i) reduce the total purchase price by thousand to a total of million; (ii)
change the timing of the payment of the purchase price to thousand paid at closing (which has already been paid by the Company),
with the remaining amount to be paid in five quarterly installments beginning on or before February 6, 2023 and ending January 15, 2024;
(iii) remove all earn-out payments payable by the Company to the sellers; and (iv) remove certain representations and warranties
of the Company and sellers in connection with the transaction (See Note 3). The Company issued the following shares of common stock to
the sellers of Cleared under the Cleared First Amendment: (1) shares on February 6, 2023, (2) shares on April 17, 2023,
(3) shares on July 17, 2023, (4) shares on October 17, 2023 and (5) shares on January 16, 2024. 

In
February 2022, WorkSimpli closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement (the ResumeBuild APA with East Fusion FZCO, a Dubai, UAE
corporation (the Seller ), whereby WorkSimpli acquired substantially all of the assets associated with the Seller s
business, offering subscription-based resume building software through software as a service online platforms (the Acquisition ).
WorkSimpli paid million to the Seller upon closing. The Seller is also entitled to a minimum of thousand to be paid out in
quarterly payments equal to the greater of of net profits (as defined in the ResumeBuild APA) or approximately thousand, for
a two-year period ending on the two-year anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition. As of September 30, 2024, WorkSimpli has paid
the Seller thousand in accordance with the ResumeBuild APA. WorkSimpli borrowed the purchase price from the Company pursuant to
a promissory note with the obligation secured by an equity purchase guarantee agreement and a stock option pledge agreement from Fitzpatrick
Consulting, LLC and its sole member Sean Fitzpatrick, who is Co-Founder and President of WorkSimpli (See Note 3). As of September 30,
2024, there is no remaining balance outstanding related to the promissory note. 

Unless
otherwise indicated, the terms LifeMD, Company, we, us, and our 
refer to LifeMD, Inc. (formerly known as Conversion Labs, Inc.), Cleared, a Delaware public benefit corporation and our majority-owned
subsidiary, WorkSimpli. The affiliated network of medical Professional Corporations and medical Professional Associations administratively
led by LifeMD Southern Patient Medical Care, P.C. LifeMD PC is the Company s affiliated, variable interest entity
in which we hold a controlling financial interest. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars. 

Liquidity
Evaluation 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately million and has experienced significant losses from
its operations. Although the Company is showing significant positive revenue trends, the Company expects to incur further losses through
2024. Additionally, the Company expects its burn rate of cash to continue to improve and to maintain positive operating cash flows for
the next 12 months following the date of this report. To date, the Company has been funding operations primarily through the sales of
its products, issuance of common and preferred stock, and through loans and advances. The Company s continued operations are dependent
upon obtaining an increase in its sale volumes or the issuance of additional shares of common stock. There can be no assurances that
we will be successful in increasing revenues and improving operational efficiencies. 

On

Business
Overview 

We
are a direct-to-patient telehealth company providing a high-quality, cost-effective, and convenient way to access comprehensive, virtual
and in-home healthcare. We believe the traditional model of visiting a doctor s office, traveling to a retail pharmacy, and returning
for follow up care or prescription refills is complex, inefficient, and costly, and discourages many individuals from seeking much needed
medical care. LifeMD is improving the delivery of healthcare experience through telehealth with our proprietary technology platform,
affiliated and dedicated provider network, broad and expanding treatment capabilities, and unique ability to nurture patient relationships. 

The
LifeMD telehealth platform integrates best-in-class capabilities including a 50-state medical group, a nationwide pharmacy network, nationwide
laboratory and diagnostic testing capabilities, a fully integrated electronic medical records EMR system and an internal
patient care and service call center. These capabilities are integrated by an industry-leading, proprietary telehealth technology that
supports a broad range of primary care, chronic disease and lifestyle healthcare needs. Currently, LifeMD treats approximately 269,000
active patient subscribers across a range of their medical needs including primary care, men s sexual health, weight management,
sleep, hair loss and hormonal therapy by providing telehealth clinical services and prescription and over-the-counter OTC treatments, as medically appropriate. Our virtual primary care services are primarily offered on a subscription basis. Since inception,
we have helped approximately 1,059,000 customers and patients by providing them greater access to high-quality, convenient, and affordable
care. 

Our
mission is to empower people to live healthier lives by increasing access to high-quality and affordable virtual and in-home healthcare.
We believe our success has been, and will continue to be, attributable to an amazing patient experience, made possible by attracting
and retaining the highest-quality providers in the country, and our proprietary end-to-end technology platform. As we continue to pursue
long-term growth, we plan to continue to introduce new telehealth product and service offerings that complement our already expansive
treatment areas. During April 2023, we launched a highly successful and differentiated GLP-1 Weight Management offering driven by our
existing primary care capabilities that already had more than 71,000 patient subscribers as of September 30, 2024. Patients receive a
range of weight loss services including prescriptions for GLP-1 medications, as medically appropriate, lab work services, general primary
care and holistic healthcare and coaching. The GLP-1 medically supported weight loss market is rapidly growing and is projected to increase
from over 13 billion to over 100 billion by 2030, according to J.P. Morgan Research. 

Our
telehealth revenue increased 62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Total revenue from recurring subscriptions is approximately 92 . In addition to our telehealth business, we own 73.32 of WorkSimpli,
which operates PDFSimpli, a rapidly growing software as a service platform for converting, signing, editing, and sharing PDF documents.
WorkSimpli revenue from recurring subscriptions is 100 .

Our
Platform and Business Strategy 

We
are a patient-centric telehealth company dedicated to delivering seamless end-to-end virtual healthcare directly to consumers and through
select enterprise B2B partnerships. Our mission is facilitated by our robust technology platform that is purpose-built
to seamlessly connect the various touchpoints involved in delivering complex care, including scheduling for a national provider network,
EMR capabilities, secure synchronous and asynchronous communication, digital prescriptions, cloud pharmacy and more. Our platform enables
us to deliver modern personalized health experiences and offerings through our websites and mobile applications, spanning customer discovery,
purchase and connection with licensed providers, to pharmacy and OTC order fulfillment, through ongoing care. We believe that our seamless
approach significantly reduces the complication, cost and time burden of healthcare, incentivizing consumers to stick with our brands. 

Our
offerings are sold to consumers on a subscription basis thus creating a relationship-driven patient experience to bolster retention rates
and recurring revenue. Our offerings range from prescription medication and OTC products fulfilled on a recurring basis, to primary care
and weight management clinical services and ongoing care from a team of dedicated medical providers. In general, our offerings seek to
serve a patient throughout the lifecycle of both their general and chronic healthcare needs. As appropriate, prescription medications
and OTC products are filled by pharmacy fulfillment partners, and are shipped directly to the patient. The number of patients and customers
we serve across the nation continues to increase at a robust pace, with approximately 1,059,000 individuals having purchased our products
and services to date. 

Our
platform also includes a robust customer relationship management CRM system, and performance marketing platform that
enables us to acquire and retain new patients and customers at scale by driving brand visibility through strategic media placements,
influencer partnerships, and direct response advertising methods across highly visible marketing channels i.e ., national TV,
streaming TV, streaming audio, YouTube, podcasts, Out of Home, print, magazines, online search, social media, and digital). 

We
leverage our telehealth technology platform and services across the three core areas described below: 

Direct-to-Consumer
Virtual Primary Care 

In
the first quarter of 2022, we launched our flagship virtual primary care offering under the LifeMD brand, LifeMD PC. This offering provides
patients with 24/7 access to an affiliated high-quality provider for their primary care, urgent care, and chronic care needs. LifeMD s
virtual primary care offering is a mobile-first full-service destination that provides seamless access to high-quality clinical care
including virtual consultations and treatment, prescription medications, diagnostics and imaging, wellness coaching and more. This offering
is also supported by robust partnerships that provide our patients benefits such as substantial discounts on lab work and a prescription
discount card that can be presented at over 60,000 pharmacies to save up to 92 on their prescription medication. 

In
April 2023, we launched our rapidly growing GLP-1 Weight Management program providing primary care, weight loss, holistic healthcare,
lab work and prescription services, as appropriate, to patients seeking to access a medically supported weight loss solution. Since inception,
our Weight Management program has grown exponentially to over 71,000 patient subscribers as of September 30, 2024. We remain at the forefront
of the rapidly growing GLP-1 weight loss market, which is expected to exceed 100 billion by 2030, with our highly differentiated and
comprehensive offering. In September 2024, we expanded our Weight Management program with an alternative designed for patients who are
unable or unwilling to use GLP-1 medications. This treatment plan consists of three oral medications metformin, bupropion, and
topiramate. 

Direct-to-Patient
Telehealth 

We
also leverage our telehealth platform s provider network, cloud pharmacy, and EMR capabilities across our direct-to-patient telehealth
brands. Our telehealth brands RexMD, ShapiroMD, NavaMD, and Cleared address largely unaddressed or underserved needs and are leading
destinations in their respective treatment verticals of men s health, hair loss, dermatology, and immunology. 

RexMD
 is a men s telehealth platform brand that offers access to virtual medical treatment for a variety of men s health
 needs. After treatment from an affiliated licensed physician, if appropriate, one of our partner pharmacies will dispense and ship
 prescription medications and OTC products directly to the customer. Since RexMD s initial launch in the erectile dysfunction
 treatment market, it has expanded into additional indications including but not limited to, premature ejaculation, hormone therapy
 and hair loss. RexMD has served approximately 578,000 customers and patients since inception with a 4.6-star Trustpilot rating. 

ShapiroMD
 offers access to virtual medical treatment, prescription medications, patented doctor formulated OTC products, topical compounded
 medications and Food and Drug Administration FDA approved medical devices treating male and female hair loss through
 our telehealth platform. ShapiroMD has emerged as a leading destination for hair loss treatment across the United States U.S. and has served approximately 265,000 customers and patients since inception with a 4.9-star Trustpilot rating. 

29 

NavaMD
 is a female-oriented, tele-dermatology brand that offers access to virtual medical treatment from dermatologists and other providers,
 and, if appropriate, prescription oral and compounded topical medications to treat dermatological conditions such as aging and acne.
 In addition to the brand s telehealth offerings, NavaMD s proprietary products leverage intellectual property and proprietary
 formulations licensed from Restorsea, a leading medical-grade skincare technology platform. 

Cleared
 is a telehealth brand that provides personalized treatments for allergy, asthma and immunology. Offerings include in-home tests
 for both environmental and food allergies, prescriptions for allergies and asthma and FDA-approved immunotherapies for treating chronic
 allergies. Cleared leverages a 50-state network of affiliated medical professionals and providers, various pharmaceutical partners
 and treatments and tests that cost up to 50 less than the brand-name competition. The offerings include free consultations, prescription
 medication, complementary OTC products and ongoing care from U.S.-licensed allergists and nurses. 

B2B
Telehealth Partnerships 

Organizations
selling healthcare products face a challenging commercial landscape. Increased competition, shrinking market sizes and challenges reaching
patients via the traditional brick-and-mortar physician offices are forcing pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic companies to
rethink their commercial strategies and increase their focus on digital patient awareness and engagement initiatives. It is estimated
that spending on digital solutions to facilitate greater access to end markets accounts for one-third of the collective 30 billion commercial
spend by these companies in the U.S. We believe LifeMD s unique telehealth technology platform and virtual care expertise is well-positioned
to address the unmet needs of healthcare product companies as they relate to digital patient awareness, access to care, adherence and
compliance. To date, LifeMD has executed the following enterprise commercial agreements providing access to our industry leading telehealth
platform capabilities. 

In
 September 2023, LifeMD executed a partnership agreement with ASCEND Therapeutics, LLC ASCEND ), a subsidiary of Besins
 Healthcare, and a specialty pharmaceutical company concentrating on women s health, to provide integrated telehealth services
 to improve access to EstroGel . Under the terms of the agreement, LifeMD receives fees related to certain corporate services
 provided to ASCEND while having our telehealth services featured on the www.estrogel.com website. 

On
December 11, 2023, the Company entered into a collaboration with Medifast, Inc. through and with certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries Medifast ). Medifast will utilize the Company s virtual care technology platform to provide its clients access to
a clinically supported weight management program, including GLP-1 medications, which are a class of medications that mainly help manage
blood sugar (glucose) levels in people with Type 2 diabetes but can also treat obesity. Pursuant to certain agreements between the parties,
Medifast has agreed to pay to the Company the amount of 10 million to support the collaboration, funding enhancements to the Company
platform, operations and supporting infrastructure, of which 5 million was paid at the closing on December 12, 2023, 2.5 million was
paid during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and the remaining 2.5 million was paid during the three months ended June 30, 2024
(the Medifast Collaboration ). 

In
 addition, in connection with the Medifast Collaboration, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement and registration rights
 agreement with Medifast s wholly-owned subsidiary, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., whereby the Company issued 1,224,425 shares
 of its common stock in a private placement (the Medifast Private Placement at a purchase price of 8.1671 per share,
 for aggregate proceeds of approximately 10 million. The Company granted Jason Pharmaceuticals the right, for a period contemporaneous
 with the ongoing collaboration, to appoint one non-voting observer to the Board of Directors of the Company, entitled to attend Board
 meetings. 

Manufacturing
and Supply Chain 

We
use third parties to manufacture and package our OTC products according to the formulas and packaging guidelines we dictate. In order
to minimize costs, we may elect to purchase raw or bulk materials directly from our suppliers and have them shipped to our manufacturers
so that we may incur only tableting, encapsulating, and/or packaging costs and avoid the additional costs associated with purchasing
the finished product. 

FDA
potential restrictions on compounding of GLP-1s, including removal of tirzepatide (marketed as Mounjaro and Zepbound and/or
semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic and Wegovy from the drug shortage list, have the potential to disrupt patient treatment continuity,
by limiting our ability to provide personalized treatment plans that meet individual patient needs, and could adversely impact our financial
results. These restrictions may lead to decreased patient satisfaction, increased attrition rates, and potential legal challenges if
patients are unable to access needed medications in a timely manner. Additionally, the inability to offer compounded options may drive
patients who do not have insurance coverage, or who are unwilling to pay out-of-pocket, for branded GLP-1 medications to seek other medications
and/or alternatives outside of telehealth, adversely impacting the growth and viability of the business.

offset by the Company s net loss of 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 8.8 million, as compared with approximately
 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, was due to cash paid for capitalized software costs of approximately 7.5 million, and cash paid for the purchase of equipment
of approximately 1.3 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to cash paid
for capitalized software costs of approximately 6.3 million, cash paid for the purchase of intangible assets of 149 thousand and cash
paid for the purchase of equipment of approximately 94 thousand. 

Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.7 million as compared with approximately
 14.7 million in net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of: (1) preferred stock dividends of 2.3 million, (2) repayments of notes payable
of approximately 328 thousand, (3) distributions to non-controlling interest of 108 thousand, and (4) the final contingent consideration
payment made related to the ResumeBuild acquisition of approximately 31 thousand, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of
options of approximately 108 thousand. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted
of: (1) 19.5 million in net proceeds received from the Avenue Facility, (2) 2.3 million in proceeds received from notes payable and
(3) 900 thousand in net proceeds received for the sale of common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement (as defined below). These factors
contributing to net cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by repayments of notes payable of approximately 5 million
net of a 325 thousand loss on debt extinguishment on the CRG Financial loan, preferred stock dividends of approximately 2.3 million,
payments made to redeem 500 WorkSimpli membership interest units of approximately 306 thousand, contingent consideration payments made
related to the ResumeBuild brand acquisition of approximately 188 thousand and distributions to non-controlling interest of 108 thousand. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources Outlook 

To
date, the Company has been funding operations primarily through the sales of its products, issuance of common and preferred stock, and
through loans and advances. The Company s continued operations are dependent upon obtaining an increase in its sale volumes or
the issuance of additional shares of common stock. Our primary short-term and long-term requirements for liquidity and capital are for
customer acquisitions, funding business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, working capital including our noncancelable
operating lease obligations, noncontingent consideration, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. For more information on
our operating lease obligations, see Note 9 Leases to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this
report. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in increasing revenues and improving operational efficiencies. 

On
December 11, 2023, the Company entered into a collaboration with Medifast. Pursuant to certain agreements between the parties, Medifast
has agreed to pay to the Company the amount of 10 million to support the collaboration, funding enhancements to the Company platform,
operations and supporting infrastructure, of which 5 million was paid at the closing on December 12, 2023, 2.5 million was paid during
the three months ended March 31, 2024, and the remaining 2.5 million was paid during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

In
addition, in connection with the Medifast Collaboration, on December 11, 2023, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with
Medifast s wholly-owned subsidiary, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., whereby the Company issued 1,224,425 shares of its common stock
in the Medifast Private Placement, at a purchase price of 8.1671 per share, for aggregate proceeds of approximately 10 million. 

35 

On
March 21, 2023, the Company entered into and closed on a Credit Agreement, and a supplement to the Credit Agreement with Avenue. The
Credit Agreement provides for a convertible senior secured credit facility of up to an aggregate amount of 40 million, comprised of
the following: (1) 15 million in term loans funded at closing, (2) 5 million of additional committed term loans which the Company received
on September 26, 2023 under the Avenue First Amendment and (3) 20 million of additional uncommitted term loans, collectively referred
to as the Avenue Facility . The Avenue Facility matures on October 1, 2026. The Company issued Avenue warrants to purchase
 1.2 million of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 1.24, subject to adjustments. In addition, Avenue may convert
up to 2 million of the 15 million in term loans funded at closing into shares of the Company s common stock at any time while
the loans are outstanding, at a price per share equal to 1.49. Proceeds from the Avenue Facility were used to repay the Company s
outstanding notes payable balances with CRG Financial and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. 

On
November 15, 2023, Avenue converted 1 million of the principal amount of the outstanding term loans into shares of the Company s
common stock. This resulted in 672,042 shares of common stock issued to Avenue. Additionally on November 15, 2023, Avenue exercised 96,773
of the Avenue Warrants on a cashless basis resulting in 79,330 shares of the Company s common stock issued. 

The
Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the ATM Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. and
Cantor Fitzgerald Co. relating to the sale of its common stock. In accordance with the terms of the ATM Sales Agreement, the Company
may, but is not obligated to, offer and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 60
million, through or to the Agents, acting as agent or principal. Sales of common stock, if any, will be made by any method permitted
that is deemed an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. On June 7, 2024, the Company
filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, which was declared effective on July 18, 2024 (the 2024
Shelf ). Under the 2024 Shelf at the time of effectiveness, the Company had the ability to raise up to 150.0 million by selling
common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and units including 53.3 million of its common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 53.3 million available under the ATM Sales Agreement, which is part of the 150.0 million
available under the 2024 Shelf. 

The
Company reviewed its forecasted operating results and sources and uses of cash used in management s assessment, which included
the available financing and consideration of positive and negative evidence impacting management s forecasts, market, and industry
factors. Positive indicators that lead to the Company s expectation that it will have sufficient cash over the next 12 months following
the date of this report include: (1) the Company s continued strengthening of the Company s revenues and improvement of operational
efficiencies across the business, (2) the expected improvement in its cash burn rate over the next 12 months and positive operating cash
flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (3) cash on hand of 37.6 million as of September 30, 2024, (4) 53.3 million
available under the ATM Sales Agreement, which is part of the 150.0 million available under the 2024 Shelf, (5) management s ability
to curtail expenses, if necessary, and (6) the overall market value of the telehealth industry, which it believes will continue to drive
interest in the Company already evidenced by the Medifast Collaboration and Medifast Private Placement noted above. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

We
prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which
require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To
the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations
would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after
taking into account our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on
an ongoing basis. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are
not deemed critical, as defined above. 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. We believe that these accounting policies
are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) . The amendments in this update improve reportable segment
disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 will become effective
for the Company s annual period beginning on January 1, 2024 and interim periods within beginning after January 1, 2025. The Company
does not expect the application of ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , to improve its income
tax disclosure requirements. Under ASU 2023-09, entities must annually: (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and
(2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for the
Company beginning on January 1, 2025. The Company does not expect the application of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact to its consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

All
other accounting standards updates that have been issued or proposed by the FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are
not expected to have a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and
procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation
and subject to the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
of our Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its chief executive
and chief financial officers and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the framework
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company s internal control over financial
reporting was not effective. 

A
material weakness, as defined in the standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ),
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

37 

Management
identified the following control deficiencies during the year ended December 31, 2023 that constituted material weaknesses: 

Ineffective
 design, implementation, and operation of controls over program change management, user access and vendor management to ensure: 

(i) 
 information
 technology IT program and data changes affecting the Company s financial IT applications and underlying accounting
 records, are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT systems
 were complete and accurate. Automated process-level and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from such
 financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency; 

(ii) 
 appropriate
 restrictions that would adequately prevent users from gaining inappropriate access to the financially relevant systems; and 

(iii) 
 key
 third-party service provider Systems and Organizational Controls SOC reports were obtained and reviewed. 

Business
 process controls across the entity s financial reporting processes were not effectively designed and implemented to properly
 address the risk of material misstatement from: 

(i) 
 insufficient
 evidence to verify the completeness and accuracy of manually generated Information Produced by the Entity IPE and
 system generated IPE; and 

(ii) 
 insufficient
 evidence of formal review and approval procedures of key information utilized in the performance of the control. 

Management
is in the process of remediating these identified material weaknesses. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 

To
remediate the identified material weaknesses, our management, with oversight from our audit committee, implemented a remediation plan.
The Company has taken the following remediation steps during the year ended December 31, 2023: 

(i) 
 engaged
 an independent third-party consulting firm to conduct internal control walkthroughs and testing and to provide assistance with deficiency
 remediation; 

(ii) 
 prepared
 risk assessments of our financial statement accounts in accordance with the COSO 2013 Framework; 

(iii) 
 developed
 risk and control matrices for critical internal control processes supporting internal control over financial reporting; 

(iv) 
 created
 key process flowcharts, including documentation of key and compensating controls; 

(v) 
 assessed
 the design and operating effectiveness of our controls; 

(vi) 
 identified
 control gaps and weaknesses in the design and operating effectiveness of our controls; 

(vii) 
 implemented
 a ticketing system for user provisioning, modifications, and termination; 

(viii) 
 formalized
 information technology change management processes and retention of audit documentation; 

(ix) 
 established
 policies and procedures related to system backups and monitoring, software development life cycle and cybersecurity; 

(x) 
 started
 to formalize user access and change management reviews as well as SOC report reviews for in-scope third-party systems; and 

(xi) 
 summarized
 our control deficiencies identified to date. 

Management
continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated,
such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The other remediation actions planned include: 

(i) 
 continue
 to formalize accounting and financial reporting policies and procedures including entity-level controls and segregation of duties
 review and analysis; 

(ii) 
 maintain
 evidence of the completeness and accuracy of manually generated IPE and system generated IPE; 

(iii) 
 enhance
 documentation and evidence of review of controls; and 

(iv) 
 continue
 to formalize user access and change management reviews as well as SOC report reviews for in-scope third-party systems. 

The
remediation plan, once fully implemented and determined to be operating effectively, is expected to result in the remediation of the
identified material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control
environment and believe that these remediation efforts will represent significant improvements in our control environment. Our management
will continue to monitor and evaluate the relevance of our risk-based approach and the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures
over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements,
as necessary. 

These
material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement of the company s financial statements; however, they could have resulted in
misstatements of interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement that
would not be prevented or detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

As
discussed above, we are implementing certain measures to remediate the material weaknesses identified in the design and operation of
our internal control over financial reporting. Other than those measures, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially
affected our internal control over financial reporting as of that date.

With or without terminating this Lease, as Landlord may elect, Landlord may reenter and repossess the Demised Premises, or any part thereof,

for a term within or beyond the Term of this Lease. Any such reletting prior to termination shall be for the account of Tenant. Tenant

due hereunder without in any way affecting Tenant s obligation to Landlord hereunder. Such agency, being given for security, is
hereby declared to be irrevocable. 

19.3

Default, or if Landlord incurs any expense, including reasonable counsel fees, in instituting, prosecuting or defending against any action
or proceeding instituted by reason of any default or threatened default of Tenant hereunder, the amount of such payments or expenses
shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as additional rent within five days after Tenant s receipt of Landlord s demand therefor. 

15 

19.5
No waiver by Landlord of any breach by Tenant of any of its obligations, agreements or covenants hereunder shall be a waiver of any subsequent
breach or of any other obligation, agreement or covenant, nor shall any forbearance by Landlord to seek a remedy for any breach by Tenant
be a waiver by Landlord of its rights and remedies with respect to such or any subsequent breach. Landlord shall have the right at all
times, any law, usage or custom notwithstanding, to enforce strictly the provisions of this Lease, and the failure of Landlord at any
time or times strictly to enforce any provision hereof shall not be construed as having created a custom or waiver in any way contrary
to the specific provisions of this Lease or as having in any way or manner modified this Lease. 

19.6
Landlord and Tenant shall be entitled to all attorneys fees and all other costs actually incurred in the preparation and service
of any notice or demand hereunder, whether or not a legal action is subsequently commenced, and such fees and costs shall constitute

as of that date. Such termination shall be without prejudice to the rights of either party to recover compensation from the condemning

from any and all claims made or liability, loss, cost, damage and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) assessed against
Lessor by or on behalf of any person, firm or corporation arising by reason of injury to person or property occurring on the Leased Premises,
occasioned in whole or in part by any act or omission of Lessee (including any acts or omission involving radioactive or hazardous substance
on the part of the Lessee or an employee (whether or not acting within the scope of employment), agent, visitor, assign or sub-tenant
of the Lessee), or by reason of any unlawful use of the Leased Premises or any breach, violation or nonperformance of any covenant in
this Lease on the part of the Lessee to be observed or performed, and also for any matter or thing growing out of the occupancy or use
of the Leased Premises by the Lessee or anyone holding or claiming to hold through or under the Lessee. Lessee agrees to pay for all
damage to the Leased Premises, as well as all damage to licensees or invitees thereof, caused by Lessee s misuse or neglect of
the Leased Premises, its apparatus, or appurtenances. Lessor shall not be liable to Lessee for any loss or damage incurred by Lessee
as the result of any act of negligence of any occupant of the Building (or such occupant s guests, invitees, contractors and/or
employees) or by any owner or occupant of property adjoining or contiguous to the Land. 

Lessor
agrees to defend, indemnify, and save harmless the Lessee, and the agents, servants, and employees of the Lessee, against and from any
and all claims made or liability, loss, cost, damage, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) assessed against Lessee
by or on behalf of any person, firm, or corporation arising by reason of injury to person or property occurring on the Leased Premises,
occasioned in whole or in part by any act or omission, including any acts or omissions regarding radioactive or hazardous substances,
on the part of the Lessor or an employee or agent of the Lessor. 

14. QUIET

shall hold and enjoy the Leased Premises for the Term aforesaid, free from interference by the Lessor or by anyone claiming by, through
or under the Lessor, subject, however, to the terms of this Lease. 

15. ASSIGNMENT
AND SUBLETTING. Except as set forth below, Lessee shall not assign or sublease the Leased Premises without Lessor s prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Factors which Lessor may reasonably consider in deciding whether to consent
to an assignment or sublease include (without limitation), (i) the creditworthiness of the proposed assignee or sublessee, (ii) the proposed
use of the Premises, (iii) whether there is other vacant space in the Building, (iv) whether the assignee or sublessee will vacate other
space owned by Lessor, (iv) whether Lessor is negotiating with the proposed sublessee or assignee for a lease of other space owned by
Lessor, and (vi) any renovations to the Premises or special services required by the assignee or sublessee. Lessor will not consent to
an assignment or sublease that might result in a use that conflicts with the rights of any existing tenant. One consent shall not be
the basis for any further consent. Consent to any assignment or sublease by Lessor shall not release the Lessee from its obligations
and liabilities hereunder. 

11 

Notwithstanding
anything in this Lease to the contrary, Lessee may assign this Lease or sublet the Leased Premises or any portion thereof, at any time,
without Lessor s consent to (a) any Affiliate (as defined below) or any entity which owns or is owned by an Affiliate, (b) any
entity acquiring substantially all of the assets of Lessee or (c) another corporation in connection with the merger of Lessee with such
corporation (each of the foregoing, a Permitted Transferee ). As used herein, Affiliate shall mean any entity
which acquires all or a part of Lessee, or which is acquired in whole or in part by Lessee, or which is controlled directly or indirectly
by Lessee, or which entity controls Lessee, directly or indirectly. For purposes of this definition, control shall mean
the ownership of a majority of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation or other majority equity or control interest if the entity
is not a corporation and the possession of power to direct the management and policy of such corporation or such other entity. Lessee
shall be required to provide written notice and all reasonable documentation to confirm such affiliation, acquisition or merger and an
assumption of lease in a form reasonably acceptable to Lessor. 

16.
DEFAULT. 

(a) In
the event of any failure in the payment of Rent or any other sum payable hereunder for ten (10) days after the due date along with written
notice from Lessor demanding payment, such failure shall be a default by Lessee, and the Lessor, without prejudice to any other rights
or remedies that it may have, shall have the right, immediately or any time thereafter, to reenter the Leased Premises and remove all
persons and property from the Leased Premises. In the event the Lessee shall neglect to keep or perform any covenant, agreement or condition
of this Lease (other than the payment of Rent or any other sums due), the Lessor shall give written notice of such failure to the Lessee;
and in the event that such failure is not rectified within twenty (20) days from the date of such notice, then the Lessee shall be in
default of this Lease and the Lessor shall have the right to enter the Leased Premises immediately or at any time thereafter and remove
the Lessee therefrom, without prejudice to any other remedies of the Lessor. In the event of such re-entry, and excluding that which
may result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor, the Lessee hereby waives all claims for damages which may be caused
by the re-entry of the Lessor and will save the Lessor harmless from any loss, cost or damages occasioned Lessor thereby (including reasonable
attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by reason of such re-entry), and no such re-entry shall be considered or construed to
be a forcible entry. 

(b) The
Lessor shall also have the right, at its option, to cure any of Lessee s defaults and charge the cost of such cure to Lessee as
Additional Rent. 

(c) Should
the Lessor elect to re-enter the Leased Premises as herein provided, or should Lessor take possession pursuant to legal proceedings,
it may either terminate this Lease or it may, from time to time, without terminating this Lease, re-let the Leased Premises or any part
thereof on Lessee s account for such time or times and at such rental or rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as the
Lessor in its reasonable discretion may deem advisable, with the right to make alterations and repairs to the Leased Premises, and the
Lessee shall pay the amount of Rent due under this Lease to the date of the beginning of payment of Rent pursuant to any such re-letting,
together with the cost of such re-letting, including attorneys fees occasioned by such re-letting, brokers commissions,
tenant improvement costs and the cost of any repairs to the Leased Premises necessitated by damage caused by Lessee, and the Lessee will
thereafter pay monthly during the remainder of the Term of this Lease the difference, if any, between the rent collected from such re-letting
and the Rent reserved in this Lease if such rent collected is less than that reserved in this Lease. No such re-entry or taking possession
of the Leased Premises by the Lessor shall be construed as an election on its part to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of
such intention be given to the Lessee. Notwithstanding any such re-letting without termination, the Lessor may, at any time after the
occurrence of any default set out in this Section 16, elect to terminate this Lease, and may terminate it by giving written notice to
that effect to the Lessee. 

12 

(d) If
the Lessor shall at any time terminate this Lease on account of any default set out in this Section 16, in addition to other remedies
it may have, it may recover from the Lessee all damages that it may suffer by reason of the termination of this Lease, including, but
not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and other costs of recovering possession of the Leased Premises, and the
excess, if any, of the amount of Rent and other amounts to be paid by the Lessee under the terms of the Lease for the remainder of the
stated Term, over the then reasonable rental value of the Leased Premises for the remainder of the stated Term. 

(e) If,
before or during the Term of this Lease, the Lessee shall be adjudged a bankrupt, or if any proceeding under the federal bankruptcy laws
shall be filed by or against the Lessee, then such occurrence shall be deemed a default of this Lease by Lessee and, upon the happening
of such event, Lessor shall have all the rights and remedies provided herein, and the Lessee shall be liable for all damages sustained
by the Lessor as provided by law. 

(f) If,
before or during the Term of this Lease or any renewal thereof (1) the Lessee shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors,
or (2) a receiver shall be appointed for the property of the Lessee by order of a court of competent jurisdiction by reason of the insolvency
or alleged insolvency or otherwise of the Lessee, or (3) any department of the state or federal government, or any officer thereof authorized
by order of court, shall take possession of the business or property of the Lessee by reason of the insolvency or alleged insolvency
of the Lessee, or (4) execution shall issue on any judgment and be levied against Lessee s interests in the Leased Premises, then,
upon the happening of any one or more of such events, at the option of the Lessor, this Lease may be terminated by the Lessor by written
notice to that effect to the Lessee, and the Lessor shall, in addition to other remedies provided by law in case of default by the Lessee,
be entitled to the damages set out in this Section 16. 

17.
REMOVAL OF LESSEE S PROPERTY. Provided Lessee pays all Rent due Lessor and is not in default hereunder, Lessee shall have the right,
subject to Section 7 hereof, to remove all furniture and equipment from the Leased Premises upon expiration of this Lease.

19. NO
IDENTITY OF INTEREST. The execution of this Lease or the performance of any act pursuant to the provisions hereof shall not be deemed
or construed to have the effect of creating between Lessor and Lessee the relationship of principal and agent or of partnership or of
joint venture and the relationship between them shall be that only of Lessor and Lessee or landlord and tenant. 

20. ENTIRE
UNDERSTANDING; AMENDMENT. This instrument contains the entire understanding and agreement by and between the parties hereto with respect
to the Lease of the Leased Premises, notwithstanding any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements or instruments, and no amendment
to this Lease shall be effective unless the same is in writing and signed by all of the parties hereto. 

21. PERSONAL
REPRESENTATIVES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All rights and privileges provided for hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the personal
representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto. All obligations herein provided shall be binding on the parties hereto,

23. SURRENDER
OF PREMISES. Lessee will deliver up the Leased Premises at the end of the Term or any holdover period in good order and condition, reasonable
wear and tear accepted. 

24. HOLDING
OVER. This tenancy expires at the end of the Lease Term provided in Section 2 without any notice required by or from either party, unless
renewed as specified in Section 2, but it is expressly understood that if Lessee holds over for another month at the end of said Term
or the Renewal Term for any purpose other than the removal of its property, and Lessor accepts Rent for said month, such holding over
shall operate as a renewal of the tenancy for another month and for each additional month Lessor accepts rent, at a rental rate equal
to 125 of the rental payable in the last month of the Term for the first two (2) months and 150 thereafter. Should Lessor require possession
of the Leased Premises, Lessor shall give Lessee seven (7) days to vacate the Leased Premises prior to the end of such holdover period.
If Lessor loses a prospective tenant because Lessee fails to vacate the Premises upon expiration of the Lease or any termination of the
Lease after notice to do so, then Lessee will be liable for such damages as Lessor can prove because of Lessee s wrongful failure
to vacate. 

25. RIGHT
OF ENTRY. The Lessee agrees that the Lessor shall have the right to enter and to grant licenses to enter the Leased Premises at any reasonable
time upon reasonable advance notice to Lessee (a) to examine the Leased Premises, (b) to make alterations and repairs to the Leased Premises
(including the right, during the progress of such alterations or repairs, to keep and store within the Leased Premises all necessary
materials, tools and equipment, provided said storage does not interfere with Lessee s use and occupancy), (c) for any purpose
which the Lessor shall reasonably deem necessary for the operation and maintenance of the Leased Premises, (d) to show the Leased Premises
to a prospective purchaser of the Building or to a prospective lender, or 

(e) within
one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the termination of this Lease, to exhibit the Leased Premises to prospective new tenants of the
Leased Premises, and that no such entry shall render the Lessor liable to any claim or cause of action for loss of or damage to the business
or property of the Lessee, by reason thereof, nor in any manner affect the obligations and covenants of this Lease. 

26. WAIVER.
The waiver by Lessor or Lessee of any breach of any covenant or agreement herein contained shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such
covenant or agreement or any subsequent breach of the same or any other covenant or agreement herein contained. The subsequent acceptance
of Rent hereunder by Lessor shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by Lessee of any covenant or agreement of this
Lease, other than the failure of Lessee to pay the particular Rent so accepted, regardless of Lessor s knowledge of such preceding
breach at the time of acceptance of such breach. 

15 

27. ESTOPPELS/SUBORDINATIONS. 

(a) Within
ten (10) days after request therefor by Lessor, Lessee shall deliver in recordable form a certification to any proposed lender, trustee
or purchaser, certifying that (1) this Lease is unmodified and in full, force and effect (or, if there have been modifications, that
this Lease is in full effect as modified, and identifying such modifications); (2) the dates to which the Rent has been paid; (3) that,
to the best of Lessee s knowledge, no default exists in the observance of this Lease and no event of default has occurred and is
continuing, or specifying each such default or event of default of which Lessee may have knowledge; and (4) any other information Lessor
may reasonably requests, it being intended that any such statement may be relied upon by Lessor s mortgagees or any prospective
purchaser of the interest of Lessor in the Building. 

(b) This
Lease is subject to and subordinate at all times to the lien of existing and future mortgages and deeds of trust on the Leased Premise.
Although no instrument or act on the part of the Lessee shall be necessary to effectuate such subordination, the Lessee will, nevertheless,
execute and deliver such further instruments subordinating this Lease to the lien of all such mortgages and deeds of trust as may be
desired by the Lessor in replacement of the first mortgage loan on the Leased Premises. The Lessee hereby appoints the Lessor its attorney-in-fact,
irrevocably, to execute and deliver any such instruments on behalf of the Lessee. 

28. BANKRUPTCY.
If, pursuant to the insolvency laws (i.e., the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Paragraph 101 et seq., and any federal, state,
foreign or other laws of like impact), Lessee or a trustee of Lessee is permitted to, and elects to, assume or assume and assign this
Lease:

fees and disbursements and any late charge applicable under this Lease, as recited in Lessor s written statement of pecuniary loss
sent to Lessee or the trustee.

(e) In
the case of an assumption and assignment, any and all monies or other consideration payable or otherwise to be delivered in connection
