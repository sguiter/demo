PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 pler Incident 
 On February 13, 2024, SSR Mining Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, SSR Mining, or the Company suspended all operations at its pler property as a result of a significant slip on the heap leach pad (the pler Incident ). Nine employees lost their lives in connection with the pler Incident. 
 Following the pler Incident, the Company focused on four key priorities: (1) the recovery of our missing colleagues; (2) containment of the incident and remediation of the site; (3) the investigation into the root cause of the incident; and (4) preparing for the restart of the pler mine. 
 With respect to our missing colleagues, all nine individuals have been recovered and returned to their families and we continue to support the families and the community members impacted by the pler Incident. 
 All the planned containment infrastructure, including a grout curtain, coffer dam, and buttress, as well as pumping systems and the Sab rl creek diversion, has been successfully installed and is proving to be effective. Public statements from Turkish government officials continue to reiterate that there has been no recordable contamination to local soil, water or air in the sampling locations. 
 In partnership with the Turkish authorities, the Company has continued to progress the remediation at the site. To date, over 16 million tonnes (approximately 86 of the displaced heap leach material has been moved to temporary storage locations, including substantially all the displaced material from the Sab rl Valley. As part of the remediation work, the heap leach pad will be permanently closed, and heap leach processing will no longer take place at pler. We are continuing discussions with Turkish government officials around the final remediation plan, including the approval and construction of the east storage facility, which will permanently store the displaced material. 
 The pler remediation and containment work is estimated to cost between 250.0 to 300.0 million and take a total of 24 to 36 months to complete. In the third quarter of 2024, 48.3 million was spent on remediation activities at pler, bringing total remediation spend since April 1, 2024 to 103.3 million. 
 The initial design of the heap leach facility prepared prior to commencing production in 2010, and each subsequent expansion thereafter, was engineered, reviewed, and approved by independent, third-party engineering firms. Throughout the various stages of construction across the life of the heap leach facility, third-party reviews were also conducted to ensure conformance with the underlying engineering design parameters. 
 The investigations into the cause of the pler Incident began shortly after the event. The Company has commissioned independent experts to review the design, construction, and operation of the heap leach facility. To date, this review has not identified any material non-conformance with the construction or operation of the heap leach facility relative to the third-party engineered design parameters. 
 SSR Mining continues to work closely with the relevant authorities to advance the required permits for the restart of the pler mine. Once all necessary regulatory approvals, including the operating permits, are reinstated, it is anticipated that initial operations at pler could restart within 20 days and would consist of processing a combination of stockpiled ore and ore mined from akmaktepe, while the remediation work continues. 
 As previously disclosed, in November 2023, prior to the pler Incident, a legal challenge was filed in a local court against the pler mine s environmental impact assessment, which was approved in 2021 (the 2021 EIA ). On August 20, 2024, the local court issued a decision cancelling the 2021 EIA due to insufficiencies in the 2021 EIA approval process. The Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, who had originally approved the 2021 EIA, has filed an appeal of the decision, and the Company has filed a simultaneous intervener appeal as well. As previously disclosed, with the cancellation of the 2021 EIA, the operating guidelines at pler revert to those outlined in the Company s prior Environmental Impact Assessment, which was issued in 2014 (the 2014 EIA ). Among other operating considerations, the 2014 EIA prescribes a lower throughput rate for the sulfide plant operations of 6,000 tonnes per day, as compared to 9,000 tonnes per day under the 2021 EIA. 
 3 

At this time, we are not able to estimate or predict when and under what conditions we will resume operations at pler. Additionally, SSR Mining cannot, at this time, assess the entire scope of the impact of operating under the 2014 EIA. For additional information on the pler Incident, including a discussion of the associated risks, see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on February 27, 2024, the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed on May 8, 2024, and for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 filed on July 31, 2024, and the information provided herein.

 interest in, and operational control of, Artmin Madencilik Sanayi Ve Ticaret A. Artmin which owns the Hod Maden gold-copper development project, located in northeastern T rkiye (the Transaction ). Hod Maden was owned by Lidya Madencilik Sanayi ve Ticaret A. Lidya Mines and by Horizon Copper Corp. Horizon prior to the closing of the Transaction. Upon closing of the Transaction, the Company made a million cash payment to Lidya Mines to acquire a interest in Artmin. The Company has the option to acquire an additional interest in Artmin from Lidya Mines for million in structured payments tied to the completion of project construction spending milestones. Additionally, the Company will make contingent payments to Lidya Mines including million in milestone payments payable in accordance with an agreed upon schedule beginning at the start of construction and ending on the first anniversary of commercial production and million payable upon the delineation of an additional gold equivalent ounces of mineral reserves at the Hod Maden project in excess of the project s current mineral reserves and mineral resources.

Exploration and evaluation costs 
 Exploration and evaluation costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 11.4 million compared to 14.9 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. Exploration and evaluation costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 32.9 million compared to 39.4 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023. Exploration and evaluation costs were lower due to reduced drilling activity during 2024 as compared to 2023. Exploration and evaluation costs were primarily related to the Sterling project at Marigold, exploration activities for the Cortaderas project at Puna, and surface exploration for the Amisk project at Seabee. 
 Reclamation and remediation costs 
 Reclamation and remediation costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.4 million as compared to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Reclamation and remediation costs were consistent quarter over quarter. 
 Reclamation and remediation costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 280.1 million as compared to 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Reclamation and remediation costs increased by 273.6 million mainly due to reclamation and remediation costs related to the pler Incident. 
 Care and maintenance 
 Care and maintenance costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 39.4 million. Care and maintenance expense incurred during the third quarter of 2024 represents direct costs not associated with environmental reclamation and remediation costs of 16.5 million and depreciation of 13.3 million during the suspension of operations at pler in addition to direct costs of 7.7 million and depreciation of 1.9 million during the suspension of operations at Seabee during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Care and maintenance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 84.3 million. Care and maintenance expense incurred during 2024 represents direct costs not associated with environmental reclamation and remediation costs of 41.5 million and depreciation of 33.2 million during the suspension of operations at pler in addition to direct costs of 7.7 million and depreciation of 1.9 million during the suspension of operations at Seabee during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Impairment charges 
 Impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 114.6 million. The impairment charges were due to non-cash impairment charges of 114.2 million of heap leach pad inventory and related heap leach facilities due to the pler Incident and non-cash impairment charges of 0.4 million resulting from the damage to plant and equipment due to the forest fires at Seabee. 
 Other operating expense (income), net 
 Other operating expense (income), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.1 million as compared to nil for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is mainly due to 5.4 million in reduction in force payments, 4.0 million of expenses related to the pler Incident, 4.9 million in other taxes, and 0.5 million loss on disposal of assets, partially offset by a change in contingency estimates and expenses related to the pler Incident of 7.9 million. 
 Other operating expense (income), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.2 million as compared to 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is due to 19.3 million of contingencies and expenses related to the pler Incident and 4.9 million in other taxes, partially offset by a 5.1 million net gain on the sale and disposal of assets primarily attributable to the divestiture of San Luis. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.9 million as compared to 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.7 million as compared to 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases were primarily due to lower debt balances outstanding during 2024 following the full repayment of the Term Loan in the third quarter 2023. 
 35 

Other income (expense) 
 Other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.6 million as compared to 11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The changes were mainly due to the reduction in gains on investments and on marketable security sales of 5.5 million and the decrease in interest income of 2.2 million as a result of lower cash balances, partially offset by 4.2 million of other expense. 
 Other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.3 million as compared to 36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes were mainly due to the decrease in interest income of 7.7 million as a result of lower cash balances, reduction in gains on investments and on marketable security sales of 8.7 million, change in fair value of marketable securities of 6.1 million, partially offset by 2.3 million of other expense. 
 Foreign exchange gain (loss) 
 Foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.5 million compared to a loss of 23.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the foreign exchange loss was mainly due to the weakening of the ARS against the USD and its impact on ARS-denominated assets. 
 Foreign exchange loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.6 million compared to a loss of 57.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in foreign exchange loss was mainly comprised of 42.5 million attributable to the weakening of the ARS against the USD and higher ARS-denominated assets at Puna in 2023 as compared to the same period in 2024, and 5.9 million attributable to the weakening of the TRY against the USD at pler in 2023 compared to the same period in 2024, offset by higher TRY-denominated assets at pler in 2024. 
 Income and mining tax benefit (expense) 
 Income and mining tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.9 million as compared to an expense of 68.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of a one-time deferred tax charge of 68.9 million in 2023, following an increase in the corporate tax rate in T rkiye. This was partially offset by a 0.9 million increase in tax expense as a result of various factors including, foreign currency fluctuations, permanent tax differences, and changes in operating income. 
 
 Income and mining tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.6 million as compared to a benefit of 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax benefit was primarily a result of a 73.2 million reduction in the tax benefits from foreign currency fluctuations on the Company s deferred tax liabilities. This reduction in benefit was partially offset by the absence of a one-time deferred tax charge of 68.9 million in 2023, following an increase in the corporate tax rate in T rkiye.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company continues to analyze its liquidity position subsequent to the pler Incident, taking into consideration its available cash and cash equivalents; expected revenues and operating and capital expenditures for the Company s other three mines; potential penalties and fines, restitution, and legal obligations; estimates of reclamation and remediation related costs; and care and maintenance expenditures at pler over the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 334.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, and the Company has no borrowings outstanding on the Second Amended Credit Agreement at this time. Each of the Company s three other mines operates independently and are not dependent on cash flows or operational synergies associated with pler. Based on this analysis, the Company believes that its current liquidity position is sufficient to sustain the operational needs for the Company s three other mines, as well as satisfy reclamation and remediation related costs, monitoring and care and maintenance efforts at pler, for the next twelve months without needing to borrow under its Second Amended Credit Agreement. The Company may still elect to borrow under the Second Amended Credit Agreement or seek alternate sources of capital for any liquidity needs. All debts, liabilities and obligations under the Second Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company s material subsidiaries and secured by certain of the Company s assets and material subsidiaries and pledges of the securities of the Company s material subsidiaries, but does not include the pler assets and subsidiaries and other Alacer entities. 
 To borrow under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, the Company will be required to satisfy certain financial ratios related to interest coverage and net leverage and make certain representations and warranties on a quarterly basis, including assessing financial ratios over a twelve-month period. Subject to the timing of any borrowings we may make under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, if any, we may be required to seek an amendment from the lenders to permit borrowings if we cannot meet the financial ratios or other requirements due to lower cash flows resulting from the pler Incident or otherwise. 
 The Company manages its liquidity risk through the planning, budgeting and forecasting process, which is reviewed and updated on a regular basis, to help determine the funding requirements to support its current operations, expansion and development plans, and by managing its capital structure.

Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes the Company's cash flow activity fo r nine months ended September 30: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 (54,849) 218,566 Cash used in investing activities 
 (103,556) (280,211) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities

 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by (used in) operating activities was (54.8) million compared to 218.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities is mainly due to a 53.2 decrease in gold ounces sold as well as expenditures for remediation and care and maintenance primarily related to the suspension of operations at pler, partially offset by a favorable working capital change and a 18.5 higher average realized gold in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Cash used in investing activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 103.6 million compared to 280.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 176.7 million of cash used in investing activities is mainly due to spend of 120.0 million for the acquisition of the Hod Maden project in 2023 and lower capital expenditures of 59.7 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by (used in) financing activities was 4.6 million compared to (157.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities was mainly due lower cash payments for debt in the amount of 70.2 million, lower dividends paid in the amount of 43.2 million, a decrease in the purchases and cancellation of common shares in the amount of 35.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from related party debt of 13.9 million. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in the Company s contractual obligations since December 31, 2023 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures to assist in understanding the Company's financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are employed by the Company to measure its operating and economic performance and to assist in decision-making, as well as to provide key performance information to senior management. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders will find this information useful to evaluate the Company's operating and financial performance; however, these non-GAAP performance measures do not have any standardized meaning. These performance measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measure - Cash Costs and AISC 
 Cash Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs AISC per payable ounce of gold and respective unit cost measures are non-U.S. GAAP metrics developed by the World Gold Council to provide transparency into the costs associated with producing gold and provide a standard for comparison across the industry. The World Gold Council is a market development organization for the gold industry. 
 The Company uses cash costs per ounce of precious metals sold to monitor its operating performance internally. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is Cost of sales . The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on its cost structure. The Company also believes it is a relevant metric used to understand its operating profitability. When deriving the cost of sales associated with an ounce of precious metal, the Company includes by-product credits, which allows management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold and silver production. 
 AISC includes total Cost of sales incurred at the Company s mining operations, which forms the basis of cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures, sustaining mine-site exploration and evaluation costs, reclamation cost accretion and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. This measure seeks to reflect the ongoing cost of gold and silver production from current operations; therefore, growth capital is excluded. The Company determines sustaining capital to be capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. The Company determines growth capital to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation. 
 The Company believes that AISC provides additional information to management and stakeholders that provides visibility to better define the total costs associated with production and better understanding of the economics of the Company's operations and performance compared to other producers. 
 In deriving the number of ounces of precious metal sold, the Company considers the physical ounces available for sale after the treatment and refining process, commonly referred to as payable metal, as this is what is sold to third parties.

The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP, certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the ability of the Company to generate cash flow after capital investments and build the Company s cash resources. The Company calculates free cash flow by deducting cash capital spending from cash generated by operating activities. The Company does not deduct payments made for business acquisitions.

Exhibit 95 
 Mine Safety Information 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). The disclosures reflect our U.S. mining operations only as the requirements of the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K do not apply to our mines operated outside the United States. 
 Mine Safety Information. Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which a U.S. mining operator must abate the alleged violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the MSHA inspector(s) assigned. In addition to civil penalties, the Mine Act also provides for criminal penalties for an operator who willfully violates a health or safety standard or knowingly violates or fails or refuses to comply with an order issued under Section 107(a) or any final decision issued under the Act. 
 The below table reflects citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The proposed assessments for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were taken from the MSHA data retrieval system as of October 7, 2024. 
 Additional information about the Act and MSHA references used in the table follows. 
 Section 104(a) Significant and Substantial S Citations . Citations received from MSHA under section 104(a) of the Mine Act for violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard. 
 Section 104(b) Orders . Orders issued by MSHA under section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section 104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. 
 Section 104(d) S&S Citations and Orders . Citations and orders issued by MSHA under section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory, significant and substantial health or safety standards. 
 Section 110(b)(2) Violations . Flagrant violations issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 
 Section 107(a) Orders . Orders issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger (as defined by MSHA) existed. 

Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Mine Section 104(a) S&S Citations Section 104(b) Orders Section 104(d) S&S Citations and Orders Section 110(b)(2) Violations Section 107(a) Orders in thousands) Proposed MSHA Assessments Fatalities Marigold Mine (MSHA ID# 2602081) 2 0 0 0 0 (Not yet assessed) 0 
 Pattern or Potential Pattern of Violations . During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the mines operated by the Company received written notice from MSHA of (a) a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act or (b) the potential to have such a pattern. 
 Pending Legal Actions . Legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission ), an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act, may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA or complaints of discrimination by miners under section 105 of the Mine Act. The following is a brief description of the types of legal actions that may be brought before the Commission. 
 Contests of Citations and Orders . A contest proceeding may be filed with the Commission by operators, miners or miners representatives to challenge the issuance of a citation or order issued by MSHA. 
 Contests of Proposed Penalties (Petitions for Assessment of Penalties) A contest of a proposed penalty is an administrative proceeding before the Commission challenging a civil penalty that MSHA has proposed for the alleged violation contained in a citation or order. The validity of the citation may also be challenged in this proceeding as well. 
 Complaints for Compensation A complaint for compensation may be filed with the Commission by miners entitled to compensation when a mine is closed by certain withdrawal orders issued by MSHA. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation, if any, due miners idled by the orders. 
 Complaints of Discharge, Discrimination or Interference A discrimination proceeding is a case that involves a miner s allegation that he or she has suffered a wrong by the operator because he or she engaged in some type of activity protected under the Mine Act, such as making a safety complaint. 
 Applications for Temporary Relief An application for temporary relief from any modification or termination of any order or from any order issued under section 104 of the Mine Act. 
 Appeals of Judges Decisions or Orders to the Commission A filing with the Commission of a petition for discretionary review of a Judge s decision or order by a person who has been adversely affected or aggrieved by such decision or order. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the mines operated by the Company had any pending legal actions before the Commission, any legal actions instituted, or any legal actions resolved.
