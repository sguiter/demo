 Prior to the Merger, the warrants were classified as a liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, as the Company's obligation with respect to these warrants was capped at a fixed monetary amount of million and could be settled in a variable number of common shares. The Company remeasured the warrants at each balance sheet date using a hybrid method. Subsequent to the Merger, the Junior Preferred Stock Warrants were converted into the Company's common stock warrants. As a result, the Junior Preferred Stock Warrants were adjusted to fair value prior to conversion and remain classified as a liability.

The December 2023 Warrants were issued at an exercise price of per share, with a cap of extended value of million when net exercised, and without a cap when cash exercised. The December 2023 Warrants remain classified as a liability.

 Private Placement Warrants 
 
 As the accounting acquirer, Legacy Forge is deemed to have assumed warrants for Class A common stock that were held by Motive Capital Funds Sponsor, LLC (the Sponsor at an exercise price of (the "Private Placement Warrants"). The warrants are exercisable subject to the terms of the warrant agreement, including but not limited to, the Company having an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended , covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. The warrants expire after the completion of the Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. All of the Private Placement Warrants are still outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Subsequent to the Merger, the Private Placement Warrants met liability classification requirements since the warrants may be required to be settled in cash under a tender offer and are potentially subject to a different settlement amount as a result of being held by the Sponsor which precludes the Private Placement Warrants from being considered indexed to the entity's own stock. Therefore, these warrants are classified as liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets . The Company recorded gains of million and million in fair value of warrant liabilities in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and a gain of million and a loss of million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively.

The diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents during the period using the two-class method. The Company s stock options, warrants, and early exercised stock options are considered to be potential common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders because the holders of these securities do not have a contractual right to share in the Company's losses, and their effect would be antidilutive. Therefore, the net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was attributed to common stockholders only.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis provide information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes to those statements in this Report, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to those statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024 (the "Annual Report"). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, as described under the heading Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors or elsewhere in this Report. 
 
 Effective with our Annual Report filed on March 26, 2024, we have renamed a category of our revenue, previously described as Placement Fee revenue, to Marketplace revenue in order to align with the types of revenue included in this category. Marketplace revenue includes placement fees, subscription fees earned from our data products, and private company solutions revenue. We believe this name better describes the revenue included therein and therefore is more useful to investors by better characterizing the underlying types of revenue included. We have not adjusted methodology, assumptions, or otherwise changed any aspects of Placement Fee revenue in making this name change to Marketplace" revenue, and this category of revenue remains comparable to prior period presentations. 
 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to "Forge," the Company, we, us, and our, refer to Forge Global Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Key Factors Affecting our Performance 
 
 The key factors affecting our performance described below are not the only ones applicable to us. We believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon a number of key factors, including the following: 
 
 Growing our Customer Base 
 
 Our growth requires continued adoption of our platform by new customers and increased usage by current customers. We plan to continue to introduce products and features to attract and retain current and new customers, and we plan to seek to increase brand awareness and customer adoption of our platform through digital and broad-scale advertising. 
 
 Expanding our Relationship with Existing Customers 
 
 Our revenue generally grows as our customers increase their usage of our platform, as well as when we introduce new products and features to our customers. We aim to grow with our customers over time and to grow our relationship with 
 29 

Table of Contents 

our customers as they build and manage their wealth. Through our customer-centric and complementary solutions, we seek a future where sellers become buyers, buyers become custody account holders, and account holders continue to participate in the private market. Our ability to expand our relationship with our customers is therefore an important contributor to our long-term growth. 
 
 Investing in our Platform 
 
 We intend to continue to invest in our platform capabilities and regulatory and compliance functions to support new and existing customers and products that we believe will drive our growth. As our customer base and platform functionalities expand, areas of investment priority include product innovation, automation, technology and infrastructure improvements, and customer support. We believe these investments will contribute to our long-term growth. Additionally, we strive to strengthen our relationships with our customers by responding to customer feedback not only through the introduction of new products, but also through improvements to our existing products and services. In this period of market disruption, we are focused on building by improving our platform to drive down the cost and time of trading. 
 
 Market Trends 
 
 Our results of operations are impacted by the overall health of the economy and consumer and institutional investing patterns, which include the following key drivers: 
 
 Private Market Trends . Supply of and demand for private company shares fluctuates with various factors, including but not limited to, anticipated and planned IPOs, mergers and acquisitions activity in the public and private space, the level of closed and committed private company funding rounds, exits by private equity or investment firms, the number of venture and private equity backed companies participating in the private market generally, existing stockholders looking for liquidity, and demand from individual and institutional accredited investors. 
 
 Consumer Behavior . Buyers' and sellers' behaviors vary over time and are affected by numerous conditions. For example, behavior may be impacted by social or economic factors such as changes in disposable income levels and the need for liquidity, employee tenure, general interest in investing, interest rate levels, and reaction to stock market volatility. There may also be high profile IPOs, SPACs, or idiosyncratic events impacting single companies that impact consumer behavior. These shifts in consumer behavior may influence interest in our platform over time. 
 
 Macroeconomic Environment . Behavior and risk appetites by individual and institutional accredited investors, as well as businesses, are impacted by various factors in the overall macroeconomic environment, including but not limited to, the interest rate environment, volatility and liquidity risks to private equity valuations, and uncertainty around settlement prices for illiquid assets. These factors could all, individually or together, impact investor appetite and investment preferences across the alternative investment and private markets space. 
 
 Types of Structures 
 
 We have facilitated direct trades, trades in both our own special purpose vehicles (each, an "Investment Fund") and other firms funds, and certain forward agreements. We may adjust marketplace revenue to account for the operational costs of these transaction types, and we incur certain transaction-based costs depending on the structure. The mix of trades in different structures will impact our overall take rate and revenues. 
 
 Types of Buyers/Sellers 
 
 The type of customer may influence our marketplace revenue. Examples of a type of customer are institutional and individual customers, who may receive various placement fee rates depending on different factors. Having customers that come to our platform through third-party brokers or our private company solutions may also impact our marketplace revenue. The mix of customers in any given period may impact our overall take rate and revenues. 
 
 Use of Third-Party Brokers and Referral Partners 
 
 When working with a third-party broker or partner, we share a portion of the marketplace revenue, which are recognized in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under transaction-based expenses. The mix of fees 
 30 

Table of Contents 

paid to third-party brokers and partners fluctuates each time period, which we expect to continue based on the size of our order book and our number of partners, as well as changes in the market overall. 
 
 Custodial administration fees 
 
 We generate revenue from account maintenance fees, asset fees, and cash administration fees. The cash administration fees are based on prevailing interest rates and customer cash balances, and currently make up the majority of custodial administration fee revenue. With respect to the account maintenance fees, we assess a flat quarterly fee per account, with additional fees based on the number and types of assets held and the number and type of transactions executed. The account revenues depend on the number of Total Custodial Accounts, which include accounts customers open directly with us and the activity within these accounts, as well as accounts we custody on behalf of partners. Our business depends on maintaining and growing the number of Total Custodial Accounts. 
 
 Segment Information 
 
 We operate as a single operating segment and reportable segment. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance, allocating resources, and evaluating our financial performance. Accordingly, we have concluded that we consist of a single operating segment and reportable segment for accounting and financial reporting purposes. 

Key Business Metrics 
 
 We monitor the following key business metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. The tables below reflect period-over-period changes in our key business metrics, along with the percentage change between such periods. We believe the following business metrics are useful in evaluating our business.

 Trades are defined as the total number of orders executed by us and entities we have acquired on behalf of private investors and stockholder s. Increasing the number of orders is critical to increasing our revenue and, in turn, to achieving profitability. 
 
 Volume is defined as the total sales value for all securities traded through our Forge Markets platform, which is the aggregate value of the issuer company s equity attributed to both the buyer and seller in a trade and as such a 100 trade of equity between buyer and seller would be captured as 200 of volume for us. Although we typically capture a commission on each side of a trade, we may not in certain cases due to factors such as the use of a third-party broker by one of the parties or supply factors that would not allow us to attract sellers of shares of certain issuers. Volume is influenced by, among other things, the pricing and quality of our services as well as market conditions that affect private company valuations, such as increases in valuations of comparable companies at IPO. 
 
 Net Take Rates are defined as our marketplace revenues, less transaction-based expenses, divided by Volume. These represent the percentage of fees earned by our platform on any transactions executed from the commission we charged on such transactions, less transaction-based expenses, which is a determining factor in our revenue. The Net

 Total Custodial Accounts are defined as our customers custodial accounts that are established on our platform and billable. These relate to our Custodial Administration fees revenue stream and are an important measure of our business as the number of Total Custodial Accounts is an indicator of our future revenues from certain account maintenance, transaction, and cash administration fees. 
 
 Assets Under Custody is the reported value of all client holdings held under our agreements, including cash submitted to us by the responsible party. These assets can be held at various financial institutions, issuers, and in our vault. As the custodian of the accounts, we collect all interest and dividends, handle all fees and transactions, and any other considerations for the assets concerned. Our fees are earned from the overall maintenance activities of all assets and are not charged on the basis of the dollar value of Assets Under Custody, but we believe that Assets Under Custody is a useful metric for assessing the relative size and scope of our business. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), we present Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. 
 
 However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to Forge Global Holdings, Inc., adjusted to exclude: (i) net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) interest (income) expense, net, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and (vii) other significant gains, losses, and expenses such as impairments or acquisition-related transaction costs that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.

 Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include: (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. When evaluating our performance, consider Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not a substitute for, other financial performance measures, including our net loss and other GAAP results. 

Basis of Presentation 
 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report include our accounts and accounts of our consolidated subsidiaries and were prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 We generate revenue from providing private market services, which include fees charged for private placements on our platform, and fees charged for account and asset management to customers. 
 
 We categorize our services into the following categories: 
 
 Marketplace revenue We maintain a platform which generates revenues through our Forge Markets offering with volume-based fees sourced from institutions, individual investors, and private equity holders. Marketplace revenue represents fees charged by us for executing a private placement on our platform. We earn agency marketplace revenue in non-underwritten transactions, such as private placements of equity securities. We receive marketplace revenue on these transactions and believe that our trade execution performance obligation is completed upon the placement and consummation of a transaction and, as such, revenue is earned on the transaction date with no further obligation to the customer at that time. We enter into arrangements with individual accredited customers or Investment Funds to execute private placements in the secondary market. Revenues generated from our data solutions are classified as part of marketplace revenue in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations (see Subscription Fees below). 
 
 Custodial administration fee s We generate revenue from account maintenance fees, asset fees, transaction fees, and cash administration fees. The cash administration fees are based on prevailing interest rates and customer cash balances, and currently make up the majority of custodial administration fee revenue. With respect to the account maintenance fees, we 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 assess a flat quarterly fee per account, with additional fees based on the number and types of assets held and the number and type of transactions executed. The account revenues depend on the number of Total Custodial Accounts, which include accounts customers opened directly with us and the activity within these accounts as well as accounts we custody on behalf of partners. Revenues from custodial administration fees are recognized either over time as underlying performance obligations are met and day-to-day maintenance activities are performed for custodial accounts, or at a point in time upon completion of transactions requested by custodial account holders. 
 
 Subscription Fees We generate revenues through our Forge Data offerings with subscription fees earned from our data products, including Forge Intelligence and Forge Pro, and subscription fees earned from our private company solutions . Subscription fees for the periods presented were included as part of marketplace revenue in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations . 
 
 Transaction-based expenses 
 
 Transaction-based expenses represent fees incurred to support placement activities. These include, but are not limited to, third-party broker fees, transfer fees, fund management, and fund and trade settlement . 
 
 Compensation and benefits 
 
 Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, share-based compensation, severance costs, benefits, and employer taxes. The incentive component of our compensation and benefits expense consists of amounts paid on the achievement of sales targets and discretionary bonuses, which are based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. 
 
 Professional services 
 
 Professional services expense includes fees for accounting, tax, auditing, consulting, and legal. 
 
 Advertising and market development 
 
 Advertising and market development is an important driver of our value and we intend to continue making meaningful investments in the Forge brand and growth marketing. This includes brand advertising, thought leadership, content marketing, public relations, partnerships, and other strategies that amplify our brand. We have a rigorous approach to measuring customer lifetime value and optimizing our customer acquisition investments according to market dynamics and effective return on investment ("ROI"). We manage our discretionary expenses in growth marketing in real-time, as audience-specific dynamics show positive ROI. 
 
 Rent and occupancy 
 
 Rent and occupancy expense is related to our leased property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, and other related c osts. 
 
 Technology and communications 
 
 Technology and communications consist of costs for our hosting fees paid to third-party data centers, software subscriptions, software development engineers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. Technology and communications also include costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunicatio ns. 
 
 General and administrative 
 
 General and administrative includes corporate insurance, travel and entertainment, reserves for contingent losses, including allowances for bad debts and legal proceedings, and other general and administrative costs . 
 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 Depreciation and amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization is attributable to property and equipment, intangible assets, and capitalized internal-use software. 
 
 Interest income 
 
 Interest income primarily includes interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and term deposits. 
 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
 
 Changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities are related to warrant liabilities that are marked-to-market each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations until the warrants are exercised, expire, or other facts and circumstances that could lead the warrant liabilities to be reclassified to stockholders equity occur. 
 
 Other income (expenses), net 
 
 Other income (expenses), net, includes other non-operating income and expenditures and sublease income. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 Income tax expense consists of federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities, with the exception of certain indefinite-lived liabilities, as we have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets.

 Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, decreased 2.9 million, or 13 . 
 
 Marketplace revenue decreased 3.0 million, or 25 , driven by a 21 decrease in volume along with a 10 basis point decrease in net take rate to 2.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . Third quarter transactional volume is historically influenced by seasonal investment behavior in the summer months. Net take rate in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower due to large block transactions executed at lower net take rates. 
 
 Custodial administration fees decreased by 0.1 million, or 1 . Average cash deposits were down slightly in the three months ended September 30, 2024, with slightly lower interest rates leading to lower revenue for cash administration services. Total custodial accounts increased 3 , to 2,281,976 , as of September 30, 2024.

 Other operating expenses increased 0.4 million, or 4 . 
 
 Other operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to the timing of certain accounting services and legal matters, recorded in professional services, and increased software development expense, recorded in technology and communications. These increases were partially offset by lower travel related expenses, recorded in general and administrative, and timing driven reductions in advertising and market development costs. 
 
 Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Other operating expenses decreased 2.4 million, or 6 . 
 
 Other operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , include certain non-recurring charges, including 2.8 million related to litigation accruals, recorded in general and administrative expenses, and an impairment of 0.2 million in connection with the Company's right-of-use asset, recorded in rent and occupancy expense. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 include certain non-recurring charges, including 1.5 million related to litigation accruals and capitalized software impairment losses of 0.5 million, recorded in general and administrative expenses . Cost containment efforts resulted in decreases of 2.6 million in professional services, 1.6 million in third-party software engineer expense, recorded in technology and communication expense, 0.5 million in rent expense, recorded in rent and occupancy expense, from rationalization of the Company's office space needs, and 1.1 million in company liability insurance costs, recorded in general and administrative expense. These savings were partially offset by increases in advertising and market development expenses and travel costs, recorded in general and administrative expense, as the Company moves to a hybrid workplace and more in-office activities .

 Total interest and other income (expenses) decreased 1.5 million, or 39 , primarily from the change of 1.3 million in the fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities are primarily driven by changes in the closing price of the Company's stock on the valuation date and the stock price volatility assumption. Declining interest income is the result of lower average cash balances. 
 
 Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Total interest and other income (expenses) increased 10.0 million, primarily from the favorable change of 10.4 million in the fair value of warrant liabilities. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 To date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from operations, issuances of securities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from the Business Combination. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, and investments in business acquisitions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents balance of 114.5 million . Since our inception, we have generated operating losses as reflected in our accumulated deficit. We had an accumulated deficit of 331.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months from the date of this Report . Our future financing and capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development of our platform, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Although we currently are not a party to any agreement and do not have any understanding with any third parties with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, businesses or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. 
 
 We intend to continue to make investments in product development, sales efforts, and additional general and administrative costs. We expect to continue to maintain financing flexibility in the current market conditions. As a result, we may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business. 
 
 We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.

Non-cash charges primarily consisted of share-based compensation of 24.9 million , a decrease in the fair value of warrant liabilities of 7.7 million, and depreciation and amortization of 5.3 million . The main driver of the cash outflows from the changes in operating assets and liabilities was related to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 2.2 million attributable to payment of annual corporate insurance premiums and legal defense costs recoverable under an indemnification claim and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 1.8 million. 
 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 34.9 million was primarily related to our net loss of 65.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 36.8 million, and net cash outflows of 6.4 million related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of share-based compensation of 25.4 million, depreciation and amortization of 5.2 million, and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 2.7 million.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our audited annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider forming a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in our business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our audited annual consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements . 
 
 On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions relate to the critical accounting policies. 
 
 There h ave been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those described in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in our Annual Report. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See the section titled "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Note 2 of our Annual Report. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Information regarding legal proceedings is available in Note 8, "Commitments and Contingencies", to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described in the section titled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report, other than as set forth below. 
 
 Changes and complexities in tax laws, incomplete filings, differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and proposed legislation that would impose taxes on certain financial transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We operate in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. governments. U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) and to varying interpretations. U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest, or penalties that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, future changes to U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. 
 
 In addition, we are required to file extensive informational returns and forms to various tax authorities in connection with our custodial and trading solutions. If such filings are incomplete or untimely, we may be subjected to fines or penalties if we do not meet the requirements of reasonable cause, safe harbor, or other relief as may be provided by the relevant tax authorities. In October 2024, we self-identified a failure to submit certain informational filings to the Internal Revenue Service IRS in connection with our custodial solutions. At this time, we are unable to determine if we will be subject to any fines or penalties due to these incomplete filings, the amount of any potential fines or penalties, and whether such amount, if any, could materially affect our financial condition and operations. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act IRA was enacted in the United States, which introduced, among other provisions, a new minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations, an excise tax of 1 on certain share repurchases by corporations, and increased funding for the IRS. Both the minimum corporate income tax and share repurchase excise tax do not currently apply to us, nor do we expect them to apply to us in the foreseeable future. However, changes in our business and any future regulations or other guidance on the interpretation and application of these provisions, may result in additional taxes payable by us, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results and operations. 
 
 We have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, significant valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, which may have a material impact on our results of operations and cause fluctuations in such results. As of December 31, 2023, we had a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the United States and in other countries. Our net deferred tax assets relate predominantly to the U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions. The need for a valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In making such an assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. We continue to monitor the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets in the future. Future adjustments in our valuation allowance may be required. The recording of any future increases in our valuation allowance could have a material impact on our reported results, and both the recording and release of the valuation allowance could cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. 
 
 In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership as well as other changes that may be outside

 of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. Further, additional changes to federal or state tax laws or technical guidance relating to such laws that would further reduce the corporate tax rate could operate to effectively reduce or eliminate the value of any deferred tax asset. Our tax attributes as of December 31, 2023 may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.

The Company and Releasees expressly deny any liability or alleged violation of any law, contract or applicable policy. 
 
 14. Older Worker Benefit Protection Act Disclosure . Executive recognizes that as part of Executive s agreement to release any and all claims against the Releasees, Executive is releasing claims for age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Accordingly, Executive has been afforded more than twenty-one (21) days from the date Executive received this Agreement to review this Agreement (the Review Period and Executive has an additional period of seven (7) days after executing this Agreement to revoke it in writing to the Company under the terms of the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act.

If timely signed, dated and returned to the Company and not revoked prior to the end of the seven (7) day revocation period, this Agreement shall be effective upon the expiration of the seven (7) day revocation period (the Effective Date ). By Executive s signature below, Executive represents and warrants that Executive has been advised to consult with an attorney of Executive s own choosing, that Executive has been given a reasonable amount of time to consider this Agreement, and that Executive is voluntarily and knowingly waiving any right he could possibly claim to review the Agreement for an additional period of time.

 16. Section 409A . As applicable, the parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code. Each payment pursuant to this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A2(b)(2). The parties agree that this Agreement may 

be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section. 
 
 17. Governing Law . This Separation Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

If, moreover, any one or more of the provisions (or portions thereof) contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it is excessively broad as to duration or scope of prohibited activities, it shall be (to the extent permitted by law) construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to extend and be enforced only over the maximum duration and scope of activities as to which it may be enforceable under applicable law. 
 
 21. Modification . This Agreement may be modified or amended only by a written instrument duly signed by each of the parties hereto or their respective successors or assigns. The parties rights and obligations hereunder shall survive this Agreement becoming effective and Executive s termination of employment in accordance with their respective terms.
