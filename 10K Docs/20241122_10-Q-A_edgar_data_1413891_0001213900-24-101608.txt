Notes to
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 

June 30,
2024 

. The Company is a global provider of managed cybersecurity and managed networks delivered exclusively through a channel sales
model. The Company s Overwatch managed security platform-as-a-service offers organizations end-to-end protection for networks,
data, endpoints and users via multiyear recurring revenue contracts in this fast-growing technology segment. 

HWN

legally changed its name to High Wire Networks, Inc. High Wire or, collectively with HWN, the Company ).
The merger was accounted for as a reverse merger. At the time of the reverse merger, High Wire s subsidiaries included ADEX Corporation,
ADEX Puerto Rico LLC, ADEX Canada, ADEX Towers, Inc. and ADEX Telecom, Inc. (collectively ADEX or the ADEX Entities ),
AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC AWS PR ), and Tropical Communications, Inc. Tropical ). For accounting purposes,
HWN is the surviving entity. 

High
Wire was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 22, 2007 to acquire and commercially exploit various new energy related technologies
through licenses and purchases. On December 8, 2008, High Wire reincorporated in the province of British Columbia, Canada. 

On
November 4, 2021, the Company closed on its acquisition of Secure Voice Corp SVC ). The closing of the acquisition was
facilitated by a senior secured promissory note. 

On
February 15, 2022, HWN sold its interest in JTM, which qualified for discontinued operations treatment. 

On
March 6, 2023, HWN divested the ADEX Entities. The divestiture of the ADEX Entities qualified for discontinued operations treatment (refer
to Note 18, Discontinued Operations, for additional detail). 

On
July 31, 2023, the Company paused the operations of its AWS PR subsidiary and sold off certain assets. 

On
August 4, 2023, the Company formed a new entity incorporated as Overwatch Cyberlab, Inc. OCL which is
 owned by the Company and owned by John Peterson. 

On
November 3, 2023, the Company paused the operations of its Tropical subsidiary. 

On June 27, 2024, HWN entered into an asset purchase agreement with
INNO4 LLC (the Buyer pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to purchase certain assets of HWN related to the Company s
technology services business unit (refer to Note 3, Recent Subsidiary Activity, for additional detail). The assets related to the technology
services business unit qualified for discontinued operations treatment. Additionally, the asset purchase agreement includes a non-compete
which precludes the Company from operating businesses similar to that of AWS PR and Tropical. As a result, both subsidiaries also now
qualify for discontinued operations treatment. (refer to Note 18, Discontinued Operations, for additional detail). 

The Company s SVC subsidiary
is a wholesale network services provider with network footprint and licenses in the Northeast and Southeast United States as well as Texas.
This network carries VoIP and other traffic for other service providers.

The Company considered whether
or not this transaction would cause the sold assets to qualify for discontinued operations treatment. The Company determined that the
sale of the assets qualifies for discontinued operations treatment as of June 30, 2024 due to the size of their operations and because

Additionally, the asset purchase
agreement includes a non-compete which precludes the Company from operating businesses similar to that of AWS PR and Tropical. As a result,
both subsidiaries also now qualify for discontinued operations treatment as of June 30, 2024 (refer to Note 18, Discontinued Operations,
for additional detail). The operations of AWS PR and Tropical had net loss and net income of and , respectively, during the

Description of Business 

Business Overview 

HWN, Inc., (d/b/a High Wire

organizations end-to-end protection for networks, data, endpoints and users via multiyear recurring revenue contracts in this fast-growing
technology segment. HWN has continuously operated under the High Wire Networks brand for more than 20 years. 

HWN and JTM Electrical Contractors,
Inc. JTM ), an Illinois Corporation, entered into an operating agreement through which High Wire owned 50 of JTM. On February
15, 2022, HWN sold its 50 interest in JTM. 

On June 16, 2021, we completed
a merger with Spectrum Global Solutions, Inc. On January 7, 2022, Spectrum Global Solutions, Inc. legally changed its name to High Wire
Networks, Inc. High Wire ). The merger was accounted for as a reverse merger. At the time of the reverse merger, High Wire s
subsidiaries included ADEX Corporation, ADEX Puerto Rico LLC, ADEX Canada, ADEX Towers, Inc. and ADEX Telecom, Inc. (collectively ADEX 
or the ADEX Entities ), AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC AWS PR ), and Tropical Communications, Inc. Tropical ).
For accounting purposes, HWN is the surviving entity. On March 6, 2023, HWN divested the ADEX Entities. On July 31, 2023, HWN paused the
operations of its AWS PR subsidiary. On November 3, 2023, HWN paused the operations of its Tropical subsidiary. 

On November 4, 2021, we closed
on the acquisition of Secure Voice Corp SVC ). The closing of the acquisition was facilitated by a senior secured promissory
note which has been repaid. 

On August 4, 2023, we formed
a new entity incorporated as Overwatch Cyberlab, Inc. OCL which is 80 owned by our company and 20 owned
by John Peterson.

On June 27, 2024, HWN entered into an asset purchase agreement with
INNO4 LLC pursuant to which INNO4 LLC agreed to purchase certain assets of HWN related to our technology services business unit. Additionally,
the asset purchase agreement includes a non-compete which precludes our company from operating businesses similar to that of AWS PR and
Tropical.

Revenues 

Our revenue increased from
 3,648,640 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to 3,999,121 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 350,481. Additionally,
there was an improvement in gross profit (revenue minus cost of revenue) of 709,233. The improvement in the gross profit as a percentage
of revenue from 28 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to 43 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily related to an improvement
in more cost-efficient software provider contracts as well as efficiencies resultant in a larger install base.. 

A
significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for
periods of one or more years. We are currently party to numerous master service agreements with our channel partner managed service providers MSPs ). Most MSPs have multiple sub-agreements with us supporting their end-customer base. Contract terms with MSPs are
typically three-year agreements. 

Operating Expenses 

During the six months
ended June 30, 2024, our operating expenses were 8,530,160, compared to 8,428,140 for the same period of 2023. The increase of 102,020
is primarily related to a 1,463,006 increase in salaries and wages due to increasing personnel costs as we increase investment in our
cybersecurity business, as well as bonuses related to meeting certain strategic objectives. This increase was partially offset by a decrease
of 1,008,205 in general and administrative expenses due to certain cost cutting measures. 

41 

Other (Expense) Income 

During the six months
ended June 30, 2024, we had other expense of 1,521,467, compared to other income of 2,214,662 for the same period of 2023. The change
of 3,736,129 is primarily related to a gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 3,140,404 and a gain on extinguishment
of derivatives of 1,692,232 during the 2023 period, along with a loss on settlement of debt of 467,060 in the 2024 period. These changes
were partially offset by one time liquidated damages related to escrow shares of 1,222,000 in the 2023 period along with a gain on extinguishment
of warrant liabilities of 921,422 and a gain on settlement of debt of 219,330 during the 2024 period.

on sale of business unit of 7,950,773, and other income of 1,500, while the 2023 period included income from operations of 26,467,
the loss on disposal of subsidiary of 1,434,392, and an exchange loss of 923.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

capital deficit of 3,830,302, compared to a working capital deficit of 9,915,819 as of December 31, 2023. 

We
have historically suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and
maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard, we have historically raised additional capital
through equity offerings and loan transactions.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting
company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on management s
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, as of June 30, 2024, our
disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The material
weaknesses, which relate to internal control over financial reporting, that were identified are: 

a) Due
to our small size, we do not have a proper segregation of duties in certain areas of our financial reporting process. The areas where
we have a lack of segregation of duties include cash receipts and disbursements, approval of purchases and approval of accounts payable
invoices for payment. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements
of the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis; 

b) we
do not have any formally adopted internal controls surrounding our cash and financial reporting procedures; and 

c) the
lack of the quantity of resources to implement an appropriate level of review controls to properly evaluate the completeness and accuracy
of transactions entered into by our company. 

We are committed to improving
our financial organization. In addition, we will look to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the
accounting function to resolve non-routine or complex accounting matters. 

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting. 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

43 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject
to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We
are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting
company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
