The Fund issues shares (the Shares ), which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in the Fund. The Shares of the Fund are listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. or the Exchange ). 
 The Fund seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin. The Fund seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Fund s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in bitcoin rather than by acquiring, holding, and trading bitcoin directly on a peer-to-peer

 or other basis or via a digital asset platform. The Fund is a passive investment vehicle and is not a leveraged product. The Sponsor does not actively manage the bitcoin held by the Fund. 
 The Bank of New York Mellon BNYM serves as the Fund s Administrator, Transfer Agent and the Cash Custodian. The Administrator is generally responsible for the day-to-day

per annum in ordinary legal fees and expenses. The Sponsor will also pay the costs of the Fund s organization and the initial offering costs and may not seek reimbursement of such costs. 
 The Sponsor s fee is accrued daily at an annualized rate equal to of the net asset value of the Fund and is payable at least quarterly in arrears in U.S. dollars. The Sponsor may, at its sole discretion and from time to time, waive all or a portion of the Sponsor s fee for stated periods of time. The Sponsor is under no obligation to waive any portion of its fees and any such waiver shall create no obligation to waive any such fees during any period not covered by the waiver. The Fund will sell bitcoin as needed to pay the Sponsor s fee. The Fund bears transaction costs, including any bitcoin network fees or other similar transaction fees, in connection with any sales of bitcoin necessary to pay the Sponsor s fee, as well as other Fund expenses (if any) that are not assumed by the Sponsor (expenses assumed by the Sponsor are specified above). Any bitcoin network fees and similar transaction fees incurred in connection with the creation or redemption of Creation Units are borne by the Authorized Participant. For a period from January 12, 2024 to August 2, 2024, the Sponsor waived the entire Sponsor s fee on the first billion of the Fund s assets. Prior to the implementation of the waiver, for the one day period January 11, 2024, the Fund accrued the Sponsor fee of ). For the period April 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, the Fund accrued the Sponsor s Fee of ) less waiver and reimbursement of , the net Sponsor s Fee post waiver and reimbursement is . 
 The Sponsor is not required to pay any extraordinary or non-routine
 expenses. Extraordinary expenses are fees and expenses which are unexpected or unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs or indemnification or other unanticipated expenses. Extraordinary fees and expenses also include material expenses which are not currently anticipated obligations of the Fund. The Fund will be responsible for the payment of such expenses to the extent any such expenses are incurred. Routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses are not deemed extraordinary expenses. In addition, the Fund may incur certain other non-recurring
 expenses that are not assumed by the Sponsor (expenses assumed by the Sponsor are described above), including but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, any applicable brokerage commissions, bitcoin network fees and similar transaction fees that qualify as extraordinary or non-routine
 expenses as described above, financing fees, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Fund to protect the Fund or the interests of Shareholders (including, for example, in connection with any fork of the bitcoin blockchain, any Incidental Rights and any IR Virtual Currency), any indemnification of the Cash Custodian, Bitcoin Custodian, Prime Broker, Administrator or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust or the Fund and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters or legal expenses in excess of per year. The Sponsor may determine in its sole discretion to assume legal fees and expenses of the Fund in excess of the per annum stipulated in the Sponsor Agreement. To the extent that the Sponsor does not voluntarily assume such fees and expenses, they will be the responsibility of the Fund. The Fund s organizational and offering costs are borne by the Sponsor and, as such, are the sole responsibility of the Sponsor. The Sponsor will not seek reimbursement or otherwise require the Fund, the Trust, the Trustee, or any Shareholder to assume any liability, duty or obligation in connection with any such organizational and offering costs. Because the Fund does not have any income, it will need to sell bitcoin to cover the Sponsor s fee and expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, if any. Fund expenses not assumed by the Sponsor shall accrue daily and be payable by the Fund to the Sponsor at least quarterly in arrears. The Fund may also be subject to other liabilities (for example, as a result of litigation) that have also not been assumed by the Sponsor. The only source of funds to cover those liabilities will be sales of bitcoin held by the Fund. Even if there are no expenses other than those assumed by the Sponsor, and there are no other liabilities of the Fund, the Fund will still need to sell bitcoin to pay the Sponsor s fee. The result of these sales is a decrease in the amount of bitcoin represented by each Share. 
 There have been no extraordinary or non-routine
 expenses during the periods presented. 
 To cover the Sponsor s fee and expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, the Sponsor or its delegate will cause the Fund to convert bitcoin into U.S. dollars generally at the price available through the Prime Broker s Coinbase Prime service (less applicable trading fees) through the Trading Platform which the Sponsor is able to obtain using commercially reasonable efforts. The number of bitcoins represented by a Share will decline each time the Fund pays the Sponsor s fee or any Fund expenses not assumed by the Sponsor by transferring or selling bitcoins. The quantity of bitcoins to be sold to permit payment of the Sponsor s fee or Fund expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Fund s expenses and the value of bitcoins held by the Fund.

The Fund bears transaction costs, including any bitcoin network fees or other similar transaction fees, in connection with any sales of bitcoin necessary to pay the Sponsor s fee, as well as other Fund expenses (if any) that are not assumed by the Sponsor (expenses assumed by the Sponsor are specified above).

The result of these sales is a decrease in the amount of bitcoin represented by each Share. 
 There have been no extraordinary or non-routine
 expenses during the periods presented. 
 To cover the Sponsor s fee and expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, the Sponsor or its delegate will cause the Fund to convert bitcoin into U.S. dollars generally at the price available through the Prime Broker s Coinbase Prime service (less applicable trading fees) through the Trading Platform which the Sponsor is able to obtain using commercially reasonable efforts. The number of bitcoins represented by a Share will decline each time the Fund pays the Sponsor s fee or any Fund expenses not assumed by the Sponsor by transferring or selling bitcoins. The quantity of bitcoins to be sold to permit payment of the Sponsor s fee or Fund expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Fund s expenses and the value of bitcoins held by the Fund.

The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Fund s as well as the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Fund s as well as the Trust s application of accounting policies.
