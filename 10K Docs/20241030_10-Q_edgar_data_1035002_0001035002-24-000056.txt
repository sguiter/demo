California refineries and the manner in which we expect to address the potential impacts on feedstock and product inventories in California as a result of such turnaround and maintenance activities. The provisions of SBx 1-2 became effective June 26, 2023. 
 
 In September 2023, Governor Newsom directed the CEC to immediately begin the regulatory processes concerning the potential imposition of a penalty for exceeding a max margin and the timing of refinery turnarounds and maintenance. Consequently, in October 2023, the CEC adopted an order instituting an informational proceeding on a max margin and penalty under SBx 1-2, as well as an order initiating rulemaking activity under SBx 1-2. In May 2024, the CEC issued resolutions adopting emergency regulations implementing new and expanded refining margin, refinery maintenance, and marine import reporting requirements, all of which became effective in June 2024. It remains uncertain as to what extent any regulations will address the remaining reporting requirements under SBx 1-2. In September 2024, the CEC held a workshop to explore structures for determining a potential max margin and penalty; however, it remains uncertain whether and when the CEC will decide to set a max margin and penalty.

 As of September 30, 2024, the significant consolidated VIEs included: 
 
 DGD, a joint venture with a subsidiary of Darling Ingredients Inc. that owns and operates plants that process waste and renewable feedstocks (predominantly animal fats, used cooking oils, vegetable oils, and inedible distillers corn oils) into renewable diesel and renewable naphtha; and 
 
 Central Mexico Terminals, a collective group of subsidiaries of Infraestructura Energetica Nova, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (IEnova), which is a Mexican company and indirect subsidiary of Sempra Energy, a U.S. public company. We have terminaling agreements with Central Mexico Terminals that represent variable interests. We do not have an ownership interest in Central Mexico Terminals. 
 
 The assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle their own obligations and the creditors of the consolidated VIEs have no recourse to our other assets. We generally do not provide financial guarantees to the VIEs. Although we have provided credit facilities to some of the VIEs in support of their construction or acquisition activities, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are impacted by the performance of the consolidated VIEs, net of intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in each VIE.

 Contract liabilities, included in accrued expenses 
 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 We have spot and term contracts with customers, the majority of which are spot contracts with no remaining performance obligations. We do not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts that have terms of one year or less. The transaction price for our remaining term contracts includes a fixed component and variable consideration (i.e., a commodity price), both of which are allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good that forms part of a single performance obligation. The fixed component is not material and the variable consideration is highly uncertain. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, we have not disclosed the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations. 
 
 Segment Information 
 We have reportable segments Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol. Each segment is a strategic business unit that offers different products and services by employing unique technologies and marketing strategies and whose operations and operating performance are managed and evaluated separately. Operating performance is measured based on the operating income generated by the segment, which includes revenues and expenses that are directly attributable to the management of the respective segment. Intersegment sales are generally derived from transactions made at prevailing market rates. The following is a description of each segment s business operations. 
 
 The Refining segment includes the operations of our petroleum refineries, the associated activities to market our refined petroleum products, and the logistics assets that support our refining operations. The principal products manufactured by our refineries and sold by this segment include gasolines and blendstocks, distillates, and other products. 
 
 The Renewable Diesel segment represents the operations of DGD, a consolidated joint venture as discussed in Note 6, and the associated activities to market renewable diesel and renewable naphtha. The principal products manufactured by DGD and sold by this segment are renewable diesel and renewable naphtha. This segment sells some renewable diesel to the Refining segment, which is then sold to that segment s customers.

 Changes in current assets and current liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the following: 
 
 The decrease in receivables was due to a decrease in refined petroleum product sales volumes combined with a decrease in related prices in September 2024 compared to December 2023; 
 
 The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower inventory levels in September 2024 compared to December 2023; and 
 The decrease in accounts payable was due to a decrease in crude oil and other feedstock prices combined with a decrease in related volumes purchased in September 2024 compared to December 2023. 
 
 Changes in current assets and cu rrent liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to the following: 
 
 The increase in receivables was due to an increase in refined petroleum product prices in September 2023 compared to December 2022; 
 The increase in inventories was due to an increase in inventory volumes in September 2023 compared to December 2022; 
 The increase in accounts payable was due to an increase in crude oil and other feedstock prices in September 2023 compared to December 2022; and 
 The decrease in income taxes payable was primarily due to income tax payments made during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 A description of our assets and liabilities recognized at fair value along with the valuation methods and inputs we used to develop their fair value measurements are as follows: 
 
 Commodity derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures, which are used to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows as discussed in Note 12. These contracts are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Physical purchase contracts represent the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts. The fair values of these purchase contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange or an independent pricing service and are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Blending program obligations represent our liability for the purchase of compliance credits needed to satisfy our blending obligations under various government and regulatory blending programs, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency s (EPA) Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), the Canada Clean Fuel Regulations, and similar programs in other jurisdictions in which we operate (collectively, the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs). The blending program obligations are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from an independent pricing service.

Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of feedstocks (primarily crude oil, waste and renewable feedstocks, and corn); the products we produce; and natural gas and electricity used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, such as futures and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that is periodically reviewed with our Board and/or relevant Board committee. 
 
 We primarily use commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges and economic hedges. Our objectives for entering into each type of hedge is described below. 
 
 Cash flow hedges The objective of our cash flow hedges is to lock in the price of forecasted purchases and/or product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable. 
 
 Economic hedges Our objectives for holding economic hedges are to (i) manage price volatility in certain feedstock and product inventories and (ii) lock in the price of forecasted purchases and/or product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable.

 Futures long Futures short Options long Options short Corn: Futures long Futures short Physical contracts long 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our foreign operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of our operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we often use foreign currency contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and therefore are classified as economic hedges. As of September 30, 2024, we had foreign currency contracts to purchase million of U.S. dollars. All of these commitments matured on or before October 25, 2024. 
 
 Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. The Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs require us to blend a certain volume of renewable and low-carbon fuels into the petroleum-based transportation fuels we produce in, or import into, the respective jurisdiction to be consumed therein based on annual quotas. To the degree we are unable to blend at the required quotas, we must purchase compliance credits (primarily Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs)). The cost of meeting our credit obligations under the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million

Market Risk 
 Our price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, which is the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies that are periodically reviewed with our Board and/or relevant Board committee. Market risks are monitored by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy. We also do not have any derivative instruments that require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit rating.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 The following discussions in OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, and LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES include references to financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable); Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin; and capital investments attributable to Valero. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods, to help assess our cash flows, and because we believe they provide useful information as discussed further below. See the tables in note (a) beginning on page 55 for reconciliations of adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable) and Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also in note (a), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of such non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. See the table on page 61 for a reconciliation of capital investments attributable to Valero to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Beginning on page 60 , we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information. 

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK 

Overview 
 Business Operations Update 
 Our results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were supported by the continued strong worldwide demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels, while the worldwide supply of those products remained constrained. Our results for the third quarter, however, were also impacted by lower product margins and heavy maintenance activities. 
 
 We reported 364 million and 2.5 billion of net income attributable to Valero stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024, respectively. Our operating results, including operating results by segment, are described in the following summary under Third Quarter Results and First Nine Months Results, and detailed descriptions can be found under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS beginning on page 42 . 
 
 Our operations generated 5.6 billion of cash during the first nine months of 2024. This cash, along with cash on hand, was used to make 1.5 billion of capital investments in our business and return 3.7 billion to our stockholders through purchases of common stock for treasury and dividend payments. In addition, we reduced our outstanding debt during the first nine months of 2024 through the repayment of the 167 million outstanding principal balance of our 1.200 percent Senior Notes that matured in March 2024. As a result of this and other activity, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased by 70 million during the first nine months of 2024 to 5.4 billion as of September 30, 2024. We had 10.3 billion in liquidity as of September 30, 2024. The components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows, capital investments, and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources can be found under LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES beginning on page 58 .

 Third Quarter Results 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of 364 million compared to 2.6 billion for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease of 2.3 billion was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of 3.0 billion, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of 717 million. The details of our operating income and adjusted operating income by segment and in total are reflected below (in millions). Adjusted operating income excludes the adjustment reflected in the tables in note (a) beginning on page 55 . 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Refining segment: Operating income 565 3,445 (2,880) Adjusted operating income 568 3,451 (2,883) Renewable Diesel segment: Operating income 35 123 (88) Ethanol segment: Operating income 153 197 (44) Total company: Operating income 507 3,503 (2,996) Adjusted operating income 510 3,509 (2,999) 
 
 While our operating income decreased by 3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, adjusted operating income also decreased by 3.0 billion primarily due to the following: 
 
 Refining segment . Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by 2.9 billion primarily due to lower gasoline and distillate (primarily diesel) margins and a decline in crude oil differentials, partially offset by higher margins on other products and lower operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense). 
 
 Renewable Diesel segment. Renewable Diesel segment operating income decreased by 88 million primarily due to lower product prices (primarily renewable diesel), partially offset by lower feedstock costs and an increase in sales volumes. 
 
 Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment operating income decreased by 44 million primarily due to lower ethanol and corn related co-product prices, partially offset by lower corn prices and an increase in production volumes.

 First Nine Months Results 
 For the first nine months of 2024, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of 2.5 billion compared to 7.6 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease of 5.1 billion was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of 6.9 billion, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of 1.6 billion. The details of our operating income and adjusted operating income by segment and in total are reflected below (in millions). Adjusted operating income excludes the adjustment reflected in the tables in note (a) beginning on page 55 . 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Refining segment: Operating income 3,534 9,934 (6,400) Adjusted operating income 3,547 9,951 (6,404) Renewable Diesel segment: Operating income 337 768 (431) Ethanol segment: Operating income 268 363 (95) Adjusted operating income 295 364 (69) Total company: Operating income 3,407 10,305 (6,898) Adjusted operating income 3,447 10,323 (6,876) 
 
 While our operating income decreased by 6.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, adjusted operating income also decreased by 6.9 billion primarily due to the following: 
 
 Refining segment. Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by 6.4 billion primarily due to lower gasoline and distillate (primarily diesel) margins, a decline in crude oil differentials, and a decrease in throughput volumes, partially offset by lower operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense). 
 
 Renewable Diesel segment. Renewable Diesel segment operating income decreased by 431 million primarily due to lower product prices (primarily renewable diesel), partially offset by lower feedstock costs and an increase in sales volumes. 
 
 Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by 69 million primarily due to lower ethanol and corn related co-product prices, partially offset by lower corn prices and an increase in production volumes.

 Outlook 
 Many uncertainties remain with respect to the supply and demand balances in petroleum-based product markets worldwide. While it is difficult to predict future worldwide economic activity and its impact on product supply and demand, as well as any effect that the uncertainty described in Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements or other political or regulatory developments may have on us, we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Gasoline and diesel demand have exceeded pre-pandemic levels and are expected to follow typical seasonal patterns. Jet fuel demand continues to improve and is approaching pre-pandemic levels in the U.S. 
 
 Combined light product (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) inventories in the U.S. and Europe are expected to remain comparable to recent historical levels. 
 
 Crude oil differentials are expected to remain relatively stable as a result of increased availability of sour crude oils from Latin America and the potential increase in production by OPEC+ suppliers. However, potential sanction adjustments related to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and conflict in the Middle East, including impacts on shipping routes and freight costs, could result in increased volatility in the crude oil market and potentially impact crude oil differentials. 
 Renewable diesel demand is expected to remain consistent with current levels. 
 Ethanol demand is expected to follow typical seasonal patterns.

 96 813 (717) 
 
 Revenues decreased by 5.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to decreases in product prices for the petroleum-based transportation fuels associated with sales made by our Refining segment. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales of 2.5 billion primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs. These changes resulted in a 3.0 billion decrease in operating income, from 3.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to 507 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Adjusted operating income also decreased by 3.0 billion, from 3.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to 510 million in the third quarter of 2024. The components of this 3.0 billion decrease in adjusted operating income are discussed by segment in the segment analyses that follow. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased by 717 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense.

The RVO cost is calculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class of renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the quotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels consumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding together the results of each calculation. 
 
 (c) We use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the Refining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who operate facilities similar to those included in our segments. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our Liquidity 
 Our liquidity consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 (in millions): 
 Available capacity from our committed facilities (a): Valero Revolver 3,998 Accounts receivable sales facility 1,300 Total available capacity 5,298 Cash and cash equivalents (b) 4,966 Total liquidity 
 10,264 
 ________________________ 
 (a) Excludes the committed facilities of the consolidated VIEs. 
 (b) Excludes 218 million of cash and cash equivalents related to the consolidated VIEs that is for their use only. 
 
 Information about our outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 We believe we have sufficient funds from operations and from available capacity under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments over the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional cash through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.

 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we used the 5.6 billion of cash generated by our operations, 5.5 billion in debt borrowings, and 70 million of cash on hand to make 1.4 billion of investments in our business, repay 6.1 billion of debt and finance lease obligations, and return 3.7 billion to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments. The debt borrowings and repayments are described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 As previously noted, our operations generated 5.6 billion of cash in the first nine months of 2024, driven primarily by net income of 2.6 billion, noncash charges to income of 2.2 billion, and a positive change in working capital of 795 million. Noncash charges primarily included 2.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 10 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for an analysis of the significant components of our net income. 
 
 Our investing activities of 1.4 billion primarily consisted of 1.5 billion in capital investments, as defined on the following page under Capital Investments, of which 260 million related to capital investments made by DGD. 
 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 In the first nine months of 2023, we used the 8.0 billion of cash generated by our operations and the 2.3 billion in debt borrowings to make 1.4 billion of investments in our business, repay 2.6 billion of debt and finance lease obligations (including premiums paid on the early retirement of debt), return 5.3 billion to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments, and increase our available cash on hand by 969 million. The debt borrowings and repayments are described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

 As previously noted, our operations generated 8.0 billion of cash in the first nine months of 2023, driven primarily by net income of 7.9 billion and noncash charges to income of 1.8 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of 1.7 billion. Noncash charges primarily included 2.0 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 10 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for an analysis of the significant components of our net income. 
 
 Our investing activities primarily consisted of 1.4 billion in capital investments, of which 239 million related to capital investments made by DGD. 
 
 Our Capital Resources 
 Our material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of working capital requirements, capital investments, contractual obligations, and other matters, as described below. Our operations have historically generated positive cash flows to fulfill our working capital requirements and other uses of cash as discussed below. 
 
 Capital Investments 
 Capital investments are composed of our capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, as reflected in our statements of cash flows as shown on page 6 . Capital investments exclude acquisitions, if any. 
 We have publicly announced GHG emissions reduction/displacement targets and a long-term ambition. We believe that our allocation of growth capital into low-carbon projects to date has been consistent with such targets and ambition. Certain low-carbon projects have been completed or are already in execution and the associated capital investments are included in our expected capital investments for 2024. Our capital investments in future years to achieve these targets and ambition are expected to include investments associated with certain low-carbon projects currently at various stages of progress, evaluation, or approval. For additional information, see the RISK FACTORS section included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 As previously disclosed, in January 2023, we announced that DGD approved a large-scale SAF project. The SAF project at the DGD Port Arthur Plant was successfully completed in October 2024. The project is expected to be fully operational this year, providing the plant the optionality to upgrade approximately 50 percent of its current 470 million gallon renewable diesel annual production capacity to SAF. 
 
 Capital Investments Attributable to Valero 
 Capital investments attributable to Valero is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, excluding the portion of DGD s capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of other consolidated VIEs. 
 We are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and consolidate its financial statements, and DGD s operations compose our Renewable Diesel segment. As a result, all of DGD s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities. DGD s members use DGD s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member, only 
 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 50 percent of DGD s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments. We also exclude all of the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we consolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. See Note 6 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the VIEs that we consolidate. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments. 
 
 Capital investments attributable to Valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments, which is the most comparable GAAP measure, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently, which may diminish its utility. 
 
 The following table (in millions) reconciles our capital investments to capital investments attributable to Valero for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 We have developed an extensive multi-year capital investment program, which we update and revise based on changing internal and external factors. As previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we expect to incur approximately 2.0 billion for capital investments attributable to Valero during 2024. Approximately 1.6 billion of the expected capital investments attributable to Valero are for sustaining the business and the balance towards growth strategies, of which approximately half is allocated to expanding our low-carbon businesses.

 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, our contractual obligations included debt obligations, interest payments related to debt obligations, operating lease liabilities, finance lease obligations, other long-term liabilities, and purchase obligations. In the ordinary course of business, we had debt-related activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Stock Purchase Programs 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased for treasury 17,054,864 of our shares for a total cost of 2.6 billion. See Note 5 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our stock purchase programs. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.1 billion remaining available for purchase under the February 2024 Program. On September 19, 2024, our Board authorized us to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock for a total cost of up to 2.5 billion with no expiration date, which is in addition to the amount remaining under the February 2024 Program. We will continue to evaluate the timing of purchases when appropriate. We have no obligation to make purchases under these programs. 
 Pension Plan Funding 
 We contributed 71 million to our pension plans and 13 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Held by Our Foreign Subsidiaries 
 As of September 30, 2024, 4.3 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated to us through dividends without any U.S. federal income tax consequences, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions, U.S. state income taxes, and U.S. federal income tax on foreign exchange gains. Therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries to us. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by government authorities relating to, among other matters, the discharge of materials into the environment, climate, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG and other emissions, our facilities and operations, and characteristics and composition of many of our products. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future costs and expenditures required for environmental matters could increase. 
 
 Concentration of Customers 
 Our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, including the uncertainties concerning worldwide events causing volatility in the global crude oil markets. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 The following tables provide information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A 10 percent increase or decrease in our floating interest rates would not have a material effect to our results of operations. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. See Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt.

 ________________________ 
 (a) Excludes unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. 
 OTHER MARKET RISKS 
 
 We are exposed to market risks primarily related to the volatility in the price of commodities, the price of credits needed to comply with the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuel Programs, and foreign currency exchange rates. There have been no material changes to these market risks disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 12 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these market risks as of September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no new proceedings required to be disclosed in this item under SEC regulations and no material developments in proceedings that we previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 or in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Pursuant to SEC regulations, we use a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of certain environmental proceedings is required in this item. We believe any such proceedings less than this threshold are not material to our business and financial condition.
