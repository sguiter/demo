FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 For the nine months

and , incurred net
loss in amount of and for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company currently has limited working capital
and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period
of time. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

 Management
anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The
Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s
efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and
continue as a going concern.

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 

Marky Corp. we, us, or
the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming, U.S. on April 28, 2022 (Inception). Marky Corp. is
a provider of social media marketing information services. We provide a platform that offers subscribers access to valuable social media
marketing information. The Company is operating an information site, posting global marketing and advertising news on social networks
https://markycopr.com/ . Our platform is a web-based information portal, accessed through a web browser. It allows end users
to access information on any device of their choice, features social media marketing news, updates, tips, and tutorials on promoting their
business on social media. 

 The platform includes RSS Feeds,
allowing users to consolidate updates and content from preferred websites. Three subscription plans - Basic, Pro, and Enterprise - are
available for accessing RSS Feeds. The Company owns social media management mobile application "Marky News", available on both
Apple Store and as an APK file. The application offers exclusive access to SMM resources and industry updates, providing real-time
alerts and valuable insights into social media marketing trends. 

 The member of our management has accumulated extensive
expertise, knowledge, and a robust network in the realms of marketing and social media advertising. This encompasses proficiency in digital
advertising, social media strategies, operational excellence and product development and deployment. We intend to utilize management's
industry knowledge and professional network to enhance our strategic position. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

We plan to capitalize our information and education
platform for specialized industries. We anticipate that the primary source of our revenue will stem from our information
platform and the sale of subscription plans available on the Company s website. 

Competition 

In the realm of niche software and website development,
Marky Corp. finds itself amidst a highly competitive landscape. This industry boasts low entry barriers, making it susceptible to the
influx of new entrants eager to establish their presence. The presence of these newcomers only adds to the already significant competitive
pressures that we encounter. 

Furthermore, within this competitive arena, Marky
Corp. operates as a unique entity, serving as an information site dedicated to the dissemination of global marketing and advertising news
through social networks. This niche specialization presents both opportunities and challenges for us. It sets us apart from conventional
software and website development firms, but at the same time, it narrows our target audience to those specifically seeking specialized
marketing insights. 

In our competitive environment, we find ourselves
in direct competition with several well-established rivals. Notable among them are companies like Sociallyin, SmartSites, and NinjaPromo.
These competitors are backed by reputable organizations known for providing services analogous to our offerings. They not only boast a
proven track record but also have substantial existing customer bases, which form a significant portion of our intended client demographic. 

14 

Most of our competitors have one or more advantages
over us, including: 

Established Reputation 

 Large Existing Customer Base 

 Extensive Resource 

 Strong Industry Partnerships 

 Customization and Scalability 

 Brand Recognition 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to various federal, state and international
laws and regulations that affect our business, including those relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal
information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, and sweepstakes
and contests. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations
on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or
employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our
business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements
and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. 

Employees 

We are a start-up company and currently have one employee
- Kos Ramirez Maximiliano, our president, treasurer, secretary and director. We intend to outsource any additional services if the business
requires. 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023:

sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Limited Operating History and Need for Additional
Capital 

There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have generated limited revenues. Our business
is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost
overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. 

We have no assurance that future financing will be
available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand
our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not Applicable. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation as of October 31, 2024,

officer, who are one and the same, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f)
and 15d 15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of
the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
