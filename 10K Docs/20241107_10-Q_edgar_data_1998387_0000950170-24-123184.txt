days after the end of such calendar quarter. No Reimbursement Payment for any applicable calendar quarter shall be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share declared by the Company at the time of such proposed Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) the Company s Operating Expense Ratio at the time of such proposed Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365-day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing all of the Company s operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies, less organizational and offering expenses, Management Fees and Incentive Fees owed to the Advisor, and interest expense, by the Company s net assets. Either the Company or the Advisor may terminate the Expense Support Agreement at any time, with or without notice, without the payment of any penalty, provided that any Expense Payments that have not been reimbursed by the Company to the Advisor will remain the Company s obligation following any such termination, subject to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement.

The Company may or may not reimburse remaining amounts under the Expense Support Agreement in the future. The Company does not consider the Reimbursement Payment to be probable and estimable as of September 30, 2024 as described in ASC 450 Contingencies . At the time expenses paid by the Advisor on behalf of the Company meet the conditions for reimbursement under the Expense Support Agreement, the Company will recognize the liability as due to the Advisor.

These shares of Common Stock were issued and sold in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act, which provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act.

Each holder of the Preferred Stock is entitled to a liquidation preference of per share (the Liquidation Value with respect to distributions, including the payment of dividends and distribution of the Company s assets upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up. The Preferred Stock is senior to all other classes and series of Common Stock, and rank on parity with any other class or series of preferred stock of the Company, whether such class or series is now existing or is created in the future, to the extent of the aggregate Liquidation Value and all accrued but unpaid dividends and any applicable redemption premium on the Preferred Stock. Dividends on each share of Preferred Stock accrue on a daily basis at the rate of per annum of the sum of the Liquidation Value thereof plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon- (the "Preferred Dividends"), from and including the date of issuance, or, if any shares of Preferred Stock are issued after the first dividend period, dividends on such shares shall accrue and be cumulative from the day immediately following the most recent dividend payment date, to and including the earlier of (1) the date of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or (2) the date on which such Preferred Stock is redeemed. Dividends accrue whether or not they have been authorized or declared, whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the Company legally available for the payment of dividends. Dividends are payable semi-annually. The Preferred Stock is subject to redemption at the Company's option any time by notice of such redemption on a date selected by the Company for such redemption, such date being referred to as the Redemption Date. If the Company elects to cause the redemption of the Preferred Stock, each share of Preferred Stock will be redeemed for a price, payable in cash on the Redemption Date, equal to of such share s Liquidation Value, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the Redemption Date, plus a redemption premium per share as follows: (1) if the redemption date occurs prior to the second (2nd) anniversary of the date of the original issuance of the Preferred Stock, a redemption premium of ; and (2) thereafter, no redemption premium.

Distributions and Dividend Reinvestment During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , distributions had been declared or paid by the Company in regard to both the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock.

The Company will record an obligation for Preferred Dividends once declared. Income available to common shareholders was adjusted for these dividends for purposes of presenting earnings per share. With respect to distributions on Common Stock, the Company has adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for stockholders. As a result, if the Company s Board of Directors authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, each Stockholder that has not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of Common Stock are generally subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Ana lysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The information in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. 
 The following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our financial statements, including a brief discussion of our business, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included or incorporated in this Report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods. 
 Overview and Investment Framework 
 5C Lending Partners Corp. (the Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland and was formed on October 16, 2023. The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended 1940 Act ). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our tax year ending December 31, 2024, we will elect to be treated, and we intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; as amended (the Code ). As a BDC and a RIC, we will be required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We are managed by 5C Lending Partners Advisor LLC (the Advisor ). The Advisor is a limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). The Advisor is responsible for managing our day-to-day operations and providing investment advisory and management services to the Company. 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation primarily by investing in U.S.-domiciled upper middle-market companies through direct originations of first lien debt (including stand-alone first lien loans, unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position and first lien secured bonds) and, to a lesser extent, second lien debt, unsecured debt and equity or equity-related investments. The Company generally considers upper middle-market companies to consist of companies with earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization between 50 million to 500 million annually at the time of investment. The Company may from time to time invest in smaller or larger companies and other instruments if the Advisor believes that the opportunity presents attractive investment characteristics and the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Under normal market conditions, we generally invest at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit instruments issued by corporate issuers (including loans, notes, bonds and other corporate debt securities). The Company s 80 policy with respect to investments in credit-related instruments is not fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Directors without Stockholder approval. Stockholders will be provided with sixty (60) days notice in the manner prescribed by the SEC before making any change to this policy. We invest primarily in private companies based in the United States, which is subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 of our assets in U.S. companies. 
 Although not expected to be a primary component of the Company s investment strategy, the Company may also selectively make opportunistic investments in portfolios of loans, receivables or other debt instruments, traded loans, and securities of corporate issuers when market conditions create opportunities with a compelling risk profile, and potential strategic opportunities, including acquisitions of other private and public finance companies, business development companies and asset managers. 
 Most of the Company s debt investments are expected to be unrated. When rated by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization, the Company expects that its debt investments will generally carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3 by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. or lower than BBB- by Standard Poor s Rating Services), which is often referred to as junk. 
 The Company will employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the limitations set forth in the 1940 Act. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, the Company is required to have an asset coverage ratio of at least 150 , which means for every 100 of net assets the Company holds, the Company may raise 200 from borrowing and issuing senior securities (including debt and preferred stock). Under the 1940 Act, any preferred stock we issue, including the Preferred Stock will constitute a senior security for purposes of the 150 asset coverage test. Any such leverage, would be expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. 
 16 

The Company intends to seek to list its shares of Common Stock on a national securities exchange (an "Exchange Listing") as determined by the Advisor in its sole discretion within seven years of the initial closing, subject to an additional one-year extension with the approval of the Board of Directors. Any Exchange Listing is subject to future market conditions and there can be no assurance that any exchange listing will occur. Until any Exchange Listing, the Company s Common Stock is not registered under the 1933 Act, or any state securities law, and will be restricted as to transfer by law and the terms of the charter of the Company. 
 The Company commenced operations on September 26, 2024, the date on which the Company issued 515 shares of Preferred Stock. Prior to the commencement of operations, our efforts were limited to the organization of and preparation for the Company s commencement of operations and future operations. The organizational expenses of 925 and 2,285 incurred by the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were advanced by our Advisor and are subject to conditional reimbursement by us pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, which is described in Note 3 to our Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3, respectively, for additional information on the Company s organizational expenses and the terms governing the Expense Support Agreement. 
 Key Components and Our Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We plan to generate revenue primarily from interest income on debt investments, capital gains and dividend income. Our debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In certain cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred or payment-in-kind PIK interest payments. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at maturity date. In addition, the Company may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication, due diligence and other fees. 
 Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Advisor, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Advisor. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (a) investment advisory fees, including the Management Fees and Incentive Fees, to the Advisor, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement (b) our allocable portion of compensation, overhead (including rent) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (ii) compensation of investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals of the Administrator that perform duties for us and (iii) costs associated with compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended and (c) all other expenses of our operations, administrations and transactions. 
 With respect to costs incurred in connection with our organization and offering, the Advisor has agreed to advance all such costs on our behalf. Unless the Advisor waives or elects to cover such expenses pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, we will be obligated to reimburse the Advisor for such advanced expenses. See the Expense Support Agreement section below. Any reimbursements that may be made by us in the future will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Advisor and its affiliates. 
 Expense Support Agreement 
 We have entered into the Expense Support Agreement with the Advisor. For additional information see Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements, Note 3 Agreements and Related Party Transactions.

 Administration Services Expenses 
 Administrative service expenses represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead, technology and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. Refer to Note 3 to our financial statements for additional information regarding the Administration Agreement and the administrative fees thereunder.

 Costs associated with the offering of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock are capitalized as deferred offering costs and included on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and amortized over a twelve-month period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 519 and 1,057 in offering costs, respectively, of which 17 was amortized to expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Other general and administrative expenses include director fees, insurance, filing, research, sub-administrator, subscriptions and other costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 84 in other general and administrative expenses. 
 Compensation to the Advisor 
 We pay the Advisor investment advisory fees for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a Management Fee and an Incentive Fee. The cost of both the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee is borne by the Company s stockholders. 
 18 

Management Fee 
 The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The Management Fee is payable at an annual rate of 0.60 of the average value of the Company s gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the Company s two most recently completed calendar quarters. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, gross assets means the Company s total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. The Management Fee for any partial quarter is appropriately prorated (based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter). See Note 3 to our financial statements for additional information regarding the Investment Advisory Agreement and the fee arrangement thereunder. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred Management Fees of 99 dollars. 
 Incentive Fee 
 We pay the Advisor an Incentive Fee consisting of two parts: (i) an Investment Income Incentive Fee and (ii) a Capital Gains Incentive Fee. The Investment Income Incentive Fee will be calculated and payable on a quarterly basis, in arrears, and will equal 10.0 (17.5 in the event of an Exchange Listing) of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (defined below) for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a quarterly preferred return of 1.50 (i.e., 6.0 annualized), or Hurdle, measured on a quarterly basis and subject to a 100 catch-up feature. See Note 3 to our financial statements for additional information regarding the Investment Advisory Agreement and the fee arrangement thereunder. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not incur any Incentive Fees. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We intend to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of the Private Offering and other future offerings of equity or debt securities, (ii) cash flows from our operations, and (iii) proceeds from borrowings from banks or other lenders. To the extent we determined that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into one or more credit facilities including revolving credit facilities, or issue other senior securities. We would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. 
 In addition, we may raise capital by securitizing certain of our investments, including through the formation of one or more collateralized loan obligations or warehouse facilities, while retaining all or most of the exposure to the performance of these investments. This would involve contributing a pool of assets to a special purpose entity, and selling debt interests in such entity to purchasers on a non-recourse or limited recourse basis. 
 Our primary use of cash will be (i) investments in portfolio companies, (ii) payments of the Company s expenses, (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of our borrowings, and (iv) cash distributions to the Company s stockholders. 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our needs for our daily operations for at least the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,448 in cash and cash equivalents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used for operating activities was 122 while cash provided by financing activities was 3,570 primarily from the proceeds of the issuance of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not hold any debt. 
 Equity 
 On July 10, 2024, the Advisor seeded the Company by purchasing 1,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, par value 0.001 per share, at a price of 25.00 per share as the Company s initial capital. On September 26, 2024 the Company issued and sold 80,000 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate offering price of 2,000. After the draw-down, the Company had 18,000 in unfunded Capital Commitments. 
 Additionally, on September 26, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of its 12.0 Series A cumulative preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock to unaffiliated individual investors who are accredited investors as defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act. Pursuant to this private offering we issued and sold 515 shares of Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1,545. The holders of the Preferred Stock are subject to certain dividend, voting, liquidation and other rights that are more fully described in Note 5 to our Financial Statements. 
 19 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have issued 515 shares of Preferred Stock and may in the future issue additional series of preferred stock, though it has no intention to do so. For additional information on the Company s offering of Preferred Stock, refer to Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements, Note 5 Net Assets . 
 Distributions 
 We intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify each taxable year for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income (if any) for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no distributions had been declared or paid by the Company in regard to both Common Stock and the Preferred Stock. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 Borrowings 
 We intend to enter into one or more credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate our investment objectives. It is anticipated that such credit facilities typically will bear interest at floating rate spreads over SOFR or other applicable reference rates. Shareholders will bear the costs associated with any borrowings under our financing arrangements. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may require us to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. In addition, from time to time, our losses on leveraged investments may result in the liquidation of other investments held by us and may result in additional drawdowns to repay such amounts. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Advisor to provide us with investment advisory services and the Administration Agreement with the Administrator to provide us with administrative services. We entered into the Expense Support Agreement with the Advisor to provide us with support with respect to certain expenses and subject to reimbursement. Payments for investment advisory services under the Investment Advisory Agreement, reimbursements under the Administration Agreement and reimbursements under the Expense Support Agreement are described in Item 1. Financial Statement-Notes to Financial Statement-Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 From time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. On September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation. 
 Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 

the Administration Agreement; 

the Expense Support Agreement; 

the Resource Sharing Agreement; and 

the License Agreement. 

20 

In addition to the aforementioned agreements, the Company has applied for, and expects to be granted, an exemptive order from the SEC to co-invest alongside other funds and accounts managed and controlled by the Advisor and its affiliates, in a manner consistent with the Company's investment objective, policies and restrictions as well as applicable regulatory requirements. See Note 3 to our Financial Statements. 
 Recent Developments 
 The Company has closed on Capital Commitments in its private offering totaling 604,804, of which 23,950 is from affiliates of the Company, as of November 7, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. The Company has identified income tax as the Company s most critical accounting estimates currently. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the Company s estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. 
 Income Taxes 
 We elected to be treated, and intend to qualify each year thereafter, as a RIC. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal or state income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that the Company distributes to the stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax benefits, the Company must distribute to the Company s stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of the Company s investment company taxable income, which is generally the Company s ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the Annual Distribution Requirement ). 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitativ e Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 The Company is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Because we expect to borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend in part upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds as well as our level of leverage. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s net investment income or net assets. 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may hedge against interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or a credit facility subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currencies, such activities may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to the portion of the Company s portfolio of investments, if any, with fixed interest rates or denominated in foreign currencies. 
 21 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Presidents and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Presidents and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 22 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal P roceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us. We may be a party to certain lawsuits in the normal course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with our activities or the activities of our portfolio companies. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
