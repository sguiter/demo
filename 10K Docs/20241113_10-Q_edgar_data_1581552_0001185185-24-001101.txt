From 2018 through 2023, the Partnership drilled and completed new wells; the Partnership s estimated share of capital expenditures for the drilling and completion of these 86 wells totaled approximately million. Since October 2023, the Partnership elected to participate in more wells, of which all have been completed as of September 30, 2024. The Partnership has an approximate non-operated working interest in these 15 wells. The total estimated cost to the Partnership to drill and complete these 15 wells is approximately million; the Partnership has incurred approximately million in capital expenditures to date related to these wells as of September 30, 2024.

As of the Effective Date, the borrowing base of the BF Credit Facility is . 	 	 

As amended, the Partnership remains subject to a semiannual redetermination of its borrowing base, but the Partnership is only required to perform an annual analysis of its proven oil and natural gas reserves as of January 1 of each year. 

The Partnership paid a loan fee to the Lender associated with the Fifth Amendment of . 	 	 

Loan costs associated with the Fifth Amendment, which totaled approximately , were capitalized and will be amortized through the Revised Maturity Date. The interest rate is equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus , with a floor of . 

Any advances under the BF Credit Facility are to be used to fund capital expenditures for the development of the Partnership s undrilled acreage. Under the terms of the BF Loan Agreement, the Partnership may make voluntary prepayments, in whole or in part, at any time with no penalty. . 

The BF Loan Agreement requires the Partnership to maintain a risk management program to manage the commodity price risk of the Partnership s future oil and gas production under certain conditions. As amended in August 2022, the Partnership is not required to enter into future hedging transactions as long as the Partnership maintains a BF Credit Facility utilization rate of less than or equal to 20 of the Partnership s PV-9 (defined as the net present value, discounted at 9 per annum), as calculated by the Lender during the Lender s scheduled redeterminations. However, the Partnership must hedge at least 50 of its rolling 12-month projected future production if the Partnership s utilization of the BF Credit Facility is greater than 20 but less than or equal to 30 of PV-9, and at least 50 of its rolling 24-month projected future production if the Partnership s utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility is greater than 30 of PV-9. Based on the Partnership s utilization of the BF Credit Facility and Lender s current calculation of PV-9, the Partnership was not subject to any hedging requirements under the amended BF Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 

The BF Credit Facility contains prepayment requirements, customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Certain of the financial covenants include: 

A minimum ratio of trailing 12-month EBITDAX to debt service coverage of 1.20 to 1.0 

A minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.00 to 1.00

In addition, the Partnership and the Lender entered into a Sixth Amendment to the BF Loan Agreement, which allows the Partnership to include any unused amount of BF Credit Facility in its calculation of current assets beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Partnership was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance on the BF Credit Facility was million, and the interest rate was . The outstanding balance of million at September 30, 2024 approximated the fair market value of the BF Credit Facility. The Partnership estimated the fair value of its credit facility by discounting the future cash flows of the instrument at estimated market rates consistent with the maturity of a debt obligation with similar credit terms and credit characteristics, which are Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Certain statements within this report may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are those that do not relate solely to historical fact. They include, but are not limited to, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance, achievements or events. You can identify these statements by the use of words such as may, will, could, anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, predict, continue, further, seek, plan or project and variations of these words or comparable words or phrases of similar meaning. 

These forward-looking statements include such things as: 

any impact of the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian and Middle Eastern conflicts on the global energy markets; 

references to future success in the Partnership s drilling and marketing activities; 

the Partnership s business strategy; 

estimated future distributions; 

estimated future capital expenditures; 

sales of the Partnership s properties and other liquidity events; 

competitive strengths and goals; and 

other similar matters. 

These forward-looking statements reflect the Partnership s current beliefs and expectations with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors outside the Partnership s control that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those described under Risk Factors in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the following: 

that the Partnership s development of its oil and gas properties may not be successful or that the Partnership s operations on such properties may not be successful; 

general economic, market, or business conditions; 

changes in laws or regulations; 

the risk that the wells in which the Partnership acquired an interest are productive, but do not produce enough revenue to return the investment made; 

the risk that the wells the Partnership drills do not find hydrocarbons in commercial quantities or, even if commercial quantities are encountered, that actual production is lower than expected on the productive life of wells is shorter than expected; 

current credit market conditions and the Partnership s ability to obtain long-term financing or refinancing debt for the Partnership s drilling activities in a timely manner and on terms that are consistent with what the Partnership projects; 

uncertainties concerning the price of oil and natural gas, which may decrease and remain low for prolonged periods; and 

the risk that any hedging policy the Partnership employs to reduce the effects of changes in the prices of the Partnership s production will not be effective. 

Although the Partnership believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, the Partnership cannot assure investors that its expectations will be attained or that any deviations will not be material. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and that, except as required by law, the Partnership undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect any future events or circumstances. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Partnership or to individuals acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this section. 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Partnership s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the information contained in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Overview 

The Partnership was formed as a Delaware limited partnership. The general partner is Energy 11 GP, LLC (the General Partner ). The initial capitalization of the Partnership of 1,000 occurred on July 9, 2013. The Partnership began offering common units of limited partner interest (the common units on a best-efforts basis on January 22, 2015, the date the Partnership s initial Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-197476) was declared effective by the SEC. The Partnership completed its best-efforts offering on April 24, 2017. Total common units sold were approximately 19.0 million for gross proceeds of 374.2 million and proceeds net of offering costs of 349.6 million. 

The Partnership has no officers, directors or employees. Instead, the General Partner manages the day-to-day affairs of the Partnership. All decisions regarding the management of the Partnership made by the General Partner are made by the Board of Directors of the General Partner and its officers. 

The Partnership was formed to acquire and develop oil and gas properties located onshore in the United States. On December 18, 2015, the Partnership completed its first purchase in the Sanish field, acquiring an approximate 11 non-operated working interest in the Sanish Field Assets for approximately 159.6 million. On January 11, 2017, the Partnership closed on its second purchase in the Sanish field, acquiring an additional approximate 11 non-operated working interest in the Sanish Field Assets for approximately 128.5 million. On March 31, 2017, the Partnership closed on its third purchase in the Sanish field, acquiring an additional approximate average 10.5 non-operated working interest in 82 of the Partnership s then 216 existing producing wells and 150 of the Partnership s then 253 future development locations in the Sanish Field Assets for approximately 52.4 million. 

The Partnership drilled and completed 86 new wells from 2018 through 2023; the Partnership s estimated share of capital expenditures for the drilling and completion of these 86 wells totaled approximately 120 million. Since October 2023, the Partnership elected to participate in 15 more wells, of which all have been completed as of September 30, 2024. The total estimated cost to the Partnership for these 15 wells is approximately 26 million, of which approximately 20.1 million has been incurred to date as of September 30, 2024. See additional detail in Oil and Natural Gas Properties below. 

As a result of its acquisitions and completed drilling during the period of ownership, as of September 30, 2024, the Partnership owned an approximate 24 non-operated working interest in 312 producing wells and future development sites in the Sanish field located in Mountrail County, North Dakota (collectively, the Sanish Field Assets ). Chord Energy Corporation Chord ), the product of a merger between Whiting Petroleum Corporation and Oasis Petroleum Inc., is one of the largest producers in the basin and operates substantially all of the Sanish Field Assets. 

Current Price Environment 

Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids NGL prices are determined by many factors outside of the Partnership s control. Historically, world-wide oil and natural gas prices and markets have been subject to significant change and may continue to be in the future. Global macroeconomic factors contributing to uncertainty within the industry include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil-producing regions of the world, particularly Russia and the Middle East; forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with forecasted global supply; supply levels of oil and natural gas due to exploration and development activities in the United States; environmental and climate change regulation; actions taken by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. 

The length and outcome of the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia as well as continued unrest in the Middle East are highly unpredictable, and further escalation of these conflicts could lead to significant market and other disruptions, such as volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability and other material and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions. The short- and long-term impact of these conflicts on the operations and financial condition of the Partnership and the global economy is uncertain.

Based on average NYMEX futures closing prices (oil) and NYMEX/Henry Hub spot prices (natural gas) 

The Partnership s oil and natural gas revenues are heavily weighted to oil, so any material change to market pricing for oil has a more significant impact to the Partnership s operational performance. If commodity prices significantly drop and remain low, the Partnership will see a reduction in available capital for the development of its undrilled wellsites. Future growth is dependent on the Partnership s ability to add reserves in excess of production. In addition to commodity price fluctuations, the Partnership faces the challenge of natural production volume declines. As reservoirs are depleted, oil and natural gas production from Partnership wells will decrease. 

Results of Operations 

In evaluating financial condition and operating performance, the most important indicators on which the Partnership focuses are (1) total quarterly sold production in barrel of oil equivalent BOE units, (2) average sales price per unit for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids NGL or NGLs ), (3) production costs per BOE and (4) capital expenditures. 

The following table summarizes the results from operations, including production, of the Partnership s non-operated working interest for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Oil, natural gas and NGL revenues 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL sales were 25.3 million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were 22.4 million, which resulted in a realized price of 73.89 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were 0.5 million, which resulted in a realized price of 1.39 per Mcf. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were 2.4 million, which resulted in a realized price of 32.34 per BOE of sold production. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL sales were 24.1 million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were 21.3 million, which resulted in a realized price of 82.86 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were 0.8 million, which resulted in a realized price of 2.06 per Mcf. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were 1.9 million, which resulted in a realized price of 28.34 per BOE of sold production. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL sales were 60.7 million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were 53.0 million, which resulted in a realized price of 76.03 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were 1.7 million, which resulted in a realized price of 1.62 per Mcf. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were 6.0 million, which resulted in a realized price of 32.90 per BOE of sold production. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL sales were 76.1 million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were 67.3 million, which resulted in a realized price of 77.90 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were 3.0 million, which resulted in a realized price of 2.40 per Mcf. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were 5.8 million, which resulted in a realized price of 29.24 per BOE of sold production. 

The Partnership s operating results for the third quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by 15 new wells being turned to production during the quarter. These 15 wells boosted sold production to over 5,000 BOE per day for the month of September 2024 (4,800 BOE per day for the three months ended September 30, 2024). Sold production for the Sanish Field Assets was approximately 4,300 BOE per day for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

While the completion of the 15 wells has helped to offset the ongoing impacts of adverse weather conditions in North Dakota during a multi-day stretch in mid-January that has led to suspended production from nearly 20 of the Sanish Field Asset wells during 2024, sold production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3,900 BOE per day was approximately 17 less than the nine months ended September 2023. Year-to-date sold production through the third quarter of 2023 was 4,700 BOE per day, primarily the result of the completion of approximately 30 wells during the second half of 2022. 

In conjunction with commodity market pricing, the Partnership s results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by lower realized sales prices for oil (see Oil differentials below) and natural gas compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Continued high inventories and lower demand across the country has kept natural gas prices low throughout 2024. 

If the operators of the Sanish Field Assets are unable to produce, process and sell oil and natural gas at economical prices, these operators may curtail daily production, shut-in producing wells or seek other cost-cutting measures, and could continue so long as producing is uneconomical. Consequently, any of these measures could significantly impact the Partnership s oil, natural gas and NGL production. Further, production is dependent on the investment in existing wells and the development of new wells. See further discussion of the Partnership s investment in new wells in Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 

Oil differentials 

The realized prices per barrel of oil above are based upon the NYMEX benchmark price less a cost to distribute the oil, or the differential. Oil price differentials primarily represent the transportation costs in moving produced oil at the wellhead to a refinery and are based on the availability of pipeline, rail and other transportation methods out of the Sanish field. Oil price differentials to the NYMEX benchmark price vary by operator based upon operator-specific contracts. On average, the Partnership s realized oil differential has increased by approximately 1.50 per barrel of oil during the three quarters of 2024 in comparison to the same period of 2023, which has resulted in lower realized oil sales prices. 

The Dakota Access Pipeline is a significant pipeline that transports oil and natural gas from North Dakota fields. Its use by operators in the region is currently in ongoing litigation. If use of the Dakota Access Pipeline or any other region pipelines is suspended at a future date, the disruption of transporting the Partnership s production out of North Dakota could negatively impact the Partnership s oil differentials, realized sales prices, results of operations and/or cash flows.

Index 

Operating costs and expenses 

Production expenses 

Production expenses are daily costs incurred by the Partnership to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to market, along with the daily costs incurred to maintain producing properties. Such costs include field personnel compensation, saltwater disposal, utilities, maintenance, repairs and servicing expenses related to the Partnership s oil and natural gas properties, along with the gathering and processing contract in effect for the extraction, transportation, treatment and marketing of oil and natural gas. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, production expenses were 5.7 million and 6.4 million, respectively, and production expenses per BOE of sold production were 13.09 and 16.31, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, production expenses were 15.9 million and 20.6 million, respectively, and production expenses per BOE of sold production were 15.03 and 16.23, respectively. The Partnership s lease operating and workover expenses have been lower during 2024, and due to lower sold production of natural gas and NGLs, compared to 2023, marketing and selling costs have also decreased in 2024. Lower expenses coupled with higher production volumes have resulted in lower production expenses per BOE for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the production base over which fixed operating costs are spread has increased. 

Production taxes 

Taxes on the production and extraction of oil and gas are regulated and set by North Dakota tax authorities. Taxes on the sale of gas and NGL products are less than taxes levied on the sale of oil. Therefore, production taxes as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate dependent upon the ratio of sales of natural gas and NGLs to total sales. Production taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.1 million (8 of revenue) and 1.9 million (8 of revenue), respectively. Production taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.8 million (8 of revenue) and 6.0 million (8 of revenue), respectively. 

General and administrative expenses 

The principal components of general and administrative expense are accounting, legal and consulting fees. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.9 million and 1.4 million, respectively. The Partnership realized a decrease in personnel-related costs and legal expenses during the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. 

Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion DD A 

DD A of capitalized drilling and development costs of producing oil, natural gas and NGL properties are computed using the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Costs of acquiring proved properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves. DD A for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.5 million and 6.5 million, and DD A per BOE of sold production was 19.43 and 16.60, respectively. DD A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 20.0 million in both periods, and DD A per BOE of sold production was 18.93 and 15.74, respectively. The increase in DD A expense per BOE of production for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the decrease of the Partnership s estimated proved undeveloped reserves during the most recent reserves analyses (as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024) resulting from changes in well production forecasts. 

Gain on derivatives, net 

Participation in the oil and gas industry exposes the Partnership to risks associated with potentially volatile changes in energy commodity prices, and therefore, the Partnership s future earnings are subject to these risks. Periodically, the Partnership utilizes derivative contracts to manage the commodity price risk on the Partnership s future oil production it will produce and sell and to reduce the effect of volatility in commodity price changes to provide a base level of cash flow from operations. In September 2023, the Partnership settled its final future oil production contract that was required under the original terms and conditions of the BF Loan Agreement.

Index 

The Partnership did not designate its 2023 derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and did not enter into such instruments for speculative trading purposes. As a result, when derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as a hedge, the changes in the fair value are recognized on the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations as a gain or loss on derivative instruments. The following table presents settlements of its matured derivative instruments and the non-cash, mark-to-market gains or losses recorded during the periods presented.

The Partnership s oil production contracts that expired during the three months ended September 30, 2023 represented approximately 76,000 barrels of oil. The Partnership realized a loss of approximately 1.3 million, equating to an approximate loss of 16.90 per barrel, on its hedged oil production, and an approximate loss of 4.99 per barrel of total sold oil production for the third quarter of 2023. The Partnership s natural gas production contracts that expired during the three months ended September 30, 2023 represented 63,000 MMBtu of produced natural gas; however, these natural gas production contracts were settled at no cost or benefit to the Partnership, as contract prices on settlement dates were within the established floor and ceiling prices. 

The Partnership s oil production contracts that expired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represented approximately 224,000 barrels of oil. The Partnership realized a loss of approximately 1.8 million, equating to an approximate loss of 7.95 per barrel, on its hedged oil production, and an approximate loss of 2.06 per barrel of total year-to-date sold oil production through the third quarter of 2023. The Partnership s natural gas production contracts that expired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represented 275,000 MMBtu of produced natural gas; however, these natural gas production contracts were settled at no cost or benefit to the Partnership, as contract prices on settlement dates were within the established floor and ceiling prices. 

The mark-to-market (non-cash, unrealized) gain recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 represents the change in fair value of the Partnership s derivative instruments held at period-end. Unrealized gains (or losses) do not represent actual settlements or payments made to or from the counterparty. 

Interest expense, net 

Interest expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 43,000 and 0.2 million, respectively. Interest expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 122,000 and 1.0 million, respectively. The primary components of Interest expense, net, during 2023 and 2024 were interest expense on the BF Credit Facility, amortization of capitalized loan costs and non-use fees under the BF Loan Agreement. 

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measure 

The Partnership uses Adjusted EBITDAX , defined as earnings before (i) interest expense, net; (ii) income taxes; (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion; (iv) exploration expenses; and (v) (gain)/loss on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments, as a key supplemental measure of its operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Partnership s cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although Adjusted EBITDAX, as calculated by the Partnership, may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDAX as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Partnership defines such terms, the Partnership believes this supplemental measure is useful to investors when comparing the Partnership s results between periods and with other energy companies. 

The Partnership believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX is important to provide investors with additional information (i) to provide an important supplemental indicator of the operational performance of the Partnership s business without regard to financing methods and capital structure, and (ii) to measure the operational performance of the Partnership s operators.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Historically, the Partnership s principal sources of liquidity have been cash on hand, the cash flow generated from the Sanish Field Assets, and availability under the Partnership s revolving credit facility, if any. The Partnership had approximately 0.4 million in cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, and the Partnership generated approximately 32.7 million and 66.3 million in cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. In February 2024, the Partnership successfully renewed its BF Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership had a receivable balance from its operators of approximately 16 million for sold production from newly-completed wells. In October and November, the Partnership received approximately 4.9 million and 10.8 million in cash proceeds, respectively, related to the 15 new wells and its existing wells, thus reducing the receivable. Using those proceeds, the Partnership paid off the 1.3 million balance outstanding on the BF Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. Therefore, at the time of filing of this Form 10-Q, the Partnership has 20 million in availability under the BF Credit Facility. 

The Partnership anticipates its cash on-hand, cash flow from operations and availability under the BF Credit Facility will be adequate to meet its liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, including completing the outstanding capital expenditures discussed below (see Oil and Natural Gas Properties ). Based on the terms and conditions of the February 2024 fifth amendment to the BF Loan Agreement, the Partnership is permitted to make distributions to limited partners regardless of BF Credit Facility utilization so long as the Partnership is in compliance with the applicable covenants and no other event of default has occurred. The General Partner will monitor payment of future monthly Partnership distributions in conjunction with the Partnership s projected cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures for new wells and payments on the BF credit facility, as necessary based on usage. 

The Partnership s revenues and cash flow from operations are highly sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas prices and to levels of production. If commodity prices significantly drop and remain low, the Partnership s cash flow from operations may decline. This could have a significant impact on the Partnership s available cash on-hand, the Partnership s ability to participate in future drilling programs as proposed by the operators of the Sanish Field Assets and/or to fund any future distributions to its limited partners. Future growth is dependent on the Partnership s ability to add reserves in excess of production. In addition to commodity price fluctuations, the Partnership faces the challenge of natural production volume declines. As reservoirs are depleted, oil and natural gas production from Partnership wells will decrease. 

Financing 

See further discussion of the Partnership s BF Credit Facility in Note 4. Debt in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Partners Equity 

The Partnership completed its best-efforts offering of common units on April 24, 2017. As of the conclusion of the offering on April 24, 2017, the Partnership sold approximately 19.0 million common units for total gross proceeds of 374.2 million and proceeds net of offering costs of 349.6 million. 

Under the agreement with the Dealer Manager, the Dealer Manager received a total of 6 in selling commissions and a marketing expense allowance based on gross proceeds of the common units sold. The Dealer Manager will also be paid a contingent incentive fee, which is a cash payment of up to an amount equal to 4 of gross proceeds of the common units sold based on the performance of the Partnership. Based on the common units sold in the offering, the total contingent fee is a maximum of approximately 15.0 million, which will only be paid if Payout occurs, as defined in Note 6. Capital Contribution and Partners Equity in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Index 

Distributions 

In January 2024, the General Partner declared a special distribution of 0.05 per common unit that reduced the accumulated unpaid distribution total described below; the 0.05 special distribution to limited partners was paid in February 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Partnership paid distributions of 0.35 per common unit and 1.10 per common unit, or 6.6 million and 20.9 million, respectively. In addition, the Partnership declared a monthly cash distribution to its holders of common units of 0.12 per common unit for the month of September 2024. The declared distribution of approximately 2.3 million, which is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Partnership s balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, was paid on October 3, 2024 to the common unit holders on record as of September 30, 2024. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Partnership paid distributions of 0.350000 and 1.075753 per common unit, or 6.6 million and 20.4 million, respectively. 

The Partnership accumulates unpaid distributions based on an annualized return of seven percent (7 ), and all accumulated unpaid distributions are required to be paid before final Payout occurs. As of September 30, 2024, the unpaid Payout Accrual, for the period from March 2020 through November 2021, totaled 2.260447 per common unit, or approximately 43 million. 

Oil and Natural Gas Properties 

The Partnership incurred approximately 23.2 million and 8.8 million in capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Since October 2023, the Partnership has elected to participate in the drilling and completion of 15 new wells, of which all have been completed and turned to sales as of September 30, 2024. The Partnership has an approximate 18 non-operated working interest in these 15 wells, and the Partnership has incurred approximately 20.1 million in capital expenditures to date related to these 15 wells as of September 30, 2024. The Partnership estimates the remaining 6 million to 7 million in capital expenditures to fully pay to complete these 15 wells will be incurred through the fourth quarter of 2024 based on the best available information regarding current capital investment plans from its operators. However, many factors outside the Partnership s control make it difficult to predict when wells will be completed as well as the amount and timing of capital expenditures for 2024 and 2025. Estimated capital expenditures could be significantly different from amounts actually invested. 

In addition to the wells in which the Partnership has already elected to participate, the Partnership anticipates that it may be obligated to invest an additional 80 million to 100 million from 2024 through 2028 to participate in new well development in the Sanish Field without becoming subject to non-consent penalties under the joint operating agreements governing the Sanish Field Assets. 

As described above, the Partnership s liquidity is currently dependent upon cash on-hand, cash from operations and availability under the BF Credit Facility. If the Partnership is not able to generate sufficient cash from operations or there is no availability under its credit facility to fund capital expenditures, it may not be able to complete its capital obligations presented by its operators or participate fully in future wells. If an operator elects to complete drilling or other significant capital expenditure activity and the Partnership is unable to fund the capital expenditures, the General Partner may decide to farmout the well. Also, if a well is proposed under the operating agreement for one of the properties the Partnership owns, the General Partner may elect to non-consent the well. Non-consenting a well will generally cause the Partnership not to be obligated to pay the costs of the well, but the Partnership will not be entitled to the proceeds of production from the well until a penalty is received by the parties that drilled the well. 

Transactions with Related Parties 

The Partnership has, and is expected to continue to engage in, significant transactions with related parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm s length and the results of the Partnership s operations may be different than if conducted with non-related parties. The General Partner s Board of Directors oversees and reviews the Partnership s related party relationships and is required to approve any significant modifications to existing related party transactions, as well as any new significant related party transactions, including approving the new Affiliate Loan.

Subsequent Events 

In October 2024, the Partnership paid approximately 2.3 million, or 0.12 per outstanding common unit, in distributions to its holders of common units. 

In October 2024, the Partnership declared a monthly cash distribution to its holders of common units of 0.11 per outstanding common unit for the month of October 2024. The distribution of approximately 2.1 million was paid on November 5, 2024 to common unit holders on record as of October 31, 2024. 

During November 2024, the Partnership paid off the 1.3 million balance outstanding on the BF Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 using proceeds from its recently-completed wells. The Partnership s full borrowing capacity of 20 million is therefore now available under the BF Credit Facility.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Partnership s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
