For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , equity grants of shares compared to shares in the same period of the prior year were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income because the grant prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and would be anti-dilutive to the computation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in the same period of the prior year, equity grants of shares were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income because the shares would be anti-dilutive to the computation.

 interest was capitalized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. Bank Debt In April 2022, we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank facility, which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility, which is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of . The bank credit facility provides for a maximum facility amount of billion and an initial borrowing base of billion . The bank credit facility also provides for a borrowing base subject to re-determinations, including event-driven unscheduled re-determinations. As of September 30, 2024 , our bank group was composed of financial institutions. The borrowing base may be increased or decreased based on our request and sufficient proved reserves, as determined by the bank group. The commitment amount may be increased to the borrowing base, subject to payment of a mutually acceptable commitment fee to those banks agreeing to participate in the facility increase. Borrowings under the bank credit facility can either be at the alternate base rate (ABR, as defined in the bank credit facility agreement) plus a spread ranging from to or at the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR, as defined in the bank credit facility agreement) plus a spread ranging from to . The applicable spread is dependent upon borrowings relative to the borrowing base. We may elect, from time to time, to convert all or any part of our SOFR loans to base rate loans or to convert all or any part of the base rate loans to SOFR loans. We had outstanding balance on our bank credit facility during first nine months 2024 . The weighted average interest rate was for first nine months 2023 . A commitment fee is paid on the undrawn balance based on an annual rate of to . At September 30, 2024 , the commitment fee was and the interest rate margin was on our ABR loans and on our SOFR loans. As part of our re-determination completed in October 2024, our borrowing base was reaffirmed at billion and our bank commitment was also reaffirmed at billion . On September 30, 2024 , we had outstanding borrowings on our bank credit facility. We had million of undrawn letters of credit, leaving billion of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility. Senior Note Redemptions If we experience a change of control, noteholders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of our senior notes at of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. We currently intend to retire our outstanding long-term debt as it matures, is callable or when market conditions are favorable to repurchase through privately negotiated transactions, open market repurchases, redemptions or otherwise.

million principal amount of our senior notes due 2025 at a discount. We recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt for these transactions of , net of remaining deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we repurchased in the open market million principal amount of our senior notes due 2025 at a discount. We recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of , net of the remaining deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt. Guarantees Range is a holding company that owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. The guarantees by our subsidiaries, which are directly or indirectly owned by Range, of our senior notes and our bank credit facility are full and unconditional and joint and several, subject to certain customary release provisions. The assets, liabilities and results of operations of Range and our guarantor subsidiaries are not materially different than our consolidated financial statements. A subsidiary guarantor may be released from its obligations under the guarantee: in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary guarantor or a sale or other disposition of all the capital stock of the subsidiary guarantor, to any corporation or other person (including an unrestricted subsidiary of Range) by way of merger, consolidation, or otherwise; or 

 if Range designates any restricted subsidiary that is a guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the indenture.

Every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. We recognize all changes in fair value of these derivatives as earnings in derivative fair value income or loss in the periods in which they occur. Basis Swap Contracts In addition to the commodity derivatives described above, at September 30, 2024 , we had natural gas basis swap contracts which lock in the differential between NYMEX Henry Hub and certain of our physical pricing indices. These contracts settle through December 2028 and include a total volume of Mmbtu. The fair value of these contracts was a loss of million at September 30, 2024. Derivative Assets and Liabilities

Our trading securities in Level 1 are exchange-traded and measured at fair value with a market approach using end of period market values. Derivatives in Level 2 are measured at fair value with a market approach using third-party pricing services which have been corroborated with data from active markets or broker quotes. Derivatives in Level 3 are also measured at fair value with a market approach using third-party pricing services which have been corroborated with data from active markets or broker quotes. However, the subjectivity in the volatility factors utilized can cause a significant change in the fair value measurement and is considered a significant unobservable input. As of September 30, 2024, a portion of our natural gas instruments contain swaptions where the counterparty has the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a fixed price swap on a pre-determined date. If exercised, the swaption contract becomes a swap treated consistently with our fixed-price swaps. At September 30, 2024 , we used a weighted average implied volatility of for natural gas swaptions.)

Trading securities. Our trading securities held in the deferred compensation plan are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We elected to adopt the fair value option to simplify our accounting for the investments in our deferred compensation plan. Interest, dividends, and mark-to-market gains or losses are included in deferred compensation plan expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For third quarter 2024 , interest and dividends were and the mark-to-market adjustment was a gain of million compared to interest and dividends of and a mark-to-market loss of million in third quarter 2023. For first nine months 2024 , interest and dividends were and the mark-to-market adjustment was a gain of million compared to interest and dividends of and a mark-to-market gain of million in first nine months 2023.

Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are trade accounts receivable and payable. We believe the carrying values of our current assets and liabilities approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments and (2) our historical and expected incurrence of bad debt expense. Non-financial liabilities initially measured at fair value include asset retirement obligations, operating lease liabilities and the divestiture contract obligation that we incurred in conjunction with the sale of our North Louisiana assets. Concentrations of Credit Risk As of September 30, 2024 , our primary concentrations of credit risk are the risks of not collecting accounts receivable and the risk of a counterparty s failure to perform under derivative obligations. Most of our receivables are from a diverse group of companies, including major energy companies, pipeline companies, local distribution companies, financial institutions and end-users in various industries. Letters of credit or other appropriate assurances are obtained as deemed necessary to limit our risk of loss. Our allowance for uncollectible receivables was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. Our derivative exposure to credit risk is diversified primarily among major investment grade financial institutions, where we have master netting agreements which provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. To manage counterparty risk associated with our derivatives, we select and monitor our counterparties based on our assessment of their financial strength and/or credit ratings. We may also limit the level of exposure with any single counterparty. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are primarily major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial. At September 30, 2024 , our derivative counterparties include financial institutions, of which are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. At September 30, 2024 , our net derivative position includes an aggregate net payable of million from the counterparties not included in our bank credit facility. Allowance for Expected Credit Losses. Each reporting period, we assess the recoverability of material receivables using historical data, current market conditions and reasonable and supported forecasts of future economic conditions to determine their expected collectability. The loss given default method is used when, based on management s judgment, an allowance for expected credit losses should be accrued on a material receivable to reflect the net amount to be collected.

active equity-based stock plans: our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity-Based Incentive Compensation Plan and our Amended and Restated 2019 Equity-Based Compensation Plan. Under these plans, various awards may be issued to non-employee directors and employees pursuant to decisions of the Compensation Committee, which is composed of only non-employee, independent directors. Total Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation represents amortization of restricted stock and performance units.

The mark-to-market adjustment of the liability related to the vested restricted stock Liability Awards held in our deferred compensation plan is directly tied to the change in our stock price and not directly related to the functional expenses and, therefore, is not allocated to the functional categories above. Restricted Stock Equity Awards We grant restricted stock units and restricted stock under our equity-based stock compensation plans to our employees, which we refer to as restricted stock Equity Awards. The Equity Awards generally vest over a period and typically are contingent on the recipient s continued employment. The grant date fair value of the Equity Awards is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. In 2023, we began granting restricted stock (previously placed in our deferred compensation plan) that vests at the end of a period for certain officer grants and at the end of a period for non-employee directors. Vesting is also typically based upon the officer's continued employment with us. Prior to vesting, recipients of restricted stock typically earn dividends payable in cash upon vesting but they have no voting rights prior to vesting. The Equity Awards are not issued until such time as they are vested and grantees receive the awards in stock. We recorded compensation expense for these outstanding Equity Awards of million in first nine months 2024 compared to million in the same period of 2023. Restricted Stock Liability Awards The Compensation Committee also grants restricted stock to certain employees and non-employee directors of the board of directors as part of their compensation. Upon grant of these restricted shares, which we refer to as restricted stock Liability Awards, these shares are placed in our deferred compensation plan (see further discussion below) and, upon vesting, withdrawals are allowed in cash or in stock. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is typically at the end of three years for employee grants and at the end of a one-year period for non-employee directors. In 2023, the number of shares granted into our deferred compensation plan was reduced in favor of restricted stock Equity Awards. All Liability Awards are issued at prevailing market prices at the time of the grant and the vesting is typically based upon an employee s continued employment with us. Prior to vesting, Liability Award recipients typically earn dividends payable in cash upon vesting but they have no individual voting rights prior to vesting. These Liability Awards are classified as a liability and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period. This mark-to-market amount is reported in deferred compensation plan expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We recorded compensation expense for these Liability Awards of in first nine months 2024 compared to million in first nine months 2023. Stock-Based Performance Awards - (PSUs) We have granted types of performance share awards: one based on performance conditions measured against internal performance metrics and based on market conditions measured based on Range s performance relative to a predetermined peer group (TSR Awards). In first nine months 2024, only TSR Awards were granted. Each unit granted represents share of our common stock. These units are settled in stock and the amount of the payout is based on the vesting percentage, which can range from to and (1) the internal performance metrics achieved, which is determined by the Compensation Committee and (2) for our TSR Awards, the value of our common stock compared to our peers. Dividend equivalents accrue during the performance period and are paid in stock at the end of the performance period. The performance period is .

performance period. The performance metrics are set by the Compensation Committee. If the performance metric for the applicable performance period is not met, that portion is considered forfeited and there is an adjustment to the expense recorded. We recorded compensation expense associated with the prior year grants of in first nine months 2024 compared to expense of million in first nine months 2023. TSR Awards. These awards are earned, or not earned, based on the comparative performance of Range s common stock measured against a predetermined group of companies in the peer group over a performance period. The fair value of the TSR Awards is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model which utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. The fair value is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the three-year performance period. Expected volatilities utilized in the model were estimated using a combination of a historical period consistent with the remaining performance period of three years and option-implied volatilities. The risk-free interest rate was based on the United States Treasury rate for a term commensurate with the life of the grant. We recorded compensation expense of million in first nine months 2024 compared to million in the same period of 2023 . Fair value is amortized over the performance period with no adjustment to the expense recorded for actual targets achieved.

Deferred Compensation Plan Our deferred compensation plan gives non-employee directors and officers the ability to defer all or a portion of their salaries, bonuses or director fees and invest in Range common stock or make other investments at the individual s discretion. Range provides a partial matching contribution to participating officers which generally vests at the end of . The assets of the plan are held in a grantor trust, which we refer to as the Rabbi Trust, and are therefore available to satisfy the claims of our general creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. Our common stock held in the Rabbi Trust is treated as a liability award as employees are allowed to take withdrawals from the Rabbi Trust either in cash or in Range stock. The liability for the vested portion of the stock held in the Rabbi Trust is reflected as deferred compensation liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is adjusted to fair value each reporting period by a charge or credit to deferred compensation plan expense on our consolidated statements of income. The assets of the Rabbi Trust, other than our common stock, are invested in marketable securities and reported at their market value as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The deferred compensation liability reflects the vested market value of the marketable securities and Range stock held in the Rabbi Trust.

Stock Repurchase Program In 2019, the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program which was increased in size in 2022. At September 30, 2024 , we had a remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately billion of our common stock. Under this program, we may repurchase shares in open market transactions, from time to time, in accordance with applicable SEC rules and federal securities laws. Purchases under the program are made at our discretion and may change based upon market conditions. In third quarter 2024, we repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of million, which includes the repurchase of million shares) traded in June, but settled in July.

In first nine months 2024, we also recorded a net adjustment of million to decrease the obligation mainly due to a decrease in forecasted electricity costs. In first nine months 2023, we also recorded a net adjustment of million to increase the obligation for an increase in forecasted rates due to inflation. The estimated discounted divestiture contract obligation was million at September 30, 2024. In second quarter 2020, we negotiated capacity releases on certain transportation pipelines in Pennsylvania effective May 31, 2020 and extending through the remainder of the contract.

There were significant changes to firm transportation, gathering and processing minimum commitments in the second or third quarter 2024. In addition to the above, we entered into amendments of existing contracts that will expand gathering and processing capacity by Mmcf/day and transportation capacity by Mmbtu/day, contingent on the completion of construction of the relevant facilities and expected to be in service in 2026. We have a related contingent minimum commitment for the de-ethanization capacity associated with this processing expansion. Beginning on the in-service date this capacity will total bbls/day, increasing by bbls/day after one year of service, and continues through the end of the agreement. We also entered into a new contract for propane export terminal capacity that is contingent on the completion of construction of the relevant facilities and is expected to be in service in 2026. This capacity will be bbls/day for the first year and increases to bbls/day for the remainder of the term.

ITE M 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANA LYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Overview of Our Business 
 We are an independent natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and liquids properties in the Appalachian region of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on a geographical or an area-by-area basis. 
 Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through returns-focused development of properties. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to generate consistent cash flows from reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions and divestitures. Currently, our investment portfolio is focused on high-quality natural gas assets in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce these reserves. 
 Commodity prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. We believe we are well-positioned to manage challenges during a low commodity price environment and that we can endure the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by: 
 exercising discipline in our capital investments; 

optimizing drilling, completion and operational efficiencies; 

maintaining a competitive cost structure; 

managing price risk through the hedging of our production; and 

managing our balance sheet. 

Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect: 
 our revenues, profitability and cash flow; 

the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we can economically produce; 

the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil shown as proved reserves; 

the amount of cash flow available to us for reinvestment; and 

our ability to borrow and raise additional capital, if needed. 

We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1. 
 Market Conditions 
 We believe we are positioned for sustainable long-term success. We continue to monitor the impact of the actions of OPEC and other large hydrocarbon producing nations, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, hostilities in the Middle East, global inventories of oil and gas, future monetary and fiscal policy and governmental policies aimed at transitioning towards lower carbon energy, and we expect prices for the commodities we produce to remain volatile given the complex dynamics of supply and demand that exist in the global energy markets. In first quarter 2024, natural gas prices declined primarily due to mild winter weather, but prices partially recovered in third quarter 2024 based on signs of lower industry well completion activity and supply declines, along with growth in demand for natural gas fired electricity generation. Longer term natural gas futures prices remain stronger based on market expectations that associated gas-related activity in oil basins and dry gas basin activity will show modest rates of growth compared with the past due to infrastructure constraints, moderated reinvestment rates and core inventory exhaustion. In addition, the global energy crisis experienced in recent years further highlighted the low cost and low emissions shale gas resource base in North America, supporting continued strong structural demand growth for United States liquefied natural gas exports, domestic industrial gas demand and power generation. Other factors such as geopolitical disruptions, supply chain disruptions, cost inflation, concerns over a potential economic recession and the pace and changes in global monetary policy may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs and oil. We continue to assess and monitor the impact and consequences of these factors on our operations. 
 Commodity prices have remained volatile. Benchmarks for natural gas and NGLs decreased in third quarter 2024 and first nine months 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. As a result, we experienced decreases in our price realizations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Despite overall year-to-date lower prices, we continue to focus on creating long-term value for our stockholders along with positioning ourselves to be a responsible and reliable supplier of natural gas and NGLs.

 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Overview of Third Quarter 2024 Results 
 During third quarter 2024, we recognized net income of 50.7 million, or 0.21 per diluted common share compared to net income of 49.4 million, or 0.20 per diluted common share during third quarter 2023. The higher net income in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 is primarily due to higher production slightly offset by lower realized prices. 
 In third quarter 2024, we experienced an increase in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 4 increase in production. Net realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs paid by us) when compared to the same quarter of 2023 remained flat. Daily production averaged 2.2 Bcfe in third quarter 2024 and 2.1 Bcfe in the same period of 2023. 
 Our third quarter 2024 financial and operating performance included the following results: 
 revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil increased 1 from the same period of 2023 due to a 4 increase in production volumes, partially offset by a 3 decrease in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives); 

revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil (including cash settlements on our derivatives) increased 7 from the same period of 2023; 

direct operating expense per mcfe was 0.12 in third quarter 2024 compared to 0.12 in the same period of 2023; 

transportation, gathering, processing and compression per mcfe was 1.51 in third quarter 2024 compared to 1.42 in the same period of 2023, primarily due to an increase in NGLs volumes and prices; 

general and administrative expense per mcfe was 0.20 in third quarter 2024 compared to 0.20 in the same period of 2023; and 

interest expense decreased 4 from the same period of 2023 due to lower debt balances. 

Third quarter 2024 also included the following highlights to enhance our balance sheet, return capital to investors and preserve liquidity: 
 paid 19.3 million of dividends, or 0.08 per share; 

repurchased 24.0 million of our common stock and settled 9.9 million of our common stock that was traded in June 2024 ; 

repurchased in the open market 3.0 million face value of our 4.875 senior notes due 2025 at a discount; and 

maintained substantial liquidity with the accumulation of cash on hand of 277.5 million along with 1.3 billion available under our credit facility. 

We generated 245.9 million of cash from operating activities in third quarter 2024, an increase of 95.7 million from third quarter 2023, which reflects the impact of higher working capital.

Overview of First Nine Months 2024 Results 
 During first nine months 2024, we recognized net income of 171.5 million, or 0.70 per diluted common share compared to net income of 561.1 million, or 2.27 per diluted common share during the same period of 2023. The lower net income in first nine months 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 is primarily due to lower derivative fair value income (non-cash fair value adjustment related to our derivatives) combined with lower realized prices slightly offset by higher production. 
 For first nine months 2024, we experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 5 decrease in net realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs paid by us) when compared to the same period of 2023. Daily production averaged 2.2 Bcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 Bcfe in the same period of the prior year. 
 Our first nine months 2024 financial and operating performance included the following results: 
 revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil decreased 9 from the same period of 2023 with an 11 decrease in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) slightly offset by higher production volumes; 

revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil (including cash settlements on our derivatives) increased 1 from the same period of 2023; 

direct operating expense per mcfe was 0.12 in first nine months 2024 compared to 0.13 in the same period of 2023 primarily due to lower workover costs along with lower water hauling costs; 

transportation, gathering, processing and compression per mcfe was 1.48 in first nine months 2024 compared to 1.44 in the same period of 2023 primarily due to an increase in NGLs volumes and prices; 

general and administrative expense per mcfe was 0.21 in first nine months 2024 compared to 0.21 in the same period of 2023; and 

interest expense decreased 5 from the same period of 2023 due to lower debt balances. 

First nine months 2024 also included the following highlights to enhance our balance sheet, return capital to investors and preserve liquidity: 
 paid 58.1 million of dividends, or 0.24 per share; 

repurchased 44.1 million of our common stock; 

repurchased in the open market 70.2 million face value of our 4.875 senior notes due 2025 at a discount; and 

maintained substantial liquidity with the accumulation of cash on hand of 277.5 million along with 1.3 billion available under our credit facility. 

We generated 726.6 million of cash from operating activities in first nine months 2024, a decrease of 25.2 million from first nine months 2023, which reflects the impact of lower realized prices. 
 Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations 
 Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. Our revenues are generally recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Oil and NGLs volumes are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices. 

Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) during third quarter 2024 was 1.67 per mcfe compared to 1.67 per mcfe in third quarter 2023. Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) during first nine months 2024 was 1.79 per mcfe compared to 1.89 per mcfe in first nine months 2023. We believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense. Our average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Our average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include derivative settlements or third-party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Our average realized prices (including derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.

Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials and gains or losses realized from our basis hedging. The prices we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location, relative quality and other factors.

Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense was 306.2 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 277.2 million in third quarter 2023. These third-party costs are higher in third quarter 2024 when compared to third quarter 2023 primarily due to an increase in NGLs volumes and prices. 
 Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense was 878.5 million in first nine months 2024 compared to 830.9 million in the same period of the prior year. These third-party costs are higher in first nine months 2024 when compared to the same period of 2023 due to an increase in NGLs volumes and prices. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation expenses paid by Range). The following table summarizes transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 on a per mcf and per barrel basis (in thousands, except for costs per unit):

Derivative fair value income was 47.1 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 38.4 million in third quarter 2023. Derivative fair value income was 110.5 million in first nine months 2024 compared to 530.1 million in the same period of the prior year. All of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment can result in more volatility of our revenues as the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions is included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate potentially lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate potentially higher future wellhead revenues. The following table summarizes the impact of our commodity derivatives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

(a) 
 Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represent the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of income. This also includes the change in fair value of our divestiture contingent consideration.

Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in third quarter 2024 was 34.6 million compared to 44.6 million in third quarter 2023, which is the result of lower broker sales volumes (volumes not related to our production) combined with lower broker sales prices. We continue to optimize our transportation portfolio using these volumes. Other revenue in third quarter 2024 also includes 3.2 million of interest income compared to 1.3 million in the same period of the prior year. 
 Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue was 101.2 million in first nine months 2024 compared to 171.6 million in first nine months 2023, which is the result of lower broker sales volumes combined with lower broker sales prices. Other revenue in first nine months 2024 also includes 9.5 million of interest income compared to 4.0 million in the same period of the prior year. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 also includes 5.1 million in make-whole payments. See also Brokered natural gas and marketing expense below for more information on our net brokered margin. 
 Operating Costs per Mcfe 
 We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production or per mcfe basis. The following table presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Direct operating expense was 25.3 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 22.6 million in third quarter 2023. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring workover costs and repair-related expenses. Our direct operating costs increased in third quarter 2024 primarily due to higher water hauling costs, pumping expenses and contract labor and service expenses. We incurred 690,000 of workover costs in third quarter 2024 compared to 603,000 in third quarter 2023. 
 Direct operating expense was 70.2 million in first nine months 2024 compared to 73.4 million in the same period of the prior year. Our direct operating costs decreased in first nine months 2024 when compared to the same period of the prior year due to lower workover costs and lower water hauling costs. We incurred 2.2 million of workover costs in first nine months 2024 compared to 4.3 million of workover costs in first nine months 2023. These costs are expected to enhance production from existing wells. The following table summarizes direct operating expense per mcfe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Taxes other than income expense is predominately comprised of the Pennsylvania impact fee which is paid based on market commodity prices. In 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an "impact fee" which functions as a tax on unconventional natural gas and oil production from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. This impact fee was 4.9 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 4.5 million in third quarter 2023. This impact fee was 15.3 million in first nine months 2024 compared to 18.0 million in first nine months 2023, which reflects lower natural gas prices. The impact fee is based on drilling activities and is adjusted based on prevailing natural gas prices. This category also includes franchise, real estate and other applicable taxes. The following table summarizes taxes other than income per mcfe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

General and administrative (G A) expense was 41.5 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 38.1 million in third quarter 2023. The third quarter 2024 increase of 3.4 million when compared to the same period of 2023 is primarily due to aggregate impacts of cost inflation. 
 G A expense for first nine months 2024 was 125.6 million compared to 120.8 million in the same period of 2023. The increase of 4.8 million is primarily due to aggregate impacts of cost inflation.

The decrease in interest expense for third quarter 2024 from the same period of 2023 was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances. We had no debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for third quarter 2024 or the same period of 2023. 
 The decrease in interest expense for first nine months 2024 from the same period of 2023 was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances. We had no debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for first nine months 2024 compared to a 10.7 million average debt balance for first nine months 2023 and the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility was 8.4 in first nine months 2023. 
 Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD A) expense was 91.1 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 87.6 million in third quarter 2023. This increase is due to slightly higher production volumes. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD A expense, was 0.44 per mcfe in third quarter 2024 compared to 0.44 per mcfe in third quarter 2023. 
 DD A expense was 265.9 million in first nine months 2024 compared to 259.2 million in the same period of 2023. This increase is due to a slight increase in production volumes. Depletion expense was 0.44 per mcfe in first nine months 2024 compared to 0.44 in the same period of 2023. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs.

Other Operating Expenses 
 Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, exit costs, deferred compensation plan expense and gain on early extinguishment of debt. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants and performance units.

Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties expense was 4.7 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 11.0 million in third quarter 2023. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was 8.6 million in first nine months 2024 compared to 44.3 million in the same period of 2023. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties for third quarter 2024 and first nine months 2024 decreased when compared to the same periods of 2023 due to lower expected lease expirations in Pennsylvania. When we do not intend to drill on a property prior to expiration, we have allowed acreage to expire and we expect to allow acreage to expire in the future. However, we also believe acreage needed for our future development plans can be leased again.

Exit costs were 7.6 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 10.7 million in third quarter 2023. In third quarter 2024, we recorded 9.7 million accretion expense primarily related to retained liabilities for certain gathering, transportation and processing obligations extending through 2030 compared to accretion expense of 10.7 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Third quarter 2024 includes an adjustment of 2.1 million to decrease this obligation mainly due to a decrease in forecasted electricity costs. 
 Exit costs were 28.1 million in first nine months 2024 compared to 71.7 million in first nine months 2023. We recorded accretion expense of 30.2 million in first nine months 2024 compared to accretion expense of 31.9 million in the same period of 2023. First nine months 2024 includes an adjustment of 2.1 million to decrease this obligation mainly due to a decrease in forecasted electricity costs compared to adjustments of 39.8 million in first nine months 2023 to increase this obligation primarily for an increase in forecasted rates due to inflation. 
 Deferred compensation plan was a gain of 1.9 million in third quarter 2024 compared to a loss of 9.0 million in third quarter 2023. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense based on the number of vested shares in the plan at the time. Our stock price decreased from 33.53 at June 30, 2024 to 30.76 at September 30, 2024. In the same period of the prior year our stock price increased from 29.40 at June 30, 2023 to 32.41 at September 30, 2023. 
 During first nine months 2024, deferred compensation plan expense was a loss of 5.7 million compared to a loss of 29.5 million in the same period of 2023. Our stock price increased from 30.44 at December 31, 2023 to 30.76 at September 30, 2024. In the same period of the prior year, our stock price increased from 25.02 at December 31, 2022 to 32.41 at September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax expense was 15.6 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 15.7 million in third quarter 2023. Income tax expense was 15.1 million in first nine months 2024 compared to an 152.3 million in the same period of 2023. The 2024 and 2023 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rates due to state income taxes, tax credits, equity compensation and the limitation of our executive compensation expense. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, net income, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, payment of dividends and funding of share or debt repurchases. Commodity prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. Our top priorities for using cash provided by operations are to fund our capital budget program, debt repayments and return capital to stockholders. We currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to execute our business plan for the foreseeable future and across a wide range of commodity price environments. We continue to manage the duration and level of our drilling and completion commitments in order to maintain flexibility with regard to our activity level and capital expenditures.

Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash flows provided from operating activities in first nine months 2024 were 726.6 million compared to 751.8 million in first nine months 2023. Cash provided from operating activities is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities from first nine months 2023 to first nine months 2024 reflects lower realized prices. As of September 30, 2024, we have hedged more than 50 of our projected natural gas production for the remainder of 2024. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first nine months 2024 was a negative 49.8 million compared to a negative 54.9 million for first nine months 2023. 
 Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Additions to natural gas properties for first nine months 2024 were consistent with expectations relative to our announced 2024 capital budget. 
 Repayment of senior notes for first nine months 2024 includes the repurchase and settlement of 70.2 million principal amount of our 4.875 senior notes due 2025 at a discount. 
 Treasury stock purchases for first nine months 2024 include the repurchase and settlement of 1.4 million shares for a total of 44.1 million as part of our previously announced stock repurchase program. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our main sources of liquidity are cash on hand, internally generated cash flow from operations, capital market transactions and our bank credit facility. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.6 billion of liquidity consisting of 277.5 million of cash on hand and 1.3 billion of availability under our bank credit facility. Our borrowing base can be adjusted as a result of changes in commodity prices, acquisitions or divestitures of proved properties or financing activities. We may draw on our bank credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements. 
 We expect our 2024 capital program to be funded by cash flows from operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 726.6 million of cash flows from operating activities. 
 Bank Credit Facility 
 Our bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility and we maintained a borrowing base of 3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of 1.5 billion. We have undrawn letters of credit of 169.4 million as of September 30, 2024, which reduce our borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility. 
 The borrowing base is subject to regular, semi-annual re-determinations and is dependent on a number of factors but primarily the lenders' assessment of our future cash flows. Our scheduled borrowing base re-determination was completed in October 2024 with our borrowing base and lender commitments reaffirmed. We currently must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including limiting dividend payments, debt incurrence and requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios (as defined in our bank credit facility agreement). We were in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 Capital Requirements 
 We use cash for the development, exploration and acquisition of natural gas properties and for the payment of gathering, transportation and processing costs, operating, general and administrative costs, taxes and debt obligations, including interest, dividends and share repurchases. Expenditures for the development, exploration and acquisition of natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. During first nine months 2024, we used operating cash flows to fund 478.4 million of capital expenditures as reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows within investing activities. The amount of our future capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors including our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, infrastructure availability, supply and demand fundamentals and our ability to execute our development program. In addition, the impact of commodity prices on investment opportunities, the availability of capital and the timing and results of our development activities may lead to changes in funding requirements for future development. We periodically review our budget to assess changes in current and projected cash flows, debt requirements and other factors. 
 We may from time to time repurchase or redeem all or portions of our outstanding debt securities for cash, through exchanges for other securities or a combination of both. Such repurchases or redemptions may be made in open market transactions and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Our next significant long-term debt maturity is in the principal amount of 618.1 million due 2025 and is therefore classified as current on the balance sheet. 

32 

Cash Dividend Payments 
 On August 30, 2024, our board of directors approved a dividend of 0.08 per share payable on September 27, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 13, 2024. The determination of the amount of future dividends, if any, to be declared and paid is at the sole discretion of the board of directors and primarily depends on cash flow, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 Our total remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately 1.0 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Other Sources of Liquidity 
 We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, have the future ability to sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. 
 Cash Contractual Obligations 
 Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation, processing and gathering commitments including the divestiture contractual commitment. See Note 16 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled "Commitments and Contingencies" for more information on commitments. 
 Interest Rates 
 At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.7 billion of debt outstanding which bore interest at fixed rates averaging 6.0 . We had no variable rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments, some of which are described above under Cash Contractual Obligations. 
 Inflation and Changes in Prices 
 Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation and we expect costs for the remainder of 2024 to continue to be a function of supply and demand. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain sections of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business. These statements typically contain words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "targets," "plans," "estimates," "predicts," "may," "should," "would" or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us. While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate. All comments concerning our expectations for future revenues and operating results are based on our current forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future events. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For additional risk factors affecting our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT I VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term "market risk" refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated. 
 Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide partial price protection. These arrangements can limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and regional index prices for North American natural gas production. However, natural gas and NGLs prices are becoming global commodities similar to oil. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Changes in natural gas prices affect us more than changes in oil prices because approximately 64 of our December 31, 2023 proved reserves are natural gas and 2 of proved reserves are oil. In addition, a portion of our NGLs, which are 34 of proved reserves, are also impacted by changes in oil prices. At times, we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program can also include collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. Our program may also include a three-way collar which is a combination of three options. We have also entered into natural gas derivative instruments containing a fixed price swap and a sold option (which we refer to as a swaption). At September 30, 2024, our derivative program includes swaps, collars, three-way collars and swaptions. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX for natural gas and oil or Mont Belvieu for NGLs, approximated a net unrealized gain of 207.4 million as of September 30, 2024. These contracts expire monthly through December 2027. At September 30, 2024, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are separately discussed below:

(a) 
 We also sold natural gas swaptions of 20,000 Mmbtu/day for calendar year 2026 at a weighted average price of 4.05/Mmbtu that expire in October 2024 and 30,000 MMbtu/day for 2027 at a weighted average price of 4.10 Mmbtu/day that expire in October 2024. The fair value of these swaptions at September 30, 2024 was a net derivative liability of 9,000. 

34 

We believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal, particularly for propane. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and international markets. If we are not able to sell or store NGLs, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. 
 The Appalachian region has limited local demand and infrastructure to accommodate ethane. We have agreements where we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area. We cannot ensure that these facilities will remain available. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have done in the past, purchase or divert natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas. 
 Other Commodity Risk 
 We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. Therefore, in addition to the swaps, collars, three-way collars and swaptions discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX Henry Hub price because of basis adjustments, relative quality and other factors. Basis swap agreements effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the natural gas basis swaps was a loss of 16.9 million at September 30, 2024, and they settle through December 2028. 
 Commodity Sensitivity Analysis 
 The following table shows the fair value of our derivatives and the hypothetical changes in fair value that would result from a 10 and a 25 change in commodity prices at September 30, 2024. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):

Our commodity-based derivative contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified primarily among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At September 30, 2024, our derivative counterparties include fifteen financial institutions, of which ten are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are primarily major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total debt of approximately 1.7 billion. All of our outstanding debt is based on fixed interest rates and, as a result, we do not have significant exposure to movements in market interest rates. Our bank credit facility provides for variable interest rate borrowings; however, we did not have any borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024.

IT EM 4. CONTROLS A ND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
