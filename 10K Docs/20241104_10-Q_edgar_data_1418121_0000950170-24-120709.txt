As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned hotels with an aggregate of guest rooms located in states and the District of Columbi a, including hotel with guest rooms classified as held for sale, which is expected to be sold to an unrelated party in November 2024. In May 2023, the Company entered into an operating lease for an initial term with a third-party hotel operator at its independent boutique hotel in New York, New York for all hotel operations of the hotel s guest rooms non-hotel property ). Lease revenue from this property is recorded in other revenue in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. As a result of the lease and transfer of possession to the operator, this property has been excluded from the Company s hotel and guest room counts since May 2023. As a result of the operator's failure to make lease payments, the Company has commenced legal proceedings to remove the operator from possession of the hotel. The Company intends to enforce its rights under the lease and transition management of the hotel to a third-party manager, however, the removal process is still ongoing and the timing of the resolution of this matter and the transition of management operations cannot be predicted at this time. The Company leases all of its hotels to its wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary (or a subsidiary thereof) under a master hotel lease agreement.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company utilized proceeds from the sale of hotels and borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) to purchase the Washington, D.C. and Madison, Wisconsin hotels. The Company utilized its available cash on hand, net proceeds from sales of shares under the ATM Program (as defined below) and availability under its Revolving Credit Facility to purchase the properties acquired in 2023. The acquisitions of these properties were accounted for as acquisitions of asset groups, whereby costs incurred to effect the acquisitions (which were not significant) were capitalized as part of the cost of the assets acquired. For the two hotels acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of revenue and operating income included in the Company s consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2024 was approximately million and million, respectively. Purchase Contract Commitments As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding contract, which was entered into during May 2023, for the potential purchase of a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee for an expected purchase price of approximately million. The hotel is under development and is currently planned to be completed and opened for business in late 2025, as a 260-guest-room Motto. As of September 30, 2024, a million contract deposit (refundable if the seller does not meet its obligations under the contract) had been paid. If the closing occurs, the Company plans to utilize its available cash or borrowings, including borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities available at closing, to purchase the hotel under contract. Although the Company is working towards acquiring this hotel, there are a number of conditions to closing that have not yet been satisfied, and there can be no assurance that closing on this hotel will occur under the outstanding purchase contract. If the seller meets all of the conditions to closing, the Company is obligated to specifically perform under the purchase contract and acquire this hotel. As this hotel is under development, at this time, the seller has not met all of the conditions to closing. 

 of its hotels for a gross sales price of million. Since the buyer under the contract had completed its due diligence and had made a non-refundable deposit, as of September 30, 2024, the Company classified the hotel as assets held for sale in its consolidated balance sheet at its estimated fair value less costs to sell, which, as described below, was based on the contracted sales price, resulting in an impairment loss during the third quarter of 2024. The Company expects to complete the sale of the hotel in November 2024.

hotels to two unrelated parties for a combined gross sales price of approximately million, resulting in a combined gain on the sales of approximately million, net of transaction costs, which is included in the Company s consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The hotels had a total carrying value of approximately million at their respective times of sale. There were dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2023 .

Excluding gains on sale of real estate, the Company s consolidated statements of operations include an operating loss of approximately million and operating income of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, relating to the results of operations of the hotels noted above (the hotel classified as held for sale at September 30, 2024, and the hotels sold in 2024) for the period of ownership. The sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results; therefore, the operating results for the period of ownership of these properties are included in income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , as applicable. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the two hotels in February 2024 was used to complete a like-kind exchange, in accordance with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the acquisition of the AC Hotel in Washington, D.C. as discussed above in Note 2, which resulted in the deferral of taxable gains of million . The net proceeds from the sale of the hotel in the second quarter of 2024 were used for general corporate purposes. Hotel Sale Contracts and Loss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets During the third quarter of 2024, the Company identified indicators of impairment at properties, resulting in a combined loss on impairment for the period of million. One property, which is held for sale as of September 30, 2024, was identified for potential sale in August 2024, and the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an unrelated party for the sale of the hotel for a gross sales price of million. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately million for this property in the third quarter of 2024, to adjust the carrying value of the hotel to its estimated fair value less cost to sell, which was based on the contracted sales price, a Level 2 input under the fair value hierarchy. The Company plans to complete the sale of the hotel in November 2024. The second property was identified for potential sale, and the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an unrelated party in October 2024 for the sale of the hotel. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately million for this property in the third quarter of 2024, to adjust the carrying value of the hotel to its estimated fair value less cost to sell, which was based on the contracted sales price, a Level 2 input under the fair value hierarchy. See Note 9 for additional information related to the purchase and sale agreement entered in October 2024.

Both the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Company s debt (as discussed above) are net of unamortized debt issuance costs related to term loans, senior notes and mortgage debt for each specific year. Derivative Instruments Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk on variable-rate debt. Throughout the terms of these interest rate swaps, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate of interest equal to the 

 14 

SOFR spread adjustment . The swaps are designed to effectively fix the interest payments on variable-rate debt instruments. These swap instruments are recorded at fair value and, if in an asset position, are included in other assets, net, and, if in a liability position, are included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the Company s interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts, which is considered a Level 2 measurement under the fair value hierarchy. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of statements that include phrases such as may, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, project, target, goal, plan, should, will, predict, potential, outlook, strategy, and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the information contained in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Overview 
 The Company is a Virginia corporation that has elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is self-advised and invests in income-producing real estate, primarily in the lodging sector, in the U.S. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned 224 hotels with an aggregate of 30,068 guest rooms located in urban, high-end suburban and developing markets throughout 37 states and the District of Columbia, including one hotel with 90 guest rooms classified as held for sale, which is expected to be sold to an unrelated party in November 2024. Substantially all of the Company s hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands. The hotels are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 16 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The Company s common shares are listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol APLE. 
 Recent Hotel Portfolio Activities 
 The Company continually monitors market conditions and attempts to maximize shareholder value by investing in properties that it believes provide superior value over the long term. Consistent with this strategy and the Company s focus on investing in rooms-focused hotels, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired two hotels for an aggregate purchase price of 196.3 million: an existing 234-guest-room AC Hotel in Washington, D.C. and a 262-guest-room Embassy Suites in Madison, Wisconsin that was purchased at the completion of development. The Company utilized proceeds from the sale of three properties and borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility to fund these recently completed acquisitions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had one outstanding contract, which was entered into during May 2023, for the potential purchase of a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee for an expected purchase price of approximately 98.2 million. The hotel is 
 20 

under development and is currently planned to be completed and opened for business in late 2025, as a 260-guest-room Motto. As of September 30, 2024, a 1.1 million contract deposit (refundable if the seller does not meet its obligations under the contract) had been paid. If the closing occurs, the Company plans to utilize its available cash or borrowings, including borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities available at closing, to purchase the hotel under contract. Although the Company is working towards acquiring this hotel, there are a number of conditions to closing that have not yet been satisfied, and there can be no assurance that closing on this hotel will occur under the outstanding purchase contract. If the seller meets all of the conditions to closing, the Company is obligated to specifically perform under the purchase contract and acquire this hotel. As this hotel is under development, at this time, the seller has not met all of the conditions to closing. 
 For its existing portfolio, the Company monitors each property s profitability, market conditions and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by disposing of properties when it believes that superior value can be provided from the sale of the property. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold three hotels in two separate transactions with unrelated parties for a combined gross sales price of approximately 40.6 million, resulting in a combined gain on the sales of approximately 18.2 million, net of transaction costs. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of two of the hotels to complete a like-kind exchange, in accordance with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the acquisition of the AC Hotel in Washington, D.C., which was completed in March 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an outstanding contract to sell one of its hotels for a gross sales price of approximately 3.1 million, which is expected to be completed in November 2024. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October 2024, the Company entered into three purchase and sale agreements with unrelated parties for the sale of three hotels for a combined gross sales price of 28.0 million. The Company expects to complete the sales of these hotels in late 2024 or early 2025. There are many conditions to closing on the sales of these hotels that have not yet been satisfied, and there can be no assurance that closings on the sales of these hotels will occur under the outstanding purchase and sale agreements. 
 See Note 2 titled Investment in Real Estate and Note 3 titled Assets Held for Sale and Dispositions in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional information concerning these transactions. 
 In May 2023, the Company entered into an operating lease for an initial 15-year term with a third-party hotel operator at its independent boutique hotel in New York, New York for all hotel operations of the hotel s 210 guest rooms. Lease revenue from this property is recorded in other revenue in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. As a result of the lease and transfer of possession to the operator, this property has been excluded from the Company s hotel and guest room counts since May 2023. Results of the hotel operations for this property are included only for the period prior to the lease agreement becoming effective in May 2023. As a result of the operator's failure to make lease payments, the Company has commenced legal proceedings to remove the operator from possession of the hotel. The Company intends to enforce its rights under the lease and transition management of the hotel to a third-party manager, however, the removal process is still ongoing and the timing of the resolution of this matter and the transition of management operations cannot be predicted at this time. 
 Hotel Operations 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned 224 hotels, including one hotel classified as held for sale, with a total of 30,068 guest rooms as compared to 220 hotels with a total of 28,929 guest rooms as of September 30, 2023. Results of operations are included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during the current reporting period and prior year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired two properties, including one existing hotel acquired on March 25, 2024 and one hotel acquired upon the completion of development on June 20, 2024. The Company sold three properties, two on February 9, 2024 and one on May 21, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company acquired one existing hotel on June 30, 2023 and did not dispose of any properties. 
 In evaluating financial condition and operating performance, the most important indicators on which the Company focuses are revenue measurements, such as average occupancy, average daily rate ADR and revenue per available room RevPAR ), and expenses, such as hotel operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses described below. RevPAR and operating results may be impacted by regional and local economies and local regulations as well as changes in lodging demand due to macroeconomic factors including inflationary pressures, higher energy prices or a recessionary environment.

As discussed above, hotel performance is impacted by many factors, including the economic conditions in the U.S. as well as each individual locality. Economic indicators in the U.S. have generally been stable. As a result, the Company s Comparable Hotels and Same Store Hotels revenue and operating results have generally remained unchanged during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is consistent with the overall lodging industry. The Company expects its RevPAR growth and operating results for its Comparable Hotels for the full year of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, to be similar to its performance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with modest growth and consistent trends in both business transient and leisure demand. 
 Revenues 
 The Company s principal source of revenue is hotel revenue consisting of room, food and beverage, and other related revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had total revenue of 378.8 million and 358.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company had total revenue of 1.1 billion and 1.0 billion, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 77.0 and 77.3 , ADR of 162.66 and 160.78 and RevPAR of 125.30 and 124.25. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 76.4 and 75.9 , ADR of 160.19 and 159.37 and RevPAR of 122.32 and 120.98. ADR is calculated as room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold, and RevPAR is calculated as occupancy multiplied by ADR. 
 Compared to the same periods in 2023, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, occupancy remained relatively flat while ADR increased by 2.0 and 1.4 respectively, resulting in increases of 1.8 and 2.0 , respectively, in RevPAR. Revenue growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023, was led by the additional hotels acquired in 2023 and 2024 and was supported by increased strength in business transient demand for the portfolio. Markets with significant above average growth in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, for the Company included Chicago, Cape Canaveral, Anchorage, Houston and Omaha. Leisure demand, which has produced the strongest rate growth post pandemic, showed signs of increased rate sensitivity in some markets during the quarter, and midweek rate growth came at lower absolute rates than those achieved on weekends, with the combined effect weighing on overall ADR growth for the quarter. Future revenues could be negatively impacted by, among other things, historical seasonal trends, deterioration of consumer sentiment, a recessionary macroeconomic environment or inflationary pressures. 
 Hotel Operating Expense 
 Hotel operating expense consists of direct room operating expense, hotel administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, utilities expense, repair and maintenance expense, franchise fees and management fees. Hotel operating expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 219.9 million and 203.7 million, respectively, or 58.1 and 56.9 of total revenue for the respective periods, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, hotel operating expense totaled 633.5 million and 589.4 million, respectively, or 57.7 and 57.1 of total revenue for the respective periods. The increases in hotel operating expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, were led by the additional hotels acquired in 2023 and 2024 and amplified by increased labor costs, repairs and maintenance and sales and marketing costs driven by inflationary pressures throughout the overall economy and revenue growth for certain variable expenses. The Company continues to feel upward pressure on wage rates given a competitive labor market where the demand for hotel labor remains higher than the availability of hotel associates. However, the rate of growth has slowed and management companies have made progress in reducing their use of contract labor. For the remainder of 2024, the Company anticipates a slightly more favorable operating expense environment as the impact of inflationary pressures moderates. The Company continues to monitor its management companies efforts to realize operational efficiencies and mitigate the impact of cost pressures resulting from inflation and a tight labor market. The Company will continue to support its management companies to implement adjustments to the hotel operating model in response to continued changes in the operating environment and guest preferences, including its efforts to maximize operational efficiency.

Property Taxes, Insurance and Other Expense 
 Property taxes, insurance and other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 20.9 million and 21.7 million, respectively, or 5.5 and 6.1 of total revenue for the respective periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, property taxes, insurance and other expense totaled 63.9 million and 61.3 million, respectively, or 5.8 and 5.9 of total revenue for the respective periods. The decrease in property taxes, insurance and other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a state franchise tax refund received during the third quarter of 2024 resulting from legislative changes. The increase in property taxes, insurance and other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in casualty insurance premiums and increases in property taxes in certain locations, partially offset by decreases at other locations due to successful appeals of tax assessments, decreases in property insurance premiums and the state franchise tax refund. The Company will continue to proactively pursue tax assessment appeals in certain jurisdictions in an attempt to minimize tax increases, as warranted. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 9.2 million and 11.1 million, respectively, or 2.4 and 3.1 of total revenue for the respective periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expense was 30.8 million and 34.6 million, respectively, or 2.8 and 3.4 of total revenue for the respective periods. The principal components of general and administrative expense are payroll and related benefit costs, executive incentive compensation, legal fees, accounting fees and reporting expenses. The decreases in general and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to decreased accruals for anticipated performance under the Company s executive incentive compensation plan, partially offset by increased payroll and related benefit costs. 
 Loss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets 
 Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was approximately 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to two properties identified by the Company in the third quarter of 2024 for potential sale. See Note 3 titled Assets Held for Sale and Dispositions in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional information concerning this impairment loss. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 48.1 million and 45.5 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization expense was 142.7 million and 137.4 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents expense of the Company s hotel buildings and related improvements, and associated personal property (furniture, fixtures, and equipment) for the respective periods owned. The increases of approximately 2.6 million and 5.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to the acquisitions of six hotels and one free-standing parking garage in 2023 and two hotels in the first half of 2024, as well as renovations completed throughout 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the sale of three hotels in 2024. 
 Interest and Other Expense, net 
 Interest and other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.2 million and 17.5 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest and other expense, net was 57.9 million and 51.0 million, respectively. Interest and other expense, net for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is net of approximately 0.7 million of interest capitalized associated with renovation projects. 
 Interest expense related to the Company s debt instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the same periods of 2023 as a result of higher average borrowings associated with variable-rate debt and higher average interest rates on the Company's variable-rate debt due to the current inflationary environment. The Company anticipates interest expense for the remainder of 2024 will be greater than the interest expense for the same period of 2023 as a result of a decrease in the amount of variable-rate debt that is fixed by interest rate swaps and higher borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. These borrowings financed acquisitions, share repurchases and repayment of matured secured debt obligations, all of which occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The proportion of fixed-rate debt decreased over the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, as the Company had six interest rate swaps in effect on 285.0 million of variable-rate debt that matured during 2024 while the Company entered into four new swaps in effect on 200.0 million of variable rate debt during 2024, but at a higher fixed rate than the swaps that expired. If the Company continues to replace expiring interest rate swaps in the current interest rate environment with new agreements, the Company anticipates those new agreements to be at higher rates than the expiring swap agreements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: Funds from Operations FFO ), Modified Funds from Operations MFFO ), Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA ), Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate EBITDAre ), Adjusted EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss), cash flow from operations or any other operating GAAP measure. FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Company s cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms, the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors when comparing the Company s results between periods and with other REITs. 
 FFO and MFFO 
 The Company calculates and presents FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ), which defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets (including gains and losses from change in control), extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and impairments, and adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations. The Company further believes that by excluding the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report FFO using the Nareit definition. FFO as presented by the Company is applicable only to its common shareholders, but does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders. 
 The Company calculates MFFO by further adjusting FFO for the exclusion of amortization of finance ground lease assets, amortization of favorable and unfavorable operating leases, net and non-cash straight-line operating ground lease expense, as these expenses do not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels. The Company presents MFFO when evaluating its performance because it believes that it provides further useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance. 
 The following table reconciles the Company s GAAP net income to FFO and MFFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA 
 EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries and is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it helps the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). In addition, certain covenants included in the agreements governing the Company s indebtedness use EBITDA, as defined in the specific credit agreement, as a measure of financial compliance. 
 25 

In addition to EBITDA, the Company also calculates and presents EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by Nareit, which defines EBITDAre as EBITDA, excluding gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets (including gains and losses from change in control), plus real estate related impairments, and adjustments to reflect the entity s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company presents EBITDAre because it believes that it provides further useful information to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report EBITDAre using the Nareit definition. 
 The Company also considers the exclusion of non-cash straight-line operating ground lease expense from EBITDAre useful, as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels (Adjusted EBITDAre). 
 The Company further excludes actual corporate-level general and administrative expense for the Company as well as Adjusted EBITDAre from the non-hotel property from Adjusted EBITDAre (Adjusted Hotel EBITDA) to isolate property-level operational performance over which the Company s hotel operators have direct control. The Company believes Adjusted Hotel EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding operating performance and it is used by management to measure the performance of the Company s hotels and effectiveness of the operators of the hotels.

(1) Hotel is encumbered by mortgage. 

(2) Property is subject to ground lease. 

(3) In May 2023, the Company entered into an operating lease for an initial 15-year term with a third-party hotel operator at its independent boutique hotel in New York, New York for all hotel operations of the hotel s 210 guest rooms. Lease revenue from this property is recorded in other revenue in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. As a result of the lease and transfer of possession to the operator, this property has been excluded from the Company s hotel and guest room counts since May 2023 and is considered a non-hotel property. As a result of the operator's failure to make lease payments, the Company has commenced legal proceedings to remove the operator from possession of the hotel. The Company intends to enforce its rights under the lease and transition management of the hotel to a third-party manager, however, the removal process is still ongoing and the timing of the resolution of this matter and the transition of management operations cannot be predicted at this time. 

(4) Hotel is classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and is expected to be sold to an unrelated third party in November 2024. 

(5) In the second quarter of 2024, the property converted a meeting room into a guest room, increasing the number of guest rooms from 299 at acquisition to 300. 

(6) Manager noted as of September 30, 2024. Effective October 1, 2024, management responsibility of this property was transferred from Crescent Hotels Resorts, LLC Crescent to Highgate Hotels, L.P. 

Related Parties 
 The Company has engaged in, and is expected to continue to engage in, transactions with related parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm s length, and the results of the Company s operations may have been different if these transactions were conducted with non-related parties. See Note 6 titled Related Parties in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional information concerning the Company s related party transactions. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capital Resources 
 The Company s principal short-term sources of liquidity are the operating cash flows generated from the Company s properties and availability under its Revolving Credit Facility. Over the long term, the Company may receive proceeds from strategic additional 
 33 

secured and unsecured debt financing, dispositions of its hotel properties and offerings of the Company s common shares, including pursuant to the Company s current at-the-market offering program. Macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, increases in interest rates and general market uncertainty, could impact the Company s ability to raise debt or equity capital to fund long-term liquidity requirements in a cost-effective manner. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.5 billion of total outstanding debt consisting of 256.5 million of mortgage debt and 1.3 billion outstanding under its unsecured credit facilities, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had available corporate cash on hand of approximately 6.1 million, and unused borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility of approximately 539.5 million. 
 The credit agreements governing the unsecured credit facilities contain mandatory prepayment requirements, customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The credit agreements require that the Company comply with various covenants, which include, among others, a minimum tangible net worth, maximum debt limits, minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios, and restrictions on certain investments. The Company was in compliance with the applicable covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 See Note 4 titled Debt in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a description of the Company s debt agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company has a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-262915) that was automatically effective upon filing on February 23, 2022. The Company may offer an indeterminate number or amount, as the case may be, of (1) common shares, no par value per share; (2) preferred shares, no par value per share; (3) depository shares representing the Company s preferred shares; (4) warrants exercisable for the Company s common shares, preferred shares or depository shares representing preferred shares; (5) rights to purchase common shares; and (6) unsecured senior or subordinate debt securities, all of which may be issued from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. 
 In connection with the Company s current shelf registration statement, on February 23, 2024, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of 500 million of its common shares under the ATM Program. No common shares were sold under the Company s ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and no common shares were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 under the Prior ATM Program, which was terminated in February 2024 in connection with the commencement of the current ATM Program. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold approximately 12.8 million common shares under the Prior ATM Program at a weighted-average market sales price of approximately 17.05 per common share and received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 218.6 million and proceeds net of offering costs, which included 2.6 million of commissions, of approximately 216.0 million. The Company plans to use future net proceeds from the sale of shares under the ATM Program for general corporate purposes which may include, among other things, acquisitions of additional properties, the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, improvement of properties in its portfolio and working capital. The Company may also use the future net proceeds to acquire another REIT or other company that invests in income producing properties. Future offerings will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company, including market conditions, the trading price of the Company s common shares and opportunities for uses of any proceeds. 
 Capital Uses 
 The Company anticipates that cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Facility, additional borrowings, and proceeds from hotel dispositions and equity offerings will be adequate to meet its anticipated liquidity requirements, including share repurchases, capital improvements, debt service, hotel acquisitions, lease commitments, cash management activities and required distributions to shareholders. 
 Distributions 
 The Company generally must distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order to maintain its REIT status. On September 19, 2024, the Company declared a monthly cash distribution of 0.08 per common share, paid on October 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid distributions of 0.24 and 0.77 per common share, respectively, for a total of 57.7 million and 185.9 million, respectively. Subsequent to quarter end, on October 18, 2024, the Company declared a monthly cash distribution of 0.08 per common share, payable on November 15, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2024. 
 The Company's current annual distribution rate, payable monthly, is 0.96 per common share. As it has done historically, due to seasonality, the Company may use its Revolving Credit Facility to maintain the consistency of the monthly distribution rate, taking into consideration any acquisitions, dispositions, capital improvements and economic cycles. While management currently expects 
 34 

monthly cash distributions to continue at 0.08 per common share, any distribution will be subject to approval of the Company s Board of Directors, and there can be no assurance of the classification, timing or duration of distributions at any particular distribution rate. The Board of Directors monitors the Company s distribution rate relative to the performance of its hotels on an ongoing basis and may make adjustments to the distribution rate as determined to be prudent in relation to other cash requirements of the Company or to the extent required to maintain the Company s REIT status. If cash flows from operations and the Revolving Credit Facility are not adequate to meet liquidity requirements, the Company may utilize additional financing sources to make distributions. Although the Company has relatively low levels of debt, there can be no assurance it will be successful with this strategy, and it may need to reduce its distributions to minimum levels required to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust. If the Company were unable to extend its maturing debt in future periods or if it were to default on its debt, it may be unable to make distributions. 
 Share Repurchases 
 In May 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved a one-year extension of its existing Share Repurchase Program, authorizing share repurchases up to an aggregate of 335.4 million. The Share Repurchase Program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company and will end in July 2025 if not terminated or extended earlier. The Company previously entered into and expects to continue to enter into written trading plans as part of the Share Repurchase Program that provide for share repurchases in open market transactions that are intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased, under its Share Repurchase Program, approximately 1.4 million of its common shares at a weighted-average market purchase price of approximately 14.02 per common share for an aggregate purchase price, including commissions, of approximately 19.2 million, bringing the total for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to approximately 2.4 million common shares at a weighted-average market purchase price of approximately 14.16 per common share for an aggregate purchase price, including commissions, of approximately 34.7 million. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program have been funded, and the Company intends to fund future repurchases, with cash on hand, proceeds from dispositions or availability under its unsecured credit facilities, subject to applicable restrictions under the Company s unsecured credit facilities (if any). The timing of share repurchases and the number of common shares to be repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program will also depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 300.8 million remained available for purchase under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 Capital Improvements 
 Management routinely monitors the condition and operations of its hotels and plans renovations and other improvements as it deems prudent. The Company is committed to maintaining and enhancing each property s competitive position in its market. The Company has invested in and plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels. Under certain loan and management agreements, the Company is required to place in escrow funds for the repair, replacement and refurbishing of furniture, fixtures, and equipment at the applicable hotel, based on a percentage of the hotel s gross revenues, provided that such amount may be used for the Company s capital expenditures with respect to those hotels. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held approximately 29.6 million in reserves related to these properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company invested approximately 47.7 million in capital expenditures. The Company anticipates spending approximately 75 million to 85 million during 2024, which includes various comprehensive renovation projects for approximately 20 properties, however, inflationary pressures or supply chain shortages, among other issues, may result in increased costs and delays for anticipated projects. The Company does not currently have any existing or planned projects for new property development. 
 Upcoming Debt Maturities and Debt Service Payments 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 340.1 million of principal and interest payments due on its debt over the next 12 months. Included in this total are two mortgages totaling 34.0 million that mature in the second quarter of 2025 and two term loans totaling 225.0 million that mature in the third quarter of 2025. The Company plans to pay outstanding amounts and service payments due upon the upcoming debt maturity dates using funds from operations, borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility, proceeds from new financing, available credit extensions under its unsecured credit facilities or refinancing the maturing debt. The Company may also pursue amendments with its lenders to extend the maturity date of any expiring loans. Interest expense related to the Company s unsecured credit facilities is expected to be higher over the next 12 months than it was during the previous 12 months as a result of increased borrowings under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility and a decrease in the amount of the Company s variable-rate debt that is fixed by interest rate swaps partially offset by the expected decrease in SOFR rates. The proportion of variable-rate debt that is fixed by interest rate swaps has decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the Company had six interest rate swaps in effect on 285.0 million of variable-rate debt that matured while the Company entered into four new interest rate swaps in effect on 200.0 million but at higher rates than the expiring swap agreements. If the Company replaces expiring interest rate swaps in the current interest rate environment with new agreements, the Company anticipates those new agreements to be at higher rates than the expiring swap agreements. See Note 4 titled Debt and Note 5 titled Fair Value of Financial Instruments in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this 
 35 

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more detail regarding future maturities of the Company s debt instruments and interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Purchase Contract Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had one outstanding contract, which was entered into during May 2023, for the potential purchase of a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee for an expected purchase price of approximately 98.2 million. The hotel is under development and is currently planned to be completed and opened for business in late 2025, as a 260-guest-room Motto. As of September 30, 2024, a 1.1 million contract deposit (refundable if the seller does not meet its obligations under the contract) had been paid. If the closing occurs, the Company plans to utilize its available cash or borrowings, including borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities available at closing, to purchase the hotel under contract. Although the Company is working towards acquiring this hotel, there are a number of conditions to closing that have not yet been satisfied, and there can be no assurance that closing on this hotel will occur under the outstanding purchase contract. If the seller meets all of the conditions to closing, the Company is obligated to specifically perform under the purchase contract and acquire this hotel. As this hotel is under development, at this time, the seller has not met all of the conditions to closing. 
 Cash Management Activities 
 As part of the cost sharing arrangements discussed in Note 6, titled Related Parties in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, certain day-to-day transactions may result in amounts due to or from the Company and ARG. To efficiently manage cash disbursements, the Company or ARG may make payments for the other company. Under the cash management process, each company may advance or defer up to 1 million at any time. Each quarter, any outstanding amounts are settled between the companies. This process allows each company to minimize its cash on hand and reduces the cost for each company. The amounts outstanding at any point in time are not significant to either of the companies. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 The Company relies on the performance of its hotels and the ability of its hotel operators to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation. Hotel operators, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation on the Company's operating expenses. However, competitive pressures and other factors could limit the operators ability to raise room rates and, as a result, the Company may not be able to offset increased operating expenses with increases in revenue. 
 Business Interruption 
 Being in the real estate industry, the Company is exposed to natural disasters on both a local and national scale. Although management believes the Company has adequate insurance to cover this exposure, there can be no assurance that such events will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 Seasonality 
 The hotel industry historically has been seasonal in nature. Seasonal variations in occupancy at the Company s hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in its revenues. Generally, occupancy rates and hotel revenues for the Company s hotels are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, the Company expects to utilize cash on hand or available financing sources to meet cash requirements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of the Company s financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the Company s financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The Company has discussed those policies and estimates that it believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2024. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies or the methods or assumptions applied. 
 36 

Subsequent Events 
 On October 15, 2024, the Company paid approximately 19.2 million, or 0.08 per common share, in distributions to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2024. 
 On October 18, 2024, the Company declared a monthly cash distribution of 0.08 per common share. The distribution is payable on November 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2024. 
 In October 2024, the Company entered into three purchase and sale agreements with unrelated parties for the sale of three hotels for a combined gross sales price of 28.0 million. The Company expects to complete the sales of these hotels in late 2024 or early 2025. There are many conditions to closing on the sales of these hotels that have not yet been satisfied, and there can be no assurance that closings on the sales of these hotels will occur under the outstanding purchase and sale agreements. 
 
 37 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s financial instruments were not exposed to significant market risk due to foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk or equity price risk. However, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk due to possible changes in short-term interest rates as it invests its cash or borrows on its Revolving Credit Facility and due to the portion of its variable-rate term debt that is not fixed by interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024, after giving effect to interest rate swaps, as described below, approximately 390.5 million, or approximately 26 of the Company s total debt outstanding, was subject to variable interest rates. Based on the Company s variable-rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, every 100 basis points change in interest rates will impact the Company s annual net income by approximately 3.9 million, all other factors remaining the same. With the exception of interest rate swap transactions, the Company has not engaged in transactions in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s variable-rate debt consisted of its unsecured credit facilities, including borrowings outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility and 1.0 billion of term loans. Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk on a portion of its variable-rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 12 interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest payments on approximately 735.0 million of the Company s variable-rate debt outstanding with swap maturity dates ranging from May 2025 to December 2029. Under the terms of all of the Company s interest rate swaps, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate of interest equal to the annual rate of the one-month SOFR plus a 0.10 SOFR spread adjustment. See Note 5 titled Fair Value of Financial Instruments in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a description of the Company s interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition to its variable-rate debt and interest rate swaps discussed above, the Company has assumed or originated fixed interest rate mortgages payable to lenders under permanent financing arrangements as well as two fixed-rate senior notes facilities totaling 125 million. The following table summarizes the annual maturities and average interest rates of the Company s mortgage debt and borrowings outstanding under its unsecured credit facilities at September 30, 2024. All dollar amounts are in thousands.

Item 5. Other Information. 
 Trading Arrangements 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K. 
 Performance Award Agreement 
 In November 2024, the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company approved a form of Grant and Performance Award Agreement for future use in connection with the grant of annual incentive awards to executive officers of the Company Form Award Agreement ). Similar to the annual incentive awards the Company has historically made to its executive officers, the Form Award Agreement provides that awards will be based on two components (achievement of certain operating goals and metrics and certain long-term metrics), and if achieved, the earned award will be settled in cash, common stock of the Company (a portion of which may be fully vested when issued) or a combination of both. 
 The foregoing summary is qualified, in its entirety, by reference to the full text of the Form Award Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.

Page 5 of 11

c. Withholding Taxes .
