Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Quarterly Report, contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management and expected market growth are forward looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, target, would and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words. In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. The forward looking statements and opinions contained in this Quarterly Report are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report and, while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. 
 These forward looking statements include, among other things, statements about: 
 our expectations for the timing, quantity and quality of information to be reported from our SELECT-MDS-1 clinical trial; 

our plans with respect to SELECT-MDS-1 or any future clinical trials, whether conducted by us or by any collaborators, including the timing of these trials and of the anticipated results; 

our ability to replicate in any clinical trial of a product candidate the results we observed in preclinical or earlier clinical studies of such product candidate; 

our ability to replicate in the final results of any clinical trial of one of our product candidates the results we observed in interim results of such clinical trial; 

our plans to research, develop, seek approval for, manufacture and commercialize tamibarotene or any future product candidates; 

our plans to develop and seek approval of diagnostic tests for use in identifying patients who may benefit from treatment with tamibarotene or any future product candidates; 

our ability to enter into, and the terms and timing of, any collaborations, license agreements, asset sales, or other arrangements; 

the potential benefits of any collaboration; 

developments relating to our competitors and our industry; 

the impact of government laws and regulations; 

the timing of and our ability to file new drug applications and obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for tamibarotene or any future product candidates; 

the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of any products for which we receive marketing approval; 

our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy; 

our intellectual property position and strategy; 

our ability to identify additional products or product candidates with significant commercial potential; 

our expectations related to the use of our current cash and cash equivalents and the period of time in which such capital will be sufficient to fund our planned operations; 

our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and need for additional financing; 

our ability to secure sufficient additional capital in the near term or implement other strategies needed to alleviate our current doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; and 

general economic conditions, including inflation and recession risk.

We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward looking statements we make. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. 
 Our forward looking statements also do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, collaborations, joint ventures or investments that we may make or enter into. 
 This report also includes statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys, and studies conducted by third parties as well as our own estimates. All of the market data used in this report involve a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such data. Industry publications and third-party research, surveys, and studies generally indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities for tamibarotene or any future product candidate include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research, and other surveys, which may be based on a small sample size and may fail to accurately reflect market opportunities. While we believe that the statistical and other industry and market data included in this Quarterly Report is based on reasonable assumptions, such data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed in the "Risk Factors" section included in this Quarterly Report. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates and observations made by the independent parties or by us. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLI DATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (unaudited) 
 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more registered offerings. The 2023 Registration Statement was declared effective on April 28, 2023. Further, in April 2023, the Company entered into an at-the-market sales agreement (the 2023 Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC Cowen pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million through Cowen pursuant to the 2023 Registration Statement. On October 2, 2023, the Company announced a strategic realignment to prioritize key development and pre-launch activities to advance tamibarotene for the treatment of newly diagnosed higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia, and to stop further investment in the clinical development of SY-2101 (oral arsenic trioxide) for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia, as well as in the Company s preclinical and discovery-stage programs. In connection with these decisions, the Company instituted certain expense reduction measures (the Restructuring ), including a reduction of approximately of the Company s employee base excluding members of the Company s drug discovery organization whose employment ended concurrently with the termination, effective October 16, 2023, of its collaboration with Pfizer, Inc. Pfizer related to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. The Restructuring was completed by February 2024. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other late-stage clinical companies, including dependence on key individuals; risks inherent in the development and commercialization of medicines to treat human disease; competition from other companies, many of which are larger and better capitalized; risks relating to obtaining and maintaining necessary intellectual property protection; and the need to obtain adequate additional financing to fund the development of its product candidates. If the Company is unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, it would be forced to delay, reduce, eliminate or out-license certain of its research and development programs or future commercialization rights to its product candidates. The Company has incurred significant net operating losses in every year since its inception. It expects to continue to incur significant and increasing net operating losses for at least the next several years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company has not generated any revenues from product sales, has not completed the development of any product candidate and may never have a product candidate approved for commercialization. The Company has financed its operations to date primarily through a credit facility, the issuance of equity securities and through license and collaboration agreements. The Company has devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative activities to support such research and development. The Company s net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company s stockholders equity and working capital. Under ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , management is required at each reporting period to evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Successful completion of the Company s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent upon future events, including obtaining adequate financing to support the Company s cost structure and operating plan. Management s plans to alleviate its financing requirements include, among other things, pursuing one or more of the following steps, none of which can be guaranteed or is entirely within the Company s control: 	raise funding through the issuance of the Company s common or preferred stock; 	raise funding through debt financing; and

operating segment. The Company operates only in the United States. 
 
 financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under its investment policy, the Company limits amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The Company is not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of the Company s investment policy, in order of priority, are safety and preservation of principal and liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements.

t record any impairment losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In connection with the Restructuring, the Company entered into an exclusive auction agreement in October 2023 to sell all of its laboratory equipment by public auction. The Company concluded that the assets met the held for sale criteria and has written the assets down to their fair value less cost to sell of million which resulted in an impairment charge of million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These assets held for sale are recorded in prepaid and other current assets in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023.

Assumptions Used in Determining Fair Value of Warrants The Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to shares of common stock in connection with a private placement in September 2022 (the 2022 Warrants and warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to shares of common stock in connection with a private placement in December 2020 (the 2020 Warrants ). The Company accounted for the 2022 Warrants and 2020 Warrants as liabilities. The Company recorded the fair value of these warrants upon issuance using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is required to revalue these warrants at each reporting date with any changes in fair value recorded on the Company's statement of operations. The valuation of the 2022 Warrants and 2020 Warrants is considered under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and influenced by the fair value of the underlying common stock of the Company.

of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding obligations, and (ii) for February 1, 2025 and at all times thereafter through and including May 31, 2026, one hundred twenty percent of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding obligations, and revenue performance covenants, and that the failure to satisfy the primary endpoint for the SELECT-MDS-1 trial, the termination of the Company s SELECT-MDS-1 trial for safety reasons, or the failure to obtain United States Food and Drug Administration FDA approval for tamibarotene for the treatment of newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients with RARA overexpression by May 31, 2026, would each constitute events of default under the Loan Agreement. In addition, upon drawing any further loans under the Loan Agreement the Company has agreed to grant the Lender, to the extent permitted under existing agreements and applicable law, a security interest in all intellectual property owned by the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Agreement. In connection with the issuance of the Term A loan, the Company issued the Lender warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price per share of in February 2020. In connection with the issuance of the Term B loan, the Company issued the Lender warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share in December 2020 (collectively, the Oxford Warrants ). The Oxford Warrants are exercisable within from the respective dates of issuance. The Oxford Warrants are classified as a component of permanent equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the Oxford Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return.

 shares to shares, and (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of the Company s common stock from shares to shares. T he Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the same day to effect the increase in the Company's authorized shares. Issuance of Securities through an Underwritten Registered Direct Offering In December 2023, the Company issued million shares of common stock and, in lieu of its common stock to certain investors who so chose, pre-funded warrants (the "2023 Pre-Funded Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock , pursuant to the 2023 Registration Statement, in an underwritten registered direct offering for gross proceeds of million, before deducting underwriting fees and other transaction costs of million. The Company determined that the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants are freestanding financial instruments because they are both legally detachable and separately exercisable from the common stock sold in the offering. As such, the Company evaluated the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants to determine whether they represent instruments that require liability classification pursuant to the guidance in ASC 480. However, the Company concluded that the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants are not a liability within the scope of ASC 480 due to their characteristics. Further, the Company determined that the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants do not meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 because they do not meet the criteria regarding no or little initial net investment. Accordingly, the Company assessed the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants relative to the guidance in ASC No. 815-40, Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, to determine the appropriate treatment. The Company concluded that the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants are both indexed to its own stock and meet all other conditions for equity classification. Accordingly, the Company has classified the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants as permanent equity. Issuance of Securities through a Private Placement On September 16, 2022, the Company issued in a private placement (the 2022 Private Placement shares of common stock, and, in lieu of shares of common stock, the pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock (the 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants ), and, in each case, the accompanying 2022 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to additional shares of common stock (or 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) at a price of per share and accompanying 2022 Warrant (or per 2022 Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying 2022 Warrant). The 2022 Private Placement resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of million, before million of transaction costs. On December 8, 2020, through a private placement (the 2020 Private Placement ), the Company issued shares of common stock, and, in lieu of shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock (the 2020 Pre-Funded Warrants ), and, in each case, accompanying 2020 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to additional shares of common stock (or 2020 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) at a price of per share and accompanying 2020 Warrant (or per 

 21 

million, before million of transaction costs. In the event of certain fundamental transactions involving the Company, the holders of the 2022 Warrants and 2020 Warrants may require the Company to make a payment based on a Black-Scholes valuation, using specified inputs. The holders of 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants and 2020 Pre-Funded Warrants do not have similar rights. Therefore, the Company accounted for the 2022 Warrants and 2020 Warrants as liabilities, while the 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants and 2020 Pre-Funded Warrants met the permanent equity criteria classification. The 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants and 2020 Pre-Funded Warrants are classified as a component of permanent equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants and 2020 Pre-Funded Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The initial fair value of the 2022 Warrants and the 2020 Warrants at issuance was million and million, respectively, determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain for the remeasurement of the aggregate fair value of the 2022 Warrants and the 2020 Warrants in its condensed statement of operations of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss for the remeasurement of the aggregate fair value of the 2022 Warrants and the 2020 Warrants in its condensed statement of operations of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of the 2022 Warrants and the 2020 Warrants included in the Company's condensed balance sheet was million and million, respectively. 

 shares of the Company s common stock, (ii) of the total number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding on the first day of the applicable year, and (iii) an amount determined by the Company s board of directors. For the calendar year beginning January 1, 2024, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 ESPP was increased by shares. As of September 30, 2024, shares remained available for future issuance under the 2016 ESPP. 2022 Inducement Stock Incentive Plan On January 25, 2022, the Company s board of directors adopted the 2022 Inducement Stock Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan ), pursuant to which the Company may grant non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. Awards under the 2022 Plan may only be granted to persons who (i) were not previously an employee or director of the Company or (ii) are commencing employment with the Company following a bona fide period of non-employment, in either case as an inducement material to the individual s entering into employment with the Company and in accordance with the requirements of Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635(c)(4). In January 2023, the Company's board of directors amended the 202 2 Plan to increase the aggregate number of shares that can be granted by shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024 , shares rem ained available for future issuance under the 2022 Plan. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan The 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2022 EIP was adopted by the board of directors on July 14, 2022, approved by the stockholders and became effective on September 15, 2022. The 2022 EIP replaced the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan ). Any options or awards outstanding under the 2016 Plan remained outstanding and effective. Under the 2022 EIP, the Company may grant incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. Under the 2022 EIP, stock options may not be granted at less than fair value on the date of grant. On June 5, 2024, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the 2022 EIP to increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock available for 

 22 

shares. As of September 30, 2024 , shares re mained available for future issuance under the 2022 EIP. Stock Options Terms of stock option agreements, including vesting requirements, are determined by the board of directors, subject to the provisions of the applicable plan. Stock option awards granted by the Company generally vest over , with vesting on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and vesting ratably, on a monthly basis, over the remaining . Such awards have a contractual term of from the grant date.

 Overview 
 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing new standards of care for the frontline treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies. Driven by the motivation to help patients with blood disorders that have largely eluded other targeted approaches, we are advancing tamibarotene, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RAR a , agonist for which we are conducting SELECT-MDS-1, a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or HR-MDS. 
 
 At the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition held in December 2020, or ASH 2020, we presented data from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who are not suitable candidates for standard intensive chemotherapy, as well as in relapsed or refractory AML patients who have been prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA , the gene that codes for RAR a , biomarker. As of an October 1, 2020 data cut-off, 51 newly diagnosed unfit AML patients, including patients with and without RARA gene overexpression, were eligible for a safety analysis. Among these patients, tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicity relative to either as a single agent, including rates of myelosuppression that were comparable to single agent azacitidine. As of the data cut-off, of the 18 patients with RARA overexpression that were evaluable for clinical response, 50 of patients achieved complete response, or CR, and 11 achieved a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, or CRi, for a total CR/CRi rate of 61 . The median time to initial CR/CRi response was 1.2 months, the median duration of CR/CRi response was 10.8 months, and the median overall survival, or OS, among patients who achieved a CR or CRi was 18.0 months. As of the data cut-off, of the 28 patients without RARA overexpression that were evaluable for clinical response, the overall response rate was 43 , with a CR/CRi rate of 32 , with 25 of patients achieving CR and 7 achieving CRi. The median time to initial CR/CRi response was 3.0 months, and the median duration of CR/CRi response was 10.3 months. 
 
 HR-MDS is a hematologic malignancy for which disease-related cytopenias result in significant morbidity and mortality, with more than half of HR-MDS patients progressing to AML, and we believe that approximately 50 of HR-MDS patients overexpress RARA . Based on the data presented at ASH 2020 and our assessment of ongoing areas of high unmet need, we advanced tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine into a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients with RARA overexpression, which we refer to as SELECT-MDS-1. We believe that approximately 9,000 HR-MDS patients are diagnosed in the United States each year. We expect that the total market opportunity for HR-MDS therapeutics in the United States will be approximately 1.6 billion by 2029, and that the total United States market opportunity for tamibarotene in HR-MDS patients with RARA overexpression will be over 800 million by 2029. The SELECT-MDS-1 trial is evaluating newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients with RARA overexpression in a double-blind placebo-controlled study design, randomized 2:1 to receive tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine, or placebo in combination with azacitidine, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint is based on 190 patients to provide over 90 power to detect a difference in CR rates between the experimental and 
 25 

control arms with a one-sided alpha of 0.025. The United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has expressed that the CR rate is an acceptable efficacy endpoint for either full or accelerated approval for treatment of newly diagnosed HR-MDS with supporting data on durability of remission. Informed by feedback from the FDA, we amended the SELECT-MDS-1 clinical trial protocol in March 2023 to include a total of approximately 550 patients to enable us to assess OS as a key secondary endpoint, which could allow the trial to serve as a confirmatory study if needed to convert an accelerated approval to a full approval in the future. The amended clinical trial protocol is designed with 80 power to detect a difference in OS rates for the key secondary endpoint between the experimental and control arms, also with a one-sided alpha of 0.025. In January 2023, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed HR-MDS who are positive for RARA overexpression. In the first quarter of 2024, we completed enrollment of the 190 patients necessary to support the CR primary endpoint analysis. In addition, the SELECT-MDS-1 trial passed a pre-specified interim futility analysis of the primary endpoint based on an analysis, blinded to us, in the initial 50 of the enrolled patients. The analysis was conducted by an independent data monitoring committee, who also noted that there were no concerning safety signals and recommended that the trial continue without modification. We expect to report pivotal CR data from the SELECT-MDS-1 trial in mid-November of 2024. 
 
 In August 2024, we announced our decision to discontinue enrollment in the SELECT-AML-1 Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the triplet regimen of tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to the doublet regimen of venetoclax and azacitidine in newly diagnosed, unfit patients with AML and RARA gene overexpression, based on the results of a prespecified interim analysis of the trial. 
 
 As part of our launch preparation activities for tamibarotene, we have engaged a leading provider of testing services to develop and validate a laboratory-developed test based on our existing clinical trial assay to provide RARA overexpression testing at launch, and we continue to evaluate multiple approaches to the development of a commercial companion diagnostic. We are also partnered with Qiagen Manchester Limited to develop a kit-based testing solution for future commercialization. 
 Financings 
 
 On December 21, 2023, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,939,591 shares of our common stock at a price of 4.42 per share, and, in lieu of our common stock to certain investors who so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,242,588 shares of our common stock at a price of 4.419 per pre-funded warrant, in an underwritten offering resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 45.0 million, before deducting underwriting fees and other transaction costs of approximately 3.2 million. The offering was made pursuant to an underwriting agreement between us and Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, and Piper Sandler Co. on December 18, 2023. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the underwriters purchased the shares of common stock from us at a price of 4.1548 per share and the pre-funded warrants from us at a price of 4.15386 per share underlying each pre-funded warrant. The shares of common stock and the pre-funded warrants were issued, and any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants will be issued, pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was filed with the SEC on April 6, 2023 and declared effective by the SEC on April 28, 2023. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. We did not recognize any revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized revenue of 3.8 million and 9.6 million, respectively, related to our collaboration with Global Blood Therapeutics, or GBT. The collaboration with GBT was terminated in October 2023 and we do not expect to recognize collaboration revenue from GBT following that date. 
 Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, which include: 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits; 

26 

stock-based compensation expense; 

external costs of funding activities performed by third parties that conduct research and development on our behalf and of purchasing supplies used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; 

consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; and 

facilities costs, depreciation and amortization and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs. 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments made to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided. 
 We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or certain external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs. 
 The following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program, as well as expenses not allocated to programs, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

We expect to incur significant research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance the clinical development of tamibarotene. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of tamibarotene or any future product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of: 
 
 approval of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, to commence any future clinical trials; 

successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; 

successful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; 

successful development, and subsequent clearance or approval, of diagnostic tests for use in identifying potential patients; 

receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities; 

27 

establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; 

commercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims; 

maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; 

retention of key personnel; 

the impact of public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics; and 

general economic conditions, including inflation and recession risk. 

Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, information technology and administrative functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services. 
 Restructuring Costs 
 Restructuring costs consist primarily of severance, post-employment benefit, outplacement services, impairment charges and any other expenses that we incur related to the realignment of our strategy and cost reduction measures. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities, including the related amortization of premiums and discounts. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable, and interest on finance lease arrangements. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities is the result of the remeasurement of the fair value of our warrant liabilities at each reporting period end. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors 
 28 

that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates. 
 We believe that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as discussed in our 2023 10-K.

The change in research and development expense was primarily attributable to activities associated with advancing our clinical programs, including the following: 
 a decrease of approximately 3.6 million, or 21 , for external research and development costs, primarily attributable to a decrease in costs associated with our clinical trial of SY-2101 and the elimination of costs associated with our discovery programs following the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023; 

a decrease of approximately 2.3 million, or 34 , for employee-related expenses, primarily due to a reduction of headcount associated with the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023; 

a decrease of approximately 1.1 million, or 67 , for stock-based compensation, primarily due to a reduction of headcount associated with the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023, and because the stock-based awards granted to employees in 2024 have performance-based vesting conditions for which no related expenses were recognized during the period; 

a decrease of approximately 0.4 million, or 26 , for consulting, licensing and professional fees, primarily related to a decrease in costs associated with our clinical trials and elimination of costs associated with our discovery programs following the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023; and 

a decrease of approximately 0.4 million, or 25 , for facilities and other expenses, primarily due to the closure of our laboratory facilities as part of the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense decreased by approximately 2.1 million, or 27 , from 7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in facilities expenses, consulting and a reduction of headcount associated with the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Restructuring Costs 
 Restructuring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consist primarily of severance, post-employment benefit, outplacement services, impairment charges and any other expenses that we incur related to the realignment of our strategy and cost reduction measures. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was derived generally from our investments in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The decrease in interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a lower average cash balance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was related to our credit facility with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford. Interest expense increased slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a higher effective interest rate during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 The gain from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the decrease in the price of our common stock from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024. The loss from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the increase in the price of our common stock from June 30, 2023 to September 30, 2023.

Revenue 
 We did not recognize any revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 9.6 million of revenue, all of which was attributable to our collaboration with GBT. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense decreased by approximately (19.5) million, or 23 , from 86.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 67.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The change in research and development expense was primarily attributable to activities associated with advancing our clinical programs, including the following: 
 a decrease of approximately 5.5 million, or 11 , for external research and development costs, primarily attributable to the decrease in costs associated with our clinical trials of prior programs related to SY-5609 and SY-2101 and the elimination of costs associated with our discovery programs following the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the clinical development of tamibarotene; 

a decrease of approximately 7.8 million, or 36 , for employee-related expenses, primarily due to a reduction of headcount associated with the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023; 

a decrease of approximately 2.0 million, or 47 , for stock-based compensation, primarily due to a reduction of headcount associated with the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023, 

31 

and because the stock-based awards granted to employees in 2024 have performance-based vesting conditions for which no related expenses were recognized during the period; 

a decrease of approximately 2.8 million, or 44 , for consulting, licensing and professional fees, primarily related to a decrease in costs associated with our clinical trials; and 

a decrease of approximately 1.4 million, or 27 , for facilities and other expenses, primarily due to the closure of our laboratory facilities as part of the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense decreased by approximately 5.0 million, or 22 , from 22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in facilities expenses, consulting and professional fees and a reduction of headcount associated with the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was derived generally from our investments in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decrease in interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a lower average cash balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was related to our credit facility with Oxford. Interest expense increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a higher effective interest rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 The gain from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the decrease in the price of our common stock from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The loss from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the increase in the price of our common stock from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We funded our operations from inception through September 30, 2024, primarily through the issuance of equity securities, through license and collaboration agreements, and through the credit facility with Oxford. 
 On February 12, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, term loans of up to an aggregate principal amount of 60.0 million were originally made available to us. A 20.0 million term loan was funded on February 12, 2020, and another 20.0 million term loan was funded on December 23, 2020. On July 3, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement with Oxford, or the First Loan Amendment. Pursuant to the First Loan Amendment, Oxford agreed to modify the Loan Agreement in order to, among other things, extend the interest only period from March 1, 2023 to March 1, 2024 and extend the maturity date from February 1, 2025 to February 1, 2026, and upon the achievement of certain milestones and subject to the payment of certain fees, further extend the interest only period to September 1, 2024 and maturity date to August 1, 2026. On May 9, 2024, we entered into a further amendment to the Loan Agreement with Oxford, or the Fourth Loan Amendment. Under the Fourth Loan Amendment, Oxford agreed to modify the Loan Agreement in order to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate amount of term loans available to us to from 40.0 million to 100.0 million, with term loans totaling 40.0 million in the aggregate becoming available to us upon achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and equity-raising milestones, and 20.0 million becoming available at Oxford's discretion; (ii) extend the interest only period from September 1, 2024 to November 1, 2025 with further extensions to as late as November 1, 
 32 

2026 upon achievement of certain milestones; and (iii) extend the maturity date from August 1, 2026 to February 1, 2028. In consideration for this Fourth Loan Amendment, we have agreed to, among other things, certain cash covenants and revenue performance covenants, and that the failure to satisfy the primary endpoint for the SELECT-MDS-1 trial, the termination of the SELECT-MDS-1 trial for safety reasons, or the failure to obtain FDA approval for tamibarotene for the treatment of newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients with RARA overexpression by May 31, 2026, would each constitute events of default under the Loan Agreement. In addition, upon drawing any further loans under the Loan Agreement we have agreed to grant Oxford, to the extent permitted under existing agreements and applicable law, a security interest in all intellectual property owned by us. As of September 30, 2024, term loans totaling 40.0 million in the aggregate remain available under the Loan Agreement upon the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and equity-raising milestones, and a 20.0 million term loan remains available under the Loan Agreement at the sole discretion of Oxford. 
 On April 6, 2023, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the 2023 Registration Statement, with the SEC to register for sale from time to time up to 250.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more registered offerings. The 2023 Registration Statement was declared effective on April 28, 2023. Further, in April 2023, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement, or the 2023 sales agreement, with Cowen, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million through Cowen pursuant to the 2023 Registration Statement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued and sold 350,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the 2023 sales agreement for gross proceeds of 1.4 million, before deducting underwriting fees. 
 Upon entry into the 2023 sales agreement, we terminated our prior at-the-market program pursuant to the original sales agreement dated July 12, 2020. At the time of such termination, the entire 75.0 million available under such agreement remained unsold. 
 In December 2023, we issued shares of our common stock and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase our common stock, pursuant to the 2023 Registration Statement, in an underwritten offering resulting in gross proceeds of 45.0 million, before deducting underwriting fees and other transaction costs of approximately 3.2 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 48.6 million of our common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2023 sales agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 203.6 million of securities remained available for future issuance under the 2023 Registration Statement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 58.3 million.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. 
 33 

Net cash used in operating activities was 81.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 91.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the loss from operations of 17.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of 3.2 million, an increase in the change of net operating assets and liabilities of 1.7 million, a decrease in depreciation and impairment of property and equipment of 1.3 million, a decrease in interest income of 1.1 million (excluding amortization of premiums and discounts), and an increase in interest expense of 0.2 million. 
 Net Cash Provided By Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 35.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the proceeds from the sale or maturities of marketable securities of 30.9 million and proceeds from disposal of property and equipment of 0.1 million, partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities of 30.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In comparison, the net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the maturity of marketable securities of 87.0 million, partially offset by the purchases of marketable securities of 51.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the net cash provided by financing activities of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the payments of issuance costs related to our underwritten registered direct offering and our at-the-market facility during the year ended December 31, 2023 of 0.3 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. In comparison, the cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. 
 Funding Requirements and Going Concern 
 We expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to advance the clinical development of tamibarotene, seek to develop diagnostic tests for use with tamibarotene, and seek marketing approval for tamibarotene or any future product candidates that we successfully develop. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for tamibarotene or any other product candidate, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to establishing sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such products. We will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, eliminate, or out-license our development programs or future commercialization rights to our product candidates. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, will enable us to fund our planned operating expense and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2025. Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including: 
 
 the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of the clinical development of tamibarotene and associated diagnostic tests; 

our ability to satisfy the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Loan Agreement with Oxford and to avoid the occurrence of any specified events of default thereunder; 

development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop; 

the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements; 

our ability to enter into, and the terms and timing of, any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements; 

34 

the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; 

the costs of commercialization activities for tamibarotene or any other product candidate that receives marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; 

the costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology; 

the costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations; 

the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to TMRC Co. Ltd. associated with the development, manufacture and commercialization of tamibarotene; 

revenue received from commercial sales, if any, of our current and future product candidates; 

our employment-related costs as we advance our clinical pipeline and establish a commercial infrastructure; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and 

the impact of public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics. 

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, tamibarotene or any future product candidate, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 
 If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 We have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net operating losses for at least the next several years. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 58.3 million and an accumulated deficit of 756.2 million. We have not generated any revenues from product sales, have not completed the development of any product candidate and may never have a product candidate approved for commercialization. We have financed our operations to date primarily through a credit facility, the issuance of equity securities and through license and collaboration agreements. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative activities to support such research and development. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital. 
 As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, under ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , management is 
 35 

required at each reporting period to evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. 
 
 Based on our current operating plan, we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of 58.3 million as of September 30, 2024 will allow us to meet our liquidity requirements into the third quarter of 2025. Our history of significant losses, our negative cash flows from operations, our limited liquidity resources currently on hand, and our dependence on our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations after the current resources are exhausted, about which there can be no certainty, have resulted in our assessment that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. We have plans in place to mitigate this risk, which primarily consist of raising additional capital through a combination of equity or debt financings, business development transactions, including the potential sale of SY-2101-related assets, and reducing cash expenditures. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in any capital raising or business development efforts, in which case we may not be able to continue our development programs as planned. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments, including cash equivalents, are in the form of money market funds and are invested in U.S. treasury or government obligations. However, because of the short-term nature of the duration of our portfolio and the low-risk profile of our investments, we believe an immediate 10 change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair market value of our investment portfolio or on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We contract with vendors that are located in Asia and Europe and certain invoices are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these arrangements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have significant liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. 
 Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 36 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as our Principal Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who serves as our Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 37 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 
 The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or the 2023 10-K. Any of the risk factors contained in this Quarterly Report and the 2023 10-K could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, and such risk factors may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital 
 We will need substantial additional funding to execute our operating plan and continue to operate as a going concern, and if we are unable to raise capital, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts. 
 Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting clinical trials, is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our planned operating expense and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2025. These funds may not be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future viability beyond one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. In any event, our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development of our product candidates. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. Although management plans to pursue additional funding, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, or at all. 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in the 2023 10-K under Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital - We have incurred significant losses since inception, expect to incur significant losses for at least the next several years, and may never achieve or maintain profitability . Our future funding requirements may also depend on: 
 the costs of launch activities related to tamibarotene and any future product candidates, including any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations; 

the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to TMRC Co. Ltd. associated with the development, manufacture and commercialization of tamibarotene; and 

the timing and amount of payments due to parties we have engaged related to the development and commercialization of diagnostic tests for use with tamibarotene. 

The terms of our loan and security agreement place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. 
 
 In February 2020, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, which is secured by substantially all of our currently owned or later acquired personal property other than our intellectual property (but including the right to payments and proceeds of intellectual property), which is subject to a negative pledge. We borrowed 20.0 million upon execution of the loan and security agreement and borrowed an additional 20.0 million term loan advance in December 2020. 
 38 

On May 9, 2024, we entered into an amendment, or the Loan Amendment, to the loan and security agreement with Oxford. We refer to the loan and security agreement with Oxford, as amended by the Loan Amendment, as the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Loan Amendment, in its capacity as lender and agent, Oxford agreed to modify the terms of the loan and security agreement to, among other things: (i) increase the aggregate amount of term loans available to us from 40.0 million to 100.0 million, with tranches totaling 40.0 million in the aggregate becoming available to us upon achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and equity-raising milestones, and 20.0 million becoming available at Oxford's discretion; (ii) extend the interest only period from September 1, 2024 to November 1, 2025 with further extensions to as late as November 1, 2026 upon achievement of certain milestones; and (iii) extend the maturity date from August 1, 2026 to February 1, 2028. 
 
 The Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries, as more fully described in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement also includes events of default. In consideration for the Loan Amendment, we agreed that the failure to satisfy the primary endpoint for the SELECT-MDS-1 trial, the termination of the SELECT-MDS-1 trial for safety reasons, or the failure to obtain FDA approval for tamibarotene for the treatment of newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients with RARA overexpression by May 31, 2026, would each constitute events of default under the Loan Agreement. If an event of default were to occur in connection with the pivotal complete response data from the SELECT-MDS-1 trial that we expect to report in mid-November of 2024, or if an event of default were otherwise to occur and continue, the Loan Agreement provides Oxford, as collateral agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the loans under the Loan Agreement, including foreclosure against our property securing the Loan Agreement, including our cash, potentially requiring us to renegotiate our agreement on terms less favorable to us, or to immediately cease operations. 
 
 Further, if we are liquidated, the lenders right to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. Oxford could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that they interpret as a material adverse change as defined under the Loan Agreement, thereby requiring us to repay the loan immediately or to attempt to reverse the declaration of default through negotiation or litigation. Any declaration by Oxford of an event of default could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects and would cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Product Candidates 
 We face substantial competition, which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do. 
 We expect that we, and any collaborators, will face significant competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to any product candidates that we, or any collaborators, may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Specifically, there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, the indication targeted in our SELECT-MDS-1 trial involving tamibarotene. 
 For example, we are aware of two new drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, since 2020 for the treatment of MDS or patient subsets within MDS (decitabine/cedazuridine and ivosidenib). Tamibarotene may also face competition from other agents currently in clinical development for MDS, including those in late-stage development from AbbVie Inc., Roche Holding AG, and Taiho Oncology, Inc. 
 Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or more tolerable side effects, have greater ease of access, or are less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. In addition, the evolving standard of care for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, may lead to evolution of the standard of care for patient subsets within MDS. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other marketing approval for their products before we, or any collaborators, are able to obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we, or any collaborators, are able to enter the market. 
 Many of our existing and potential future competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing 
 39 

approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the development of our product candidates. 
 Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 
 Failure of any third-party collaborator to successfully develop or commercialize a diagnostic test for use with tamibarotene to identify patients with RARA overexpression could harm our ability to commercialize tamibarotene. 
 We do not plan to internally develop a commercial diagnostic test to identify patients with RARA overexpression. As a result, we will be dependent on the efforts of third-party collaborators to successfully develop and commercialize a diagnostic test. As part of our launch preparation activities for tamibarotene, we have engaged a leading provider of testing services to develop and validate a laboratory-developed test based on our existing clinical trial assay to provide RARA overexpression testing at launch, and we continue to evaluate multiple approaches to the development of a commercial companion diagnostic. We are also partnered with Qiagen Manchester Limited to develop a kit-based testing solution for future commercialization. 
 Our third-party collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected or as required under our agreements with those parties, may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of a diagnostic test, may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of a diagnostic test in the clinical community, may not pursue commercialization of a diagnostic test even if they receive any required regulatory approvals, may elect not to continue the development of a diagnostic test based on changes in strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities, may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of a diagnostic test, and may terminate their relationships with us. 
 If a diagnostic test that is developed for use with tamibarotene fails to gain market acceptance, our ability to derive revenues from sales from tamibarotene would be harmed. If the third parties we engage fail to commercialize a diagnostic test, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative test for use with tamibarotene or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and/or delay commercial launch and cause us to fail to realize the full commercial potential of tamibarotene.
