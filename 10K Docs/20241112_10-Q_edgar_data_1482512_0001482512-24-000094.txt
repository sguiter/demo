 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to we, us, our, or our Company refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. In statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to our operating partnership or the operating partnership refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of September 30, 2024, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. owned approxi m ately 95.2 of the ownership interest in our operating partnership (including unvested restricted units). The remaining approximately 4.8 i nterest was owned by certain of our executive officers and directors, certain of their affiliates and other outside investors and includes unvested operating partnership performance units. As the sole general partner of our operating partnership, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our operating partnership s day-to-day management and control. 
 We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and the operating partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 enhancing investors understanding of our Company and our operating partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosures apply to both our Company and our operating partnership; and 
 creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 
 There are a few differences between our Company and our operating partnership, which are reflected in the disclosures in this report. We believe it is important to understand the differences between our Company and our operating partnership in the context of how we operate as an interrelated, consolidated company. Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. is a REIT, the only material assets of which are the units of partnership interest in our operating partnership. As a result, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, issuing equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of our operating partnership. Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. itself does not issue any indebtedness but guarantees some of the debt of our operating partnership. Our operating partnership, which is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity, holds substantially all of the assets of our Company and conducts substantially all of our business. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., which are generally contributed to our operating partnership in exchange for units of partnership interest in our operating partnership, our operating partnership generates the capital required by our Company s business through its operations, its incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of units of partnership interest in our operating partnership. 
 Non-controlling interest, stockholders equity and partners capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of our Company and those of our operating partnership. The common units in our operating partnership are accounted for as partners capital in our operating partnership s consolidated financial statements and, to the extent not held by our Company, as a non-controlling interest in our Company s consolidated financial statements. The differences between stockholders equity, partners capital and non-controlling interest result from the differences in the equity issued by our Company and our operating partnership. 
 To help investors understand the significant differences between our Company and our operating partnership, this report presents the consolidated financial statements separately for our Company and our operating partnership. All other sections of this report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are presented together for our Company and our operating partnership. 
 In order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made the requisite certifications and that our Company and our operating partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act and 18 U.S.C. 1350, this report also includes separate Part I, Item 4 Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and our operating partnership.

of its joint ventures that are VIEs. Due to its significant influence over the unconsolidated entities, the Company accounts for them using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the Company initially records the investment at cost and subsequently adjusts for equity in earnings or losses and cash contributions and distributions. 
 
 The Company s net equity investment in its unconsolidated joint ventures is reflected within investment in unconsolidated real estate entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company s share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within loss from unconsolidated real estate entities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company uses the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions up to the amount of cumulative equity in earnings recognized are classified as cash inflows from operating activities, and those in excess of that amount are classified as cash inflows from investing activities. Refer to Note 5 for further details regarding our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 

Lease Accounting 
 
 The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases ASC 842 ), which requires companies to identify lease and non-lease components of a lease agreement. Lease components relate to the right to use the leased asset whereas non-lease components relate to payments for goods or services that are transferred separately from the right to use the underlying asset.

operating segments: the management entity, Office and Studio, each of which is a reporting unit. The assessment of goodwill for impairment may initially be performed based on qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If so, a quantitative assessment is performed, and to the extent the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit. Alternatively, the Company may bypass a qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative assessment. 
 
 A qualitative assessment considers various factors such as macroeconomic, industry and market conditions to the extent they affect the earnings performance of the reporting unit, changes in business strategy and/or management of the reporting unit, changes in composition or mix of revenues and/or cost structure of the reporting unit, financial performance and business prospects of the reporting unit, among other factors. 
 
 In a quantitative assessment, significant judgment, assumptions and estimates are applied in determining the fair value of reporting units. The Company generally uses the income approach to estimate fair value by discounting the projected net cash flows of the reporting unit, and may corroborate with market-based data where available and appropriate.

For a discussion of important risks related to our business and related to investing in our securities, including risks that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from results and events referred to in the forward-looking statements, refer to Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur. 

Forward-looking Statements 
 
 Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us or our representatives in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other filings or reports filed with the SEC, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act). In particular, statements relating to our liquidity and capital resources, portfolio performance and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Furthermore, all of the statements regarding future financial performance (including anticipated funds from operations, or FFO , market conditions and demographics) are forward-looking statements. We are including this cautionary statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any such forward-looking statements. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or that management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management s beliefs and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, might, plan, estimate, project, should, will, result and similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which were based on results and trends at the time they were made, to anticipate future results or trends. 
 
 Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, liquidity or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
 
 adverse economic or real estate developments in our target markets; 
 general economic conditions; 
 defaults on, early terminations of or non-renewal of leases by tenants; 
 fluctuations in interest rates and increased operating costs; 
 our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, maintain an investment grade rating or maintain compliance with covenants under our financing arrangements; 
 our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness and maintain dividend payments; 
 lack or insufficient amounts of insurance; 
 decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates; 
 difficulties in identifying properties to acquire or dispose and completing acquisitions or dispositions; 
 our failure to successfully operate acquired properties and operations; 
 our failure to maintain our status as a REIT; 
 the loss of key personnel; 
 environmental uncertainties and risks related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; 
 financial market and foreign currency fluctuations; 
 risks related to acquisitions generally, including the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations and the impact on customers, tenants, lenders, operating results and business; 
 the inability to successfully integrate acquired properties, realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or capitalize on value creation opportunities; 
 changes in the tax laws and uncertainty as to how those changes may be applied; 
 changes in real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates; and 
 other factors affecting the real estate industry generally. 
 
 The risks set forth above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor

 can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and Current Reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Current Reports on Form 8-K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.

 2. Percent occupied for office properties is calculated as (i) square footage under commenced leases as of September 30, 2024, divided by (ii) total square feet, expressed as a percentage. Percent leased for office properties includes uncommenced leases. Percent leased for studio properties is calculated as (i) average square footage under commenced leases for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, divided by (ii) total square feet, expressed as a percentage. 
 3. Annualized base rent per square foot for office properties is calculated by multiplying (i) cash base rents under commenced leases excluding tenant reimbursements as of September 30, 2024 by (ii) 12. On a per square foot basis, ABR is divided by square footage under commenced leases as of September 30, 2024 . For all expiration years, ABR is calculated as (i) cash base rents at expiration under commenced leases divided by (ii) square footage under commenced leases as of September 30, 2024 . The methodology is the same when calculating ABR per square foot either in place or at expiration for uncommenced leases. Rent data is presented without regard to cancellation options. Where applicable, rental rates converted to USD using the foreign currency exchange rate as of September 30, 2024 . Annualized base rent per square foot for studio properties reflects actual base rent for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024 , excluding tenant reimbursements. ABR per leased square foot calculated as (i) annual base rent divided by (ii) square footage under lease as of September 30, 2024 .

 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), which are accompanied by what the Company considers the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents HPP s share of certain of these measures, which are non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated as the measure on a consolidated basis, in accordance with GAAP, plus our Operating Partnership s share of the measure from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the Operating Partnership s percentage ownership interest), minus our partners share of the measure from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners percentage ownership interests). We believe that presenting HPP s share of these measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company s financial condition and/or results of operations because we have several significant joint ventures, and in some cases, we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture. In such instances, GAAP requires us to account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting, which we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes. In other cases, GAAP requires us to consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest. As a result, management believes that presenting HPP s share of various financial measures in this manner can help investors better understand the Company s financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account its true economic interest in these joint ventures.

 Financings 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were 103.0 million of borrowings on the unsecured revolving credit facility, net of repayments. The Company generally uses the unsecured revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of properties and businesses, to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes. 
 
 On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its unsecured revolving credit facility in order to, among other things, replace CDOR as a reference rate for Canadian dollar-denominated loans under the Canadian facility with a term CORRA-based rate.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 Net loss increased 71.3 million, or 199.3 , to 107.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 35.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The reasons for the change are discussed below with respect to the decrease in net operating income for the same period. 
 
 Net Operating Income 
 
 We evaluate performance based upon property net operating income NOI ). NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities or cash flows as measured by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or our ability to make distributions. All companies may not calculate NOI in the same manner. We consider NOI to be a useful performance measure to investors and management because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We calculate NOI as net income excluding corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairments, gains/losses on sales of real estate, interest expense, interest income, transaction-related expenses and other non-operating items. We define NOI as operating revenues (including rental revenues, other property-related revenue, tenant recoveries and other operating revenues), less property-level operating expenses (which includes external management fees, if any, and property-level general and administrative expenses). NOI on a cash basis is NOI adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses. 
 
 Management further analyzes NOI by evaluating the performance from the following groups: 
 
 Same-store, which includes all of the properties owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of July 1, 2023 and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of September 30, 2024; and 
 
 Non-same-store, which includes: 
 Stabilized non-same-store properties 
 Lease-up properties 
 Repositioning properties 
 Development properties 
 Redevelopment properties 
 Held for sale properties 
 Operating results from studio service-related businesses

 NOI decreased 33.7 million, or 28.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from: 
 
 a 24.4 million decrease in same-store NOI driven by a decrease in office NOI of 24.0 million primarily due to: 
 a 22.8 million decrease in rental revenues driven by lease expirations at several properties in the San Francisco Bay Area during the last twelve months and a straight-line rent reserve related to transitioning a tenant to cash basis reporting; and 
 a 1.3 million increase in operating expenses predominantly due to higher tax and utility expenses at several properties in 2024. 
 a 9.4 million decrease in non-same-store NOI driven by: 
 a decrease in office NOI of 11.7 million primarily resulting from the sales of our One Westside property in December 2023 and our 604 Arizona and 3401 Exposition properties in August 2023, partially offset by an increase due to new leases commencing at our Metro Center property during the first half of 2024; partially offset by 
 an increase in studio NOI of 2.3 million driven by increased activity at Quixote during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Income (Expenses) 
 
 Loss from unconsolidated real estate entities 
 
 We recorded a 3.2 million loss from unconsolidated real estate entities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by higher interest expense at the unconsolidated entities due to an increase in the average reference rates for variable rate debt and a mark-to-market adjustment for an interest rate swap that does not qualify for hedge accounting.

Table of Contents 

 Fee income 
 
 We recognized fee income of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fee income represents the management fee income earned from our unconsolidated real estate entities. The increase in fee income is primarily driven by an increase in construction activity at the Sunset Pier 94 Studios development during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Gross interest expense decreased by 4.2 million or 7.2 , to 53.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 57.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a repayment of the One Westside and Westside Two construction loan in December 2023, a decrease in the average outstanding borrowings on the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility and a repayment of the Series E notes in September 2023. The decrease was partially offset by interest on the loan secured by Sunset Glenoaks Studios, which became a consolidated property as of April 1, 2024. 
 
 Capitalized interest increased by 1.9 million or 22.3 , to 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by capitalized interest for the Sunset Glenoaks Studios and Washington 1000 development projects. 
 
 Non-cash interest expense decreased by 2.5 million, or 55.7 , to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-cash interest expense was primarily due to the amortization of mark-to-market gains related to the interest rate cap on our Hollywood Media Portfolio loan during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The cap expired in August 2023 and was accounted for under the mark-to-market approach until it was designated as a cash flow hedge in December 2022. Additionally, there was a decrease in deferred financing cost amortization due to the deferred financing costs related to the Hollywood Media Portfolio debt and the One Westside and Westside Two construction loan being fully amortized as of August 2023 and December 2023, respectively. 
 
 Unrealized loss on non-real estate investments 
 
 We recognized an unrealized loss on non-real estate investments of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which were due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments. 
 
 Gain on sale of real estate 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain on sale of 16.1 million attributable to the sales of our 604 Arizona and 3401 Exposition properties in August 2023. No gain or loss on sale was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Impairment loss 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment loss of 36.5 million due to a reduction in the estimated holding periods for certain office properties. We did not record any impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Income tax (provision) benefit 
 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 2.0 million, or 11.6 , to 19.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by lower capitalization of expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to less development activity as compared to the prior period, as well as an increase in information technology-related expenses and professional fees. The increase was partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 11.9 million, or 12.1 , to 86.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 98.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to the sale of the One Westside and Westside Two properties in December 2023, the non-recurring write-off of certain deferred leasing costs and tenant improvements in the third quarter of 2023 due to an early lease termination at our 1455 Market property and an impairment charge recorded for our Foothill Research Center property in December 2023, which decreased the depreciable basis of this property.

 NOI decreased 99.7 million, or 25.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from: 
 
 a 60.2 million decrease in same-store NOI driven by: 
 a decrease in office NOI of 56.8 million primarily due to: 
 a 52.3 million decrease in rental revenues driven by lease expirations at several properties in the San Francisco Bay Area during the last twelve months and a straight-line rent reserve related to transitioning a tenant to cash basis reporting, partially offset by a reversal of a previous straight-line rent reserve at our Hill7 property; and 
 a 3.9 million increase in operating expenses predominantly due to a prior-period property tax reimbursement at our ICON property during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and higher tax, insurance and utility expenses at several properties in 2024, partially offset by a reduction in variable ground rent expense at our Palo Alto Square property driven by the downsize of a large tenant; 
 a decrease in studio NOI of 3.4 million primarily due to a lease expiration at our Sunset Las Palmas Studios property, partially offset by increased production activity at our Sunset Gower Studios property during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 a 39.5 million decrease in non-same-store NOI driven by a decrease in office NOI of 39.1 million primarily resulting from the sales of our One Westside and Westside Two properties in December 2023 and our 604 Arizona and 3401 Exposition properties in August 2023, partially offset by an increase due to new leases commencing at our Metro Center property during the first half of 2024. 
 
 Other Income (Expenses) 
 
 Loss from unconsolidated real estate entities 
 
 We recorded a 6.4 million loss from unconsolidated real estate entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by higher 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 interest expense at the unconsolidated entities due to an increase in the average reference rates for variable rate debt and a mark-to-market adjustment for an interest rate swap that does not qualify for hedge accounting. 
 
 Fee income 
 
 We recognized fee income of 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Fee income represents the management fee income earned from our unconsolidated real estate entities. The primary reason for the decrease in fee income is due to less construction activity at the Sunset Waltham Cross Studios development during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 _________________ 
 1. Includes interest on the Company s debt and hedging activities. 
 2. Includes the amortization of deferred financing costs and fair market value adjustments for our mark-to-market interest rate derivatives. 
 
 Gross interest expense decreased by 8.2 million, or 4.9 , to 157.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 165.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a repayment of the One Westside and Westside Two construction loan in December 2023, the Quixote seller note in April 2023 and the Series E notes in September 2023, as well as a decrease in the average outstanding borrowings on the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility. The decrease was partially offset by interest on the loan secured by Sunset Glenoaks Studios, which became a consolidated property as of April 1, 2024. 
 
 Capitalized interest increased by 7.1 million, or 31.3 , to 29.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by capitalized interest for the Sunset Glenoaks Studios and Washington 1000 development projects. 
 
 Non-cash interest expense decreased by 13.5 million, or 69.6 , to 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-cash interest expense was primarily due to the amortization of mark-to-market gains related to the interest rate cap on our Hollywood Media Portfolio loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cap expired in August 2023 and was accounted for under the mark-to-market approach until it was designated as a cash flow hedge in December 2022. Additionally, there was a decrease in deferred financing cost amortization due to the deferred financing costs related to the Hollywood Media Portfolio debt and the One Westside and Westside Two construction loan being fully amortized as of August 2023 and December 2023, respectively. 
 
 Transaction-related expenses 
 
 Transaction-related expenses increased 3.7 million, or 271.6 , to 2.3 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to dead deal costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the remeasurement of the Zio earnout liability to fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Unrealized loss on non-real estate investments 
 
 We recognized an unrealized loss on our non-real estate investments of 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments. 
 
 Gain on sale of real estate 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a 23.2 million gain attributable to the sales of our 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 Skyway Landing property in February 2023 and 604 Arizona and 3401 Exposition properties in August 2023. No gain or loss on sale was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Impairment loss 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment loss of 36.5 million due to a reduction in the estimated holding periods for certain office properties. We did not record any impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a 10.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt due to the settlement of the Quixote note payable at a discount. No gain or loss on extinguishment of debt was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other income 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized other income of 1.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized other income of 0.1 million. The increase was primarily driven by the sale of a non-real estate investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income tax provision 
 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets. We recorded an income tax provision of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 mainly due to the tax impact of the gain on extinguishment of debt partially offset by a deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with net operating losses in certain of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 4.8 million, or 8.7 , to 60.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 55.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by lower capitalization of expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to less development activity as compared to the prior period, as well as an increase in information technology-related expenses and non-cash executive compensation expense. The increase was partially offset by lower travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 29.3 million, or 10.0 , to 265.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 294.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to the sale of our One Westside and Westside Two properties in December 2023, the non-recurring write-off of certain deferred leasing costs and tenant improvements in the third quarter of 2023 due to an early lease termination at our 1455 Market property and an impairment charge recorded for our Foothill Research Center property in December 2023, which decreased the depreciable basis of this property. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have remained capitalized since our initial public offering through public offerings, private placements, joint ventures and continuous offerings under our at-the-market ATM program. We currently expect that our principal sources of funds to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for working capital, strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures, tenant improvements, leasing costs, dividends and distributions, share repurchases and repayments of outstanding debt financing will include: 
 
 cash on hand, cash reserves and net cash provided by operations; 
 strategic dispositions of real estate; 
 sales of non-real estate investments; 
 proceeds from additional equity securities; 
 our ATM program; 
 borrowings under the operating partnership s unsecured revolving credit facility; 
 proceeds from joint venture partners; 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 proceeds from the Sunset Glenoaks Studios construction loan (consolidated joint venture), Sunset Pier 94 Studios construction loan (unconsolidated joint venture) and Bentall Centre loan (unconsolidated joint venture); and 
 proceeds from additional secured, unsecured debt financings or offerings. 
 
 Liquidity Sources 
 
 We had approximately 90.7 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024. Our principal source of operating cash flow is related to leasing and operating the properties in our portfolio. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution requirements. 
 
 Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us. 
 
 We have an ATM program that allows us to sell up to 125.0 million of common stock, 65.8 million of which has been sold through September 30, 2024. Any future sales will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs. We have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under this program.

 3. The loan was transacted in Canadian dollars. Amounts are shown in U.S. dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase. In addition, our ability to incur additional debt may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Certain of the major U.S. credit rating agencies have previously downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to non-investment grade. These and any further ratings downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt. As of September 30, 2024, the credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt were Ba3, BB- and BB- from Moody s, Standard and Poor s and Fitch, respectively.

 The operating partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants as of September 30, 2024, although there can be no assurance that it will continue to be in compliance with these financial covenants. Our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, including general economic conditions; fluctuations in interest rates and increased operating costs; our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, including as a result of further downgrades in the credit ratings of our unsecured indebtedness; our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness, repay indebtedness when due and maintain dividend payments; and strikes or work stoppages. Failure to meet any of these covenants could cause an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness. In addition, certain of our indebtedness contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances.

 164,495 223,038 (58,543) (26.2) Net cash used in investing activities (195,756) (124,505) (71,251) 57.2 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 26,040 (290,170) 316,210 (109.0) 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 113.9 million and 119.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 58.5 million, or 26.2 , to 164.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 223.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily resulted from the property dispositions throughout 2023 and a significant tenant move-out at our 1455 Market property in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 71.3 million, or 57.2 , to 195.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 124.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change primarily resulted from 167.0 million of proceeds from sales of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no sales of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change was partially offset by a 92.6 million decrease in

 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.0 million compared to 290.2 million of net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change primarily resulted from a 487.0 million decrease in payments of unsecured and secured debt, a 39.6 million decrease in dividends paid to common stock and unitholders and a 29.9 million decrease in distributions to non-controlling members in consolidated real estate entities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was partially offset by a 201.6 million decrease in proceeds from unsecured and secured debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 40.9 million spent to purchase our partner s interest in our 1455 Market property during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates of certain items and judgments as to certain future events, for example with respect to the assignment of the purchase price of an acquired property among land, buildings, improvements, equipment and any related intangible assets and liabilities, or the effect of a property tax reassessment of our properties. These determinations, even though inherently subjective and prone to change, affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. While we believe that our estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and judgments at the time they are made, some of our assumptions, estimates and judgments will inevitably prove to be incorrect. As a result, actual outcomes will likely differ from our accruals and those differences positive or negative could be material. Some of our accruals are subject to adjustment, as we believe appropriate, based on revised estimates and reconciliation to the actual results when available. 
 
 Refer to Part I, Item 1 Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for information regarding our critical accounting policies. 

Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: Funds From Operations 
 
 We calculate FFO in accordance with the White Paper issued in December 2018 on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets) and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The calculation of FFO includes the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements and excludes the depreciation of the related tenant improvement assets. In the December 2018 White Paper, NAREIT provided an option to include value changes in mark-to-market equity securities in the calculation of FFO. We elected this option retroactively during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 
 We believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. The exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. Also, because FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs, it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, and accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs. 
 
 Implicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, we believe that FFO along with the required GAAP presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide. We use FFO per share to calculate annual cash bonuses for certain employees. 
 
 However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. 
 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to FFO (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss (107,013) (35,752) (207,925) (82,046) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization consolidated 86,672 98,580 265,324 294,654 Depreciation and amortization non-real estate assets (8,031) (8,300) (24,223) (25,524) Depreciation and amortization HPP s share from unconsolidated real estate entities 1,231 1,165 4,388 3,623 Gain on sale of real estate (16,108) (23,154) Impairment loss real estate assets 36,543 36,543 Unrealized loss on non-real estate investments 1,081 2,265 3,024 2,269 FFO attributable to non-controlling interests 1,508 (10,509) (9,601) (37,371) FFO attributable to preferred shares and units (5,200) (5,200) (15,600) (15,600) FFO TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS 6,791 26,141 51,930 116,851
