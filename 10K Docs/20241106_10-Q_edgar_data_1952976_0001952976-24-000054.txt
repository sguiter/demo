Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report ), including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 2 of Part I of this Report, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: our corporate strategy and estimated or future economic performance and results, including our expectations surrounding the impact of the broader macroeconomic environment and the ability of tenants to pay rent, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects; our future capital expenditure and leverage levels, debt service obligations, and plans to fund our liquidity needs, including our ability to sell or dispose of properties; prospective statements regarding our access to the capital markets; statements that we make regarding our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust REIT and the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory activity. 
 
 These statements are based on the current expectations of our management. It is important to note that our actual results could be materially different from those projected in such forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable risks or uncertainties, like the risks related to inflation and increased interest rates, the effects of pandemics and global outbreaks of contagious diseases, and domestic or geopolitical crises, such as terrorism, military conflict, war or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, political instability or civil unrest, or other conflict, could also have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects. You should exercise caution in relying on forward-looking statements as they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may materially affect our future results, performance, achievements, or transactions. Information on factors that could impact actual results and cause them to differ from what is anticipated in the forward-looking statements contained herein is included in this Report, as well as in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report ). Moreover, because we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, new risks are likely to emerge from time to time. Given these risks and uncertainties, potential investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a prediction of future results, which speak only as of the date of this Report, unless noted otherwise. Except as required by federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not undertake to revise or update any forward-looking statements.

The carrying value of the NLOP Mezzanine Loan, net Note 9 includes unamortized deferred financing costs of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The carrying value of Non-recourse mortgages, net includes unamortized deferred financing costs of less than million at December 31, 2023.

The carrying value of Non-recourse mortgages, net includes unamortized premium of million and unamortized discount of million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (c) We determined the estimated fair value of our NLOP Mortgage Loan, NLOP Mezzanine Loan, and non-recourse mortgage loans using a discounted cash flow model that estimates the present value of the future loan payments by discounting such payments at current estimated market interest rates. The estimated market interest rates consider interest rate risk and the value of the underlying collateral, which includes quality of the collateral, the credit quality of the tenant/obligor, and the time until maturity. 
 
 We estimated that our other financial assets and liabilities, excluding finance receivables Note 5 ), had fair values that approximated their carrying values at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis (Including Impairment Charges) 
 
 We periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate investments may be impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. There have been no significant changes in our impairment policies from what was disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report.

One of these properties was sold in August and one was sold in October 2024 Note 15 ). 
 
 Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of million on a property due to changes in expected cash flows related to the existing tenant s lease expiration in 2025, in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value. The fair value measurement for this property was determined by using the following unobservable inputs:

 We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding our financial statements and the reasons for changes in certain key components of our financial statements from period to period. This item also provides our perspective on our financial position and liquidity, as well as certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Annual Report and subsequent reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Refer to Item 1 of the 2023 Annual Report for a description of our business. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 Prior to the Spin-Off 
 
 The historical results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of NLOP prior to the Spin-Off do not represent the historical results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of a legal entity, but rather a combination of entities under common control that have been carved-out of WPC s consolidated financial statements and presented herein, in each case, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in combination. The preparation of the financial results of NLOP prior to the Spin-Off required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the relevant reporting periods and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 The financial results of NLOP prior to the Spin-Off reflect the revenues and direct expenses of NLOP and include material assets and liabilities of WPC that are specifically attributable to NLOP. Equity represents the excess of total assets over total liabilities. Equity is impacted by contributions from and distributions to WPC, which are the result of treasury activities and net funding provided by or distributed to WPC prior to the Separation, as well as the allocated costs and expenses. 
 
 The financial results of NLOP prior to the Spin-Off also include an allocation of indirect costs and expenses incurred by WPC related to NLOP, primarily consisting of compensation and other general and administrative costs using the relative percentage of property revenue of NLOP and WPC management s knowledge of NLOP. In addition, the financial results reflect the allocation of interest expense from WPC unsecured debt, excluding debt that is specifically attributable to NLOP; interest expense was allocated by calculating the unencumbered net investment in real estate of each property held by NLOP as a percentage of WPC s total consolidated unencumbered net investment in real estate and multiplying that percentage by the interest expense on WPC unsecured debt. The amounts allocated in the financial results of NLOP prior to the Spin-Off are not necessarily indicative of the actual amount of such indirect expenses that would have been recorded had the NLOP been a separate independent entity during the applicable periods. NLOP believes the assumptions underlying NLOP s allocation of indirect expenses prior to the Spin-Off are reasonable. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 
 NLOP is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the JOBS Act ), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in NLOP s periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 
 Net Lease Office Properties 9/30/2024 10-Q 25 

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. NLOP has elected to take advantage of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, NLOP, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of NLOP s financial statements with certain other public companies difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 
 NLOP will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Spin-Off, (b) in which NLOP has total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which NLOP is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the common equity of NLOP that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter; and (ii) the date on which NLOP has issued more than 1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

 Property Expenses, Excluding Reimbursable Tenant Costs 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, property expenses, excluding reimbursable tenant costs, increased by 0.7 million and 1.5 million, respectively, primarily due to tenant vacancies during the current year periods (which resulted in property expenses no longer being reimbursable). 
 
 Net Lease Office Properties 9/30/2024 10-Q 30 

General and Administrative 
 
 Prior to the Spin-Off on November 1, 2023 Note 1 ), General and administrative expenses were allocated to NLOP based on the relative percentage of annualized based rent of NLOP. The amounts allocated are not necessarily indicative of the actual amount of indirect expenses that would have been recorded had NLOP been a separate independent entity. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.6 million and 4.4 million, respectively, primarily since the current year periods represents actual direct expenses incurred (including 1.0 million and 3.0 million, respectively, of administrative reimbursements paid to our Advisor Note 3 )), compared to the allocation of expenses described above for the prior year periods. 
 
 Asset Management Fees 
 
 Upon completion of the Spin-Off on November 1, 2023 Note 1 ), we began paying asset management fees to our Advisor, which totaled 1.5 million and 4.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively Note 3 ). 
 
 Separation and Distribution Related Costs and Other 
 
 Separation and distribution related costs and other are comprised of costs related to the Spin-Off for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense is comprised of interest on Non-recourse mortgages, our NLOP Mortgage Loan, and our NLOP Mezzanine Loan, as well as interest expense on Parent debt specific to NLOP properties and that was allocated to NLOP based on the relative percentage of unencumbered net investment in real estate of each property compared to WPC (prior to the Spin-Off). The amounts allocated to Parent debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the actual amount of interest expense that would have been recorded had NLOP been a separate independent entity during the applicable periods. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, interest expense increased by 3.7 million and 35.9 million, respectively, primarily due to the 455.0 million of NLOP Financing Arrangements entered into during the fourth quarter of 2023 Note 9 ). 
 
 (Loss) Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net 
 
 (Loss) gain on sale of real estate, net, consists of gain on the sale of properties that were disposed of during the reporting period, as more fully described in Note 4 , Note 5 , and Note 13 .

Other Gains and (Losses) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other gains and (losses) of 0.4 million were primarily comprised of (i) interest income on our cash deposits of 0.7 million, (ii) net realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange rate movements of 0.1 million, and (iii) net realized and unrealized losses on our interest rate cap derivative of 0.4) million Note 8 ). 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other gains and (losses) of (0.1) million were primarily comprised of (i) net realized and unrealized losses on our interest rate cap derivative of 1.0) million Note 8 ), (ii) net realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange rate movements of 0.5) million, (iii) a loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.3) million Note 9 ), and (iv) interest income on our cash deposits of 1.7 million. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, other gains and (losses) were immaterial. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, provision for income taxes increased by 0.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively, primarily due to net income recognized on a taxable entity during the current year periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash During the Period 
 
 We use the cash flow generated from our investments primarily to meet our operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service. Our cash flows fluctuate periodically due to a number of factors, which may include, among other things: the timing of capital expenditures and sales of real estate; the timing of the repayment of debt and receipt of lease revenues; the timing and amount of other lease-related payments; and the timing of advisory fees and reimbursements paid to our Advisor. Despite these fluctuations, we believe that we will generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our normal recurring short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We may also use existing cash resources and proceeds from dispositions of properties in order to meet these needs. We assess our ability to access capital on an ongoing basis. The following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 61,378 63,869 (2,491) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 254,695 (4,617) 259,312 Net cash used in financing activities (298,108) (59,016) (239,092) 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 2.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense and the impact of dispositions, partially offset by 10.3 million of proceeds received from the sale of a net investment in sales-type lease during the current year period Note 5 ). 
 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased by 259.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to proceeds from dispositions during the current year period. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased by 239.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher payments of the NLOP Financing Arrangements and mortgage principal.

 __________ 
 (a) Aggregate debt balance includes unamortized discount, net, totaling 3.4 million and 21.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and unamortized deferred financing costs totaling 1.6 million and 9.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 In connection with the Spin-Off, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into the NLOP Financing Arrangements, comprised of the NLOP Mortgage Loan and NLOP Mezzanine Loan Note 9 ). The NLOP Financing Arrangements are collateralized by the assignment of certain of our previously unencumbered real estate properties. Additionally, property sales are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including satisfaction of a debt yield test and minimum release prices. We are required to use the net proceeds from property sales collateralizing the NLOP Financing Arrangements to repay the portions of the NLOP Mortgage Loan and NLOP Mezzanine Loan representing the release amount for any individual property sale, with excess net proceeds, if any, used to repay the NLOP Mortgage Loan. 
 
 The NLOP Mortgage Loan was subject to certain deleveraging thresholds that required us to make repayments on the original loan balance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid 239.8 million and 34.6 million of outstanding principal on the NLOP Mortgage Loan and NLOP Mezzanine Loan, respectively, using proceeds from certain dispositions and lease terminations, as well as excess cash from operations. As a result of these repayments, we reached (i) the first deleveraging threshold, which was repayments on the original loan balance totaling 15 (or 50.3 million) on or prior to November 1, 2024, (ii) the second deleveraging threshold, which was repayments on the original loan balance totaling 25 (or 83.8 million) on or prior to November 1, 2025, such that 40 of the loan has been repaid, and (iii) the third and final deleveraging threshold, which was repayments on the original loan balance totaling 30 (or 100.5 million) on or prior to November 1, 2026, such that 70 of the loan has been repaid Note 9 ). At September 30, 2024, we had 49.1 million and 79.7 million total principal outstanding on the NLOP Mortgage Loan and NLOP Mezzanine Loan, respectively. In October 2024, we repaid 10.0 million of outstanding principal on the NLOP Mortgage Loan using disposition proceeds and excess cash from operations Note 15 ). 
 
 Net Lease Office Properties 9/30/2024 10-Q 33 

Cash Resources 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash resources consisted of the following: 
 
 cash and cash equivalents totaling 36.1 million. Of this amount, 10.2 million, at then-current exchange rates, was held in foreign subsidiaries, and we could be subject to restrictions or significant costs should we decide to repatriate these amounts; and 
 unleveraged properties that had an aggregate asset carrying value of approximately 83.7 million at September 30, 2024, although there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain financing for these properties. 
 
 Cash Requirements and Liquidity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, scheduled debt principal payments total 0.3 million during the remainder of 2024 and 157.0 million during 2025 Note 9 ). 
 
 During the next 12 months following September 30, 2024 and thereafter, we expect that our significant cash requirements will include: 
 
 making scheduled principal and balloon payments on our non-recourse mortgage debt obligations, totaling 115.6 million, with 66.6 million due during the next 12 months; 
 making scheduled interest payments on our non-recourse mortgage obligations (future interest payments total 8.5 million, with 5.9 million due during the next 12 months); 
 making scheduled principal payments on the NLOP Financing Arrangements, totaling 128.8 million (no amounts are due during the next 12 months); 
 making scheduled interest payments on the NLOP Financing Arrangements (future interest payments total 55.1 million, with 16.6 million due during the next 12 months); includes 4.5 payment-in-kind interest on the NLOP Mezzanine Loan that we have the option to capitalize into the principal balance; 
 funding future capital commitments and tenant improvement allowances; and 
 other normal recurring operating expenses. 
 
 We expect to fund these cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash received from dispositions of properties. 
 
 Our liquidity could be adversely affected by refinancing debt at higher interest rates, unanticipated costs, and greater-than-anticipated operating expenses. 
 
 Certain amounts disclosed above are based on the applicable foreign currency exchange rate at September 30, 2024. 

Supplemental Financial Measures 
 
 In the real estate industry, analysts and investors employ certain non-GAAP supplemental financial measures in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons between periods and among peer companies. Additionally, in the formulation of our goals and in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our strategies, we use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP measures defined by our management. We believe that these measures are useful to investors to consider because they may assist them to better understand and measure the performance of our business over time and against similar companies. A description of FFO and AFFO and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided below. 
 
 Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 
 Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a non-GAAP measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure, when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental non-GAAP measure. FFO is not equivalent to, nor a substitute for, net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
 
 Net Lease Office Properties 9/30/2024 10-Q 34 

We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in December 2018. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from the sale of certain real estate, impairment charges on real estate or other assets incidental to the company s main business, gains or losses on changes in control of interests in real estate, and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets; and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
 
 We also modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to adjust GAAP net income for certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of real estate-related intangibles, deferred income tax benefits and expenses, straight-line rent and related reserves, other non-cash rent adjustments, non-cash allowance for credit losses on finance leases, stock-based compensation, non-cash environmental accretion expense, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt, and amortization of deferred financing costs. Our assessment of our operations is focused on long-term sustainability and not on such non-cash items, which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on cash flows. Additionally, we exclude non-core income and expenses, such as gains or losses from extinguishment of debt, merger and acquisition expenses, and spin-off expenses. We also exclude realized and unrealized gains/losses on foreign currency exchange rate movements, which are not considered fundamental attributes of our business plan and do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. We refer to our modified definition of FFO as AFFO. We exclude these items from GAAP net income to arrive at AFFO as they are not the primary drivers in our decision-making process and excluding these items provides investors a view of our portfolio performance over time and makes it more comparable to other REITs. AFFO also reflects adjustments for jointly owned investments. We use AFFO as one measure of our operating performance when we formulate corporate goals and evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies. 
 
 We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider as we believe it will help them to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance without the potentially distorting impact of these short-term fluctuations. However, there are limits on the usefulness of AFFO to investors. For example, impairment charges and unrealized foreign currency losses that we exclude may become actual realized losses upon the ultimate disposition of the properties in the form of lower cash proceeds or other considerations. We use our FFO and AFFO measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance. We do not use our FFO and AFFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net income computed under GAAP, or as alternatives to net cash provided by operating activities computed under GAAP, or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.

 (b) Primarily comprised of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, and foreign currency transactions. 
 (c) Amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are comprised of costs related to the Spin-Off. 
 
 While we believe that FFO and AFFO are important supplemental measures, they should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of a company s operating performance. These non-GAAP measures should be used in conjunction with net income as defined by GAAP. FFO and AFFO, or similarly titled measures disclosed by other REITs, may not be comparable to our FFO and AFFO measures.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. 
 
 We are also exposed to further market risk as a result of tenant concentrations in certain industries and/or geographic regions, since adverse market factors can affect the ability of tenants in a particular industry/region to meet their respective lease obligations. In order to manage this risk, we view our collective tenant roster as a portfolio and we attempt to diversify such portfolio so that we are not overexposed to a particular industry or geographic region. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The values of our real estate and related fixed-rate debt obligations are subject to fluctuations based on changes in interest rates. The value of our real estate is also subject to fluctuations based on local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees, which may affect our ability to refinance debt when balloon payments are scheduled, if we do not choose to repay the debt when due. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. An increase in interest rates would likely cause the fair value of our assets to decrease. Increases in interest rates may also have an impact on the credit profile of certain tenants. 
 
 We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund the financing and refinancing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our profitability and the value of our real estate investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes. 
 
 We have borrowed funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect future earnings or cash flows on fixed rate debt unless such debt matures or is otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of fixed rate instruments. Movements in interest rates on variable rate debt could change future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of the debt. However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of variable rate instruments. We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, interest rate cap agreements with counterparties related to certain of our variable-rate debt. See Note 8 for additional information on our interest rate caps. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, fixed-rate debt comprises 62 of our debt and variable-rate debt comprises 38 . 
 
 Our debt obligations are more fully described in Note 9 and Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary of Financing in Item 2 above. The following table presents principal cash flows based upon expected maturity dates of our debt obligations outstanding at September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 2024 (Remainder) 
 2025 2026 2027 2028 Total Fair Value Fixed-rate debt (a) 
 334 66,325 7,379 79,716 153,754 147,445 Variable-rate debt (a) 
 90,690 90,690 87,599 
 __________ 
 (a) Amounts are based on the exchange rate at September 30, 2024, as applicable. 
 
 Annual interest expense on our variable-rate debt at September 30, 2024 would increase or decrease by 0.9 million, for each respective 1 change in annual interest rates. 
 
 Net Lease Office Properties 9/30/2024 10-Q 37 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 We own international investments in Europe, and as a result are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in three foreign currencies, primarily the Norwegian krone, which may affect future costs and cash flows. We have obtained, and may in the future obtain, non-recourse mortgage financing in the local currency. Volatile market conditions arising from macroeconomic factors, may result in significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To the extent that currency fluctuations increase or decrease rental revenues, as translated to U.S. dollars, the change in debt service (comprised of principal and interest, excluding balloon payments), as translated to U.S. dollars, will partially offset the effect of fluctuations in revenue and, to some extent, mitigate the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We estimate that, for a 1 increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the Norwegian krone, British pound sterling, or euro and the U.S. dollar, there would be a corresponding change in the projected estimated cash flow (scheduled future rental revenues, net of scheduled future debt service payments for the next 12 months) for our consolidated foreign operations at September 30, 2024 of less than 0.1 million for all three currencies. 
 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 
 Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. The Company is subject to tenant, geographic and industry concentrations. Any downturn of the economic conditions in one or more of these tenants, geographies or industries could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to us. 
 
 The factors we consider in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We believe that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality and diversity of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated portfolio had the following significant characteristics in excess of 10 , based on the percentage of our consolidated total revenues: 
 
 93 related to domestic operations; which included concentrations of 33 and 21 in Texas and Minnesota, respectively.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures include internal controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this and other reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. It should be noted that no system of controls can provide complete assurance of achieving a company s objectives and that future events may impact the effectiveness of a system of controls. 
 
 Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after conducting an evaluation, together with members of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024 at a reasonable level of assurance. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
