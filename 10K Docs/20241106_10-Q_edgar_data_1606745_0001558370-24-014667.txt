Dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be paid, at TripCo s election, in cash, shares of LTRPA, or, at the election of the Purchaser, shares of the Company s Series C common stock LTRPK ), provided, in each case, such shares are listed on a national securities exchange and are actively traded (such LTRPK shares, together with the LTRPA shares, the Eligible Common Stock ), or a combination of cash and Eligible Common Stock. If a dividend is not declared and paid on the dividend payment date, the dividend amount will be added to the then-applicable liquidation price of the Series A Preferred Stock. Redemption The Company is required to redeem for cash shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the earlier of (i) the first business day after the fifth anniversary of March 26, 2020, or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, a change in control of TripCo.

 business days prior to the date of TripCo s notice of repurchase) minus (ii) all dividends paid in cash or shares of Eligible Common Stock on such share through the optional repurchase date. Restriction on transfer of Series A Preferred Stock Subject to exceptions contained in the Investment Agreement and the Repurchase Agreement, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock generally are non-transferable; provided that TripCo has agreed not to unreasonably withhold its consent to certain transfers of up to of the remaining Series A Preferred Shares outstanding following the repurchases from Certares under the Repurchase Agreement (so long as there are no more than holders of the Series A Preferred Stock at any one time). Any transferee of shares of Series A Preferred Stock must agree to the permanent waiver of the Put Option, to the permanent waiver of the right to appoint the Series A Preferred Threshold Director (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designations and described in the Repurchase Agreement) and to the Call Right. Recognition Prior to the partial redemption, as the Series A Preferred Stock was redeemable and the redemption triggers were outside of TripCo s control, the Company was required to classify the shares outside of permanent equity. The Company calculated the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Redemption Price calculation, and any changes in the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock were recorded directly to retained earnings. Immediately prior to the partial redemption, the Company recognized a million decrease to retained earnings related to the value of the Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of the Repurchase Agreement, the Series A Preferred Stock may no longer be settled in shares of TripCo or TRIP common stock and the Purchaser no longer has the ability to participate on the TripCo board of directors purely through ownership of Series A Preferred Stock. Following an evaluation of the accounting impact of these changes, we concluded the Series A Preferred Stock is a debt host with an equity-indexed derivative that is required to be bifurcated. Accordingly, the Series A Preferred Stock was required to be measured at fair value, through retained earnings, in connection with the reclassification from temporary equity to a liability. The fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock was estimated to be million lower than its redemption value and such amount was recorded as an increase to retained earnings. The debt host component is included in Series A Preferred Stock liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be accreted through interest expense to the amount to be paid upon settlement. The Preferred Stock Derivative is recorded at fair value and is included in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and in financial instrument liabilities as of December 31, 2023 in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the debt host component was million, based on the present value of the liquidation price on the redemption date (Level 2). vote per share, LTRPB entitles the holders to votes per share and LTRPK,

For segment reporting purposes, TripCo defines Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation), adjusted for specifically identified non-recurring transactions. TripCo believes this measure is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses, by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results, and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes depreciation and amortization, equity settled liabilities (including stock-based compensation), separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. TripCo generally accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current prices.

The following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Overview The accompanying financial statements and the other information herein refer to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. and its controlled subsidiaries as TripCo, Consolidated TripCo, the Company, us, we and our unless the context otherwise requires. We own an approximate 21 economic interest and 57 voting interest in Tripadvisor as of

 September 30, 2024. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. TripCo has several obligations due within twelve months that cause substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. See further discussion in note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Trends The online travel industry in which Tripadvisor operates is large, highly dynamic and competitive. Current trends affecting Tripadvisor s overall business and segments, including uncertainties that may impact its ability to execute on its objectives and strategies, are described below. Public health-related events, such as a pandemic, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, including the evolving events in the Middle East, acts of terrorism, fluctuations in currency values, and changes in global economic conditions are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry and as a result, Tripadvisor s financial results in the future. Prior to Google introducing changes to its search engine results page, Tripadvisor generated a significant amount of direct traffic from search engines, including Google, through strong search engine optimization SEO performance across all segments. Tripadvisor believes its SEO traffic acquisition performance has been negatively impacted in the past, and may be impacted in the future, by metasearch and search engines (primarily Google) changing their search result placement and underlying algorithms, including to increase the prominence of their own products in search results across its business, most notably within its hotel meta offering within the Brand Tripadvisor segment. In response to the large underpenetrated market for experiences, Viator continues to invest in marketing to drive awareness and grow market share. Over the long-term, Tripadvisor is focused on driving a greater percentage of its bookings from direct channels. Tripadvisor is doing this by continuing to focus on increasing its brand recognition and improving the user experience across products on its website and mobile app, providing high-quality customer service, and offering leading customer choice for online bookable experiences supply. The global experiences market is large, growing, and highly fragmented, with the vast majority of bookings still occurring through traditional offline sources. Tripadvisor is observing a secular shift, however, as this market continues to grow and accelerate the pace of online adoption. Likewise, the global restaurants category is also benefiting from increased online adoption by both consumers and partners, particularly in Europe. Given the competitive positioning of Tripadvisor s businesses relative to the attractive growth prospects in the experiences and restaurant categories, Tripadvisor expects to continue to invest in these categories across the business and, in particular, within the Viator and TheFork segments, to continue accelerating revenue growth, operating scale, and market share gains for the long-term. Due to recent goodwill and trademark impairments related to the Brand Tripadvisor reporting unit (formerly Tripadvisor Core reporting unit), the fair values of such intangible assets do not significantly exceed their respective carrying values. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor s current business performance versus the current and updated long-term forecasts, among other relevant considerations, to determine if the carrying value of its assets (including Goodwill and Trademarks) is appropriate. Future outlook declines in revenue, cash flows, or other factors could result in a sustained decrease in fair value that may result in a determination that carrying value adjustments are required, which could be material. Recent Developments As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in August 2023, Tripadvisor received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2014 through 2016 tax years relating to certain transfer pricing arrangements with its foreign subsidiaries. In response, Tripadvisor requested competent authority assistance under Mutual Agreement Procedure MAP for the 2014 through 2016 tax years. In January 2024, Tripadvisor received notification of a MAP resolution agreement for the 2014 through 2016 tax years, which it accepted in February 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Tripadvisor recorded an income tax benefit of 4 million and an income tax expense of 41 million, respectively, as discrete items, inclusive of interest, related to this settlement

 Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue decreased 30 million and 64 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in Tripadvisor s hotel meta revenue and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in hotel business to business revenue, as Tripadvisor transitions from a sales-led model to a self-service model. The decrease in Tripadvisor s hotel meta revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily driven by continued headwinds impacting free channels, including SEO traffic, contributing to a decrease in click volumes, and to a lesser extent, a deceleration in cost-per-click rates, particularly in the U.S. The decrease in Tripadvisor s hotel meta revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, w as driven by declines in U.S. hotel meta revenue and, to a lesser extent, European hotel meta revenue, primarily due to weaker demand related to increased competition in paid online marketing channels and continued headwinds impacting free channels, including SEO traffic, during the second and third quarters of 2024, contributing to a decrease in click volumes. Media and advertising revenue consists of revenue from display-based advertising (or media advertising across Tripadvisor s platform. Media and advertising revenue increased 2 million and 4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to an increase in overall advertising campaigns and pricing . Tripadvisor experiences and dining revenue includes intercompany (intersegment) revenue and external revenue generated from Tripadvisor s restaurant service offerings. The intercompany revenue consists of affiliate marketing commissions earned primarily from experience bookings and, to a lesser extent, restaurant reservation bookings, on Tripadvisor-branded websites and mobile apps fulfilled by Viator and TheFork, respectively, and is eliminated on a consolidated basis. Tripadvisor experiences and dining revenue decreased 4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decline in dining revenue as Tripadvisor moves from a sales-led model to a self-service model, and, to a lesser extent, some deceleration in experiences growth during the third quarter of 2024, as Tripadvisor s near-term segment marketing strategy emphasizes profitability. Tripadvisor experiences and dining revenue decreased 3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decline in dining revenue as Tripadvisor moves from a sales-led model to a self-service model, as noted above, partially offset by an increase in experiences revenue, despite some deceleration in experiences revenue growth, as noted above, during the second and third quarters of 2024. Other revenue includes alternative accommodation rentals revenue, in addition to click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue from cruise, flights and rental cars offerings on Tripadvisor websites and mobile apps. Other revenue decreased 3 million and 5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decline in alternative accommodation rentals revenue, as Tripadvisor continues to strategically de-emphasize this offering.

 Viator revenue increased 25 million and 79 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by consumer demand for experiences across all geographies, driving growth in bookings, partially offset by some deceleration in revenue growth in the Brand Tripadvisor point-of-sale during the second and third quarters of 2024, as noted above . Tripadvisor continues to believe that Viator is also benefiting from a larger macro trend, as the large global market in which it operates continues to grow and migrate online from traditional offline sources. TheFork revenue increased 7 million and 18 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by increased consumer demand for dining in Europe, including increased bookings and pricing. In addition, Tripadvisor estimates this segment s revenue growth rate was positively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 2 during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023. Operating expense. Operating expense increased 8 million and 26 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to cost of revenue increases of 4 million and 15 million, respectively. The increase in cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to increased direct costs from credit card payment processing fees and other revenue-related transaction costs in the Viator segment in direct correlation with an increase in revenue, as Viator serves as the merchant of record for the significant majority of its experience booking transactions. The increase in cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to increased direct costs from credit card payment processing fees and other revenue-related transaction costs in the Viator segment, as noted above, as well as increased direct revenue generation costs related to data center costs and media production costs in the Brand Tripadvisor segment. Additionally, technology and content costs increased 4 million and 11 million, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher personnel and overhead costs in the Brand Tripadvisor and Viator segments, in support of product development, and in addition, increased licensing costs. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 2 million and remained flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily driven by an 8 million decrease in Brand Tripadvisor s overall marketing costs, partially offset by a 4 million increase in overall marketing costs in the Viator segment, in order to capture consumer demand, including increased investment within the Viator segment to focus on growing market share, acquiring new customers, and driving brand awareness. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in the prior year, a 28 million decrease in overall marketing costs in the Brand Tripadvisor segment was offset by a 21 million increase in overall marketing costs in the Viator segment, and a 10 million accrual for the potential settlement of a regulatory related matter during the first quarter of 2024 (as discussed in note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements). Operating Income (Loss). Operating income increased 1,031 million and 1,023 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to the impairments recorded to goodwill and intangible assets during the three months ended September 30, 2023, as well as the above explanations. Adjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as Operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our business and make decisions about our resources. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered

During the second quarter of 2024 Tripadvisor recorded a one-time charge of 4 million to general and administrative, including stock-based compensation on the condensed consolidated statement of operations, resulting from legislation enacted in Canada during June 2024 related to digital services taxes, which requires retrospective application back to January 1, 2022. This amount represents the one-time retrospective liability for the periods prior to April 1, 2024, while any liability subsequent to April 1, 2024 is included within Adjusted OIBDA. (2) During the third quarter of 2023, Tripadvisor initiated a restructuring and reduced global headcount. Tripadvisor expects the majority of remaining unpaid restructuring costs as of September 30, 2024 to be disbursed during 2024. (3) Tripadvisor expensed 1 million and 4 million of transaction costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 3 million of transaction costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to selling, general and administrative, including stock-based compensation on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Tripadvisor considers such costs to be non-recurring in nature. Adjusted OIBDA is summarized as follows:

Brand Tripadvisor Adjusted OIBDA decreased 24 million and 31 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, while Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased 4 and 1 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. The decline in Adjusted OIBDA was primarily due to a decrease in revenue, as noted above, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the

Table of Contents 
 segment's operating expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, of 11 million and 37 million, respectively, primarily related to a decrease in direct selling and marketing expenses, primarily paid online traffic acquisition costs, and to a lesser extent a decrease in overall personnel and overhead costs. The decrease in Adjusted OIBDA margin during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, was largely due to an increase in technology and content personnel and overhead costs, and to a lesser extent, an increase in direct costs within cost of revenue, as a percent of revenue. Viator Adjusted OIBDA improved 13 million and 28 million, while Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 4 and 5 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to increased leverage as Tripadvisor scales the business and drives a greater number of bookings from more profitable repeat customers. These improvements were partially offset by Tripadvisor s continued investment in marketing, primarily paid online traffic acquisition costs, in response to consumer demand for experiences and increased investment focusing on growing market share, acquiring new customers, and driving brand awareness. In addition, increased personnel and overhead costs to support business growth and invest in Tripadvisor s product experience and, to a lesser extent, increased licensing costs, and an increase in revenue generation costs resulting from credit card payments in direct correlation with the increase in revenue, all negatively impacted Adjusted OIBDA. The improvements in Adjusted OIBDA margin were primarily due to a decrease in selling and marketing costs as a percent of revenue. TheFork Adjusted OIBDA improved 6 million and 19 million, while Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 12 and 16 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The improvements in Adjusted OIBDA were primarily due to increases in revenue, as noted above, and lower personnel and overhead costs. The improvements in Adjusted OIBDA margin were primarily due to lower personnel and overhead costs as a percent of revenue. Corporate Adjusted OIBDA includes TripCo level selling, general and administrative expenses. Corporate Adjusted OIBDA loss remained relatively flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in the prior year. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. TripCo recorded goodwill impairments of 820 million and trademark impairments of 205 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the Brand Tripadvisor reporting unit. Restructuring and other related reorganization costs (benefits). Tripadvisor incurred restructuring and other related reorganization benefits of 1 million and costs of 1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 18 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These costs (benefits) consisted primarily of employee severance and related benefits. Interest expense. Interest expense increased 2 million and 3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to Tripadvisor s issuance of the Term Loan B Facility in July 2024, which increased Tripadvisor s cost of capital. Dividend and interest income. Dividend and interest income remained flat and increased 3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the average amount of cash invested.

Realized and unrealized gains on financial instruments, net increased 11 million and 13 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increased unrealized gains in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily due to increases in unrealized gains related to the variable prepaid forward (defined in note 4 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) of 9 million and 12 million, respectively, and decreases in unrealized losses related to the TripCo Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2051 of 3 million and 4 million, respectively. Other, net. Other, net expense remained flat and increased 2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily driven by losses on disposals of assets and a loss on early extinguishment of debt at Tripadvisor, partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange losses at Tripadvisor. Income taxes. Earnings (loss) before income taxes, income tax (expense) benefit, and the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 amounts in millions Earnings (loss) before income taxes 62 (978) 74 (960) Income tax (expense) benefit (27) 14 (84) (63) Effective tax rate 44 1 114 (7) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s tax rate was higher than the expected federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to unfavorable stock-based compensation tax effects. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s tax rate was lower than the expected federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to goodwill impairments that are not deductible for tax purposes and unfavorable stock-based compensation tax effects . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s tax rate was higher than the expected federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to Tripadvisor s IRS settlement on its 2014-2016 transfer pricing audit (see note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s tax rate was lower than the expected federal tax rate of 21 primarily related to goodwill impairments that are not deductible for tax purposes, and Tripadvisor s settlement with the IRS on its 2009-2011 transfer pricing audit and changes in unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the IRS settlement. Net earnings (loss). We had net income of 35 million and net losses of 964 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net losses of 10 million and 1,023 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes in net earnings (loss) were the result of the above described fluctuations in our revenue and expenses.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand in global financial institutions, money market funds and marketable securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. The following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, monetization of our investments, outstanding or anticipated debt facilities, debt and equity issuances, and dividend and interest receipts. As of September 30, 2024, TripCo had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 1,127 million. Approximately 1,112 million of the cash balance, at September 30, 2024, is held at Tripadvisor. Although TripCo has a 57 voting interest in Tripadvisor, Tripadvisor is a separate public company with a significant non-controlling interest, as TripCo has only a 21 economic interest in Tripadvisor. Even though TripCo controls Tripadvisor through its voting interest and board representation, decision making with respect to using Tripadvisor s cash balances must consider Tripadvisor s minority holders. Accordingly, any potential distributions of cash from Tripadvisor to TripCo would generally be on a pro rata basis based on economic ownership interests. Covenants in Tripadvisor s debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. As of September 30, 2024, 216 million of the Tripadvisor cash and cash equivalents balance were held by foreign subsidiaries, with approximately 36 located in the United Kingdom. As of September 30, 2024, the significant majority of Tripadvisor s cash was denominated in U.S. dollars. As of September 30, 2024, 556 million of Tripadvisor s cumulative undistributed foreign earnings were no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Due to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits in 2017, as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the majority of previously unremitted earnings have been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. To the extent future distributions from these subsidiaries will be taxable, a deferred income tax liability has been accrued on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, which was not material as of September 30, 2024. Credit Facility As of September 30, 2024, Tripadvisor is party to a credit agreement, which, among other things, provides for a 500 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of June 29, 2028 (the Credit Facility ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Tripadvisor had no outstanding borrowings. The Credit Facility, among other things, requires Tripadvisor to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including for a change of control. While there can be no assurance that Tripadvisor will be able to meet the total net leverage ratio covenant, based on its current projections, Tripadvisor does not believe there is a material risk it will not remain in compliance throughout the next twelve months. On July 8, 2024, Tripadvisor amended its Credit Facility, which among other things, provides for a new 500 million term loan B credit facility maturing July 8, 2031, with an interest rate based on the secured overnight financing rate plus 2.75 (the Term Loan B Facility ). The Term Loan B Facility was offered at 99.75 of par and is required to be paid down at 1.00 of the aggregate principal amount per year. As of September 30, 2024, Tripadvisor was in compliance with its debt covenants. Tax Matters The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has been developing its two pillar project to address certain perceived tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy. Many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will result in significant changes to the international taxation system under which our current income tax obligations are determined. Pillar Two of this project calls for a minimum income tax rate on corporations of 15 and has begun to be implemented by an increasing number of countries. The OECD and implementing countries are expected to continue to offer further guidance on the impact of Pillar Two on their respective local corporate income tax rules, however, such impact for Tripadvisor is not expected to be material at this time. Tripadvisor will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact of Pillar Two in the countries in which it operates.

Table of Contents 
 Pillar One, which would reallocate profits from the largest and most profitable businesses to countries where the customers of those businesses are located, remains under discussion at the OECD, and its implementation remains uncertain. If implemented, Pillar One would potentially result in the removal of unilateral digital services tax initiatives, such as those enacted in France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. In July 2023, more than 138 countries and jurisdictions agreed to refrain from imposing newly enacted digital service tax initiatives or similar measures before December 31, 2024, provided the Pillar One negotiations have made sufficient progress by the end of 2023. In December 2023, the OECD Inclusive Framework reaffirmed their commitment to achieve a consensus-based solution and to complete the multilateral agreement by June 2024, thereby extending the standstill on new digital service tax initiatives. The June 2024 extended deadline has since expired, thereby enabling countries to introduce new unilateral digital service taxes. For example, in June 2024, Canada enacted tax legislation related to digital services taxes, which requires retrospective application back to January 1, 2022, resulting in a one-time charge of 4 million during the second quarter of 2024, reflected in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Tripadvisor will continue to monitor these developments to determine the financial impact. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Tripadvisor record ed 7 million and 18 mil lion, respectively, of digital service tax, while during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Tripadvisor recorded 6 million and 13 million, respectively, of digital service tax to general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The projected use of TripCo s corporate cash will primarily be to pay fees to Liberty Media Corporation Liberty Media for providing certain services pursuant to the services agreement and the facilities sharing agreement that TripCo entered into with Liberty Media or certain of its subsidiaries (not expected to exceed approximately 4 million annually), payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock (unless added to the liquidation preference or paid in shares of LTRPA), interest expense on TripCo s 0.50 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2051 (the Debentures (approximately 2 million annually), and to pay any other corporate level expenses. Debt service costs accrue on the VPF borrowing as described in note 5 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. TripCo has several obligations due within the next twelve months. The Series A Preferred Stock is required to be redeemed for cash on March 27, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Redemption Price (as defined in note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) of the Series A Preferred Stock was 266 million. In addition, the Debentures may be redeemed by TripCo, in whole or in part, on or after March 27, 2025. Holders of the Debentures also have the right to require TripCo to purchase their Debentures on March 27, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Debentures was 309 million. If all holders exchanged their Debentures on March 27, 2025 and upon the redemption of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock, TripCo would not have sufficient cash on hand to cover these

 obligations as of September 30, 2024. We note that Tripadvisor has sufficient cash to cover these obligations, but TripCo does not have ready access to Tripadvisor s cash. On February 9, 2024, TripCo s board of directors authorized TripCo to engage in discussions with respect to a potential transaction Potential Transaction ), pursuant to which all of the outstanding stock of TripCo and all of the outstanding common stock and Class B common stock of Tripadvisor, would be acquired concurrently for cash. The board of directors of Tripadvisor has formed a special committee comprised of independent and disinterested directors of the board of directors of Tripadvisor Special Committee ). TripCo and the Special Committee have ceased discussions with third parties with respect to a Potential Transaction. Strategic alternatives with respect to TripCo remain under consideration. In light of current circumstances, management s plans do not alleviate the substantial doubt that the entity will continue as a going concern. Tripadvisor believes that its available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund Tripadvisor s foreseeable working capital requirements, capital expenditures, existing business growth initiatives, debt and interest obligations, lease commitments, tax-related payments and other financial commitments through at least the next twelve months. Tripadvisor s future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions, and/or other expenditures in support of its business strategy, and may potentially reduce Tripadvisor s cash balance and/or require Tripadvisor to borrow under the Credit Facility or to seek other financing alternatives. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities and the conduct of operations by Tripadvisor in different foreign countries. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which include investments in fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We expect to manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We expect to achieve this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates, and (iii) entering into interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate. As of September 30, 2024, our debt is comprised of the following amounts: 

Variable rate debt Fixed rate debt Principal Weighted avg Principal Weighted avg amount interest rate amount interest rate amount in millions Tripadvisor 500 7.6 345 0.3 TripCo debt NA NA 385 1.0 TripCo is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related primarily to the monetary assets and liabilities and the financial results of Tripadvisor s foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the statements of operations are generally translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses, which are reflected in income as unrealized (based on period-end translations) or realized upon settlement of the transactions. Cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the period. Accordingly, TripCo may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with

 respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Tripadvisor enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage its risk related to foreign currency exchange rates when it deems appropriate. Item 4. Controls and Procedures In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its chief executive officer and its principal accounting and financial officer (the "Executives"), of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Executives concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

As disclosed in note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of the required redemption for cash on March 27, 2025 of our 8 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock and the right of the holders of our 0.50 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2051 (the Debentures to require us to purchase their Debentures on March 27, 2025. Although we are exploring alternatives to cover the obligations of the Series A Preferred Stock and Debentures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a transaction or find such an alternative, in which case we would be forced to cease operations. If we ceased operations, it is likely that our investors would lose their investment. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares of LTRPA and LTRPB were surrendered by our officers and employees to pay withholding taxes and other deductions in connection with the vesting or exercise of restricted stock, restricted stock units or options. Item 5. Other Information of the Company s directors or officers or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a trading arrangement during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024.
