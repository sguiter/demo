securities with an unrealized loss at
 September 30, 2024, generally due to increases in market rates. Management evaluates AFS securities in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or non-credit related factors. Consideration is
 given to the extent to which the fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to
 allow for the anticipated recovery in fair value. Management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position as there are adequate liquidity sources to meet expected and unexpected funding needs. The fair value
 of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management believes the unrealized loss positions
 detailed in the previous table are due to non-credit related factors, including changes in interest rates and other market conditions, and therefore no ACL or losses have been recognized or realized in the consolidated financial statements.

 special mention, (iii) substandard, (iv) doubtful, or (v) loss. Loans categorized as loss are charged-off immediately. The grading of loans reflect a judgment by the Company about the risks of default associated with the loan. The Company reviews
 the grades on loans as part of the Company s on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the loan portfolio. These risk ratings are assigned based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to service their debt such as: current
 financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.

Overview

We are a bank holding company headquartered in Lubbock, Texas, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, City Bank is one of the largest independent banks in West Texas and has additional banking operations
 in the Dallas, El Paso, Greater Houston, the Permian Basin, and College Station, Texas markets, and the Ruidoso, New Mexico market. Through City Bank, we provide a wide range of commercial and consumer financial services to small and medium-sized
 businesses and individuals in our market areas. Our principal business activities include commercial and retail banking, along with investment, trust and mortgage services.

Results of Operations

We had net income of 11.2 million, or 0.66 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 13.5 million, or 0.78 per diluted common share for
 the three months ended September 30, 2023. Return on average equity (annualized) was 10.36 and return on average assets (annualized) was 1.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.01 and 1.27 , respectively, for the
 three months ended September 30, 2023.

We had net income of 33.2 million, or 1.96 per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 52.4 million, or 3.01 per diluted common share for the
 nine months ended September 30, 2023. Return on average equity (annualized) was 10.63 and return on average assets (annualized) was 1.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.70 and 1.73 , respectively, for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2023.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the principal source of the Company s net income and represents the difference between interest income (interest and fees earned on assets, primarily loans and investment
 securities) and interest expense (interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds). We generate interest income from interest-earning assets that we own, including loans and investment securities. We incur interest expense from interest-bearing
 liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings, notably FHLB advances and subordinated notes. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (ii) the costs
 of our deposits and other funding sources, (iii) our net interest spread and (iv) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net
 interest margin is calculated as the annualized net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets.

Changes in the market interest rates and interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets,
 interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.

The following tables present, for the periods indicated, information about: (i) weighted average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant
 average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. For
 purposes of this table, interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread are shown on a fully tax-equivalent basis.

Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.3 million, compared to 35.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.6 million, or 4.5 ,
 and was comprised of an increase of 5.1 million in interest income, partially offset by an increase of 3.5 million in interest expense. The growth in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase of 5.3 million in loan interest
 income from growth of 64.2 million in average loans outstanding and an increase of 58 basis points in the yield on loans. The 3.5 million increase in interest expense was primarily related to an increase of 111.2 million in average
 interest-bearing deposits and a 40 basis point increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits over the same period in 2023. Additionally, average noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased 95.1 million for the three months ended
 September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.65 and 2.55 , respectively, compared to 3.52 and 2.48 , respectively, for the same period in 2023,
 which reflects the changes in interest income and interest expense discussed above.

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 108.6 million, compared to 104.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.0 million, or 3.8 ,
 and was comprised of an increase of 24.8 million in interest income, partially offset by an increase of 20.8 million in interest expense. The growth in interest income was attributable to increases of 22.3 million in loan interest income and
 2.4 million in interest income from securities and other interest-earning assets. The increase in loan interest income was mainly due to growth of 162.8 million in average loans outstanding and an increase of 65 basis points in the yield on
 loans. The increase in interest income on securities and other interest-earning assets was primarily due to higher market interest rates. The 20.8 million increase in interest expense was primarily related to an increase of 251.7 million in
 average interest-bearing deposits and an 82 basis point increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits over the same period in 2023. Additionally, average noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased 120.5 million for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.61 and 2.53 , respectively, compared to 3.64 and 2.71 , respectively, for the same period in 2023,
 which reflects the changes in interest income and interest expense discussed above.

Provision for Credit Losses

Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. We establish an allowance for credit losses ACL through charges to earnings, which are shown in the consolidated statements of
 comprehensive income (loss) as the provision for credit losses. Credit losses on loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. The provision for credit losses is determined
 by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of our ACL and charging the shortfall or excess, if any, to the current quarter s expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to our earnings.
 The provision for credit losses and the amount of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management s assessment of the
 quality of the loan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market areas.

The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 495 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a negative provision of 700 thousand for the three months ended
 September 30, 2023. The increase in provision of 1.2 million was largely attributable to a decrease of 1.3 million in specific reserves during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.1 million, compared to 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in
 provision of 900 thousand was largely attributable to a decrease in loan growth, partially offset by an increase in net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

The provision for credit losses is a significant factor in the Company s operating results. For further discussion regarding the provision for credit losses and management s assessment of the adequacy of the ACL
 for loans, see Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans and Asset Quality under Financial Condition in this Item 2, below.

Noninterest Income

While interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues, noninterest income is an important contributing component. The largest portion of our noninterest income is associated
 with our mortgage banking activities. Other sources of noninterest income include service charges on deposit accounts, bank card services and interchange fees, and income from insurance activities.

The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated:

Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.6 million, compared to 12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.6 million, or 13.4 .
 Significant changes in the components of noninterest income are detailed below.

Service charges on deposit accounts - Income from service charges on deposit accounts increased 183 thousand, or 9.9 , for the three months ended September
 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily the result of treasury management initiatives taken to drive growth.

Mortgage banking activities - Income from mortgage banking activities decreased 2.7 million, or 58.9 , to 1.9 million for the
 three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly the result of a decline of 2.7 million in
 the fair value adjustment of the mortgage servicing rights assets as interest rates that affect the value declined in the third quarter of 2024. 

Gain on sale of subsidiary - A 33.5 million gain from the sale of Windmark Insurance Agency, Inc. Windmark was recorded in the second quarter of 2023 and
 an additional 290 thousand was recorded in the third quarter of 2023.

Other income and fees - The Company recognized 700 thousand in property insurance proceeds in the third quarter of 2024.

Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 34.8 million, compared to 70.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 35.3 million, or 50.4 .
 Significant changes in the components of noninterest income are detailed below.

Service charges on deposit accounts - Income from service charges on deposit accounts increased 499 thousand, or 9.4 , for the nine months ended September
 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily the result of treasury management initiatives taken to drive growth.

Mortgage banking activities - Income from mortgage banking activities decreased 2.9 million, or 24.0 , to 9.2 million for the
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly the result of a decline of 1.8 million in
 the fair value adjustment of the mortgage servicing rights assets as interest rates that affect the value declined in the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, mortgage loan originations declined 37.0 million, or 14.1 , in the current year
 period as compared to the prior year period. 

Gain on sale of subsidiary - A 33.8 million gain from the sale of Windmark was recorded in the second and third quarters of 2023.

Income from insurance activities - Due to the sale of Windmark in the second quarter of 2023, there was a decline of 1.4 million in income from insurance
 activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

Other income and fees - The Company recognized 700 thousand in property insurance proceeds in the third quarter of 2024.

 2023 to 57.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by 4.3 million of Windmark transaction and related incentive-based compensation expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2023.

IT and data services - IT and data services increased 598 thousand, or 23.3 , from 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.2 million
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase relates primarily to the Company s cloud migration project.

Loss on sale of securities - The Company sold approximately 56.2 million of available for sale securities in the second quarter of 2023. This resulted in a

Loan Portfolio

Our loans represent the largest portion of earning assets, greater than our securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an
 important consideration when reviewing the Company s financial condition. We originate substantially all of the loans in our portfolio, except certain loan participations that are independently underwritten by the Company prior to purchase.

At September 30, 2024, there was 1.56 billion in adjustable rate loans, with 900.9 million of these loans that mature or reprice in the next twelve months. Of these loans that mature or reprice in
 the next twelve months, 587.6 million will reprice immediately upon changes in the underlying index rate, with the remaining 313.3 million being subject to rate floors above the current index or a future repricing date. The Wall Street Journal prime rate is the predominate index used by the Bank. Further, there is 169.9 million of fixed rate loans that mature in the next twelve months as of September 30, 2024.

The Bank is primarily involved in real estate, commercial, agricultural and consumer lending activities with customers throughout Texas and Eastern New Mexico. We have a collateral concentration, as
 72.8 of our loans were secured by real property as of September 30, 2024, compared to 72.7 as of December 31, 2023. We believe that these loans are not concentrated in any one single property type and that they are geographically dispersed
 throughout the areas we serve. Although the Bank has diversified portfolios, its debtors ability to honor their contracts is substantially dependent upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which it operates, which consist
 primarily of agribusiness, wholesale/retail, oil and gas and related businesses, healthcare industries and institutions of higher education. Commercial real estate loans and residential construction loans represent 40.2 of loans held for
 investment as of September 30, 2024 and represented 40.1 of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2023. Further, 97 of the total dollar amount of these loans are secured by collateral located in the state of Texas.

We have established concentration limits in the loan portfolio for commercial real estate loans and unsecured lending, among other loan types. All loan types are within established limits. We use
 underwriting guidelines to assess the borrowers historical cash flow to determine debt service, and we further stress test the debt service under higher interest rate scenarios. Financial and performance covenants are used in commercial lending
 to allow us to react to a borrower s deteriorating financial condition, should that occur.

Commercial Real Estate . Our commercial real estate portfolio includes loans for commercial property that is owned by real estate investors, construction
 loans to build owner-occupied properties, and loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments. Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to our
 commercial loans. These loans are underwritten primarily based on projected cash flows for income-producing properties and collateral values for non-income-producing properties. The repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the
 successful operation of the property securing the loans or the sale or refinancing of the property. Real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing our real
 estate portfolio are diversified by type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry.

Commercial real estate loans increased 39.4 million, or 3.6 , to 1.12 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 1.08 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase
 in multifamily property loans of 67.1 million and an increase in other commercial real estate loans of 24.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in commercial land development and construction loans of 51.9 million due to the completion of
 several large projects.

Commercial General and Specialized . Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably.
 Underwriting standards have been designed to determine whether the borrower possesses sound business ethics and practices, to evaluate current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed,
 and to ensure appropriate collateral is obtained to secure the loan. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial
 loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as real estate, accounts receivable, or inventory, and typically include personal guarantees. Owner-occupied real estate is included in commercial loans, as the
 repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the operations of the commercial borrower s business rather than on income-producing properties or the sale of the properties. Commercial loans are grouped into two distinct sub-categories:
 specialized and general. Commercial related loans that are considered specialized include agricultural production and real estate loans, energy loans, and finance, investment, and insurance loans. Commercial related loans that contain a broader
 diversity of borrowers, sub-industries, or serviced industries are grouped into the general category. These include goods, services, restaurant retail, construction, and other industries. Performance of these loans is subject to operating
 and cash flow results of the borrower, with risk in the volatility of operating results for particular industries.

Commercial general loans increased 9.1 million, or 1.8 , to 526.4 million as of September 30, 2024 from 517.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial general loans was
 primarily due to increases in loans to companies in the services industry of 16.0 million, partially offset by a decrease of 4.5 million in restaurant and retail loans.

Commercial specialized loans increased 33.9 million, or 9.1 , to 406.3 million as of September 30, 2024 from 372.4 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to growth of
 28.5 million in energy sector loans and 5.6 million in agricultural loans.

Consumer . We utilize a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement our policies and procedures in underwriting consumer loans. Our loan policy
 addresses types of consumer loans that may be originated and the collateral, if secured, which must be perfected. The relatively smaller individual dollar amounts of consumer loans that are spread over numerous individual borrowers also minimize
 our risk. Residential real estate loans are included in consumer loans. We generally require mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance on these residential real estate loans. All consumer loans are generally dependent on the risk
 characteristics of the borrower s ability to repay the loan, a consideration of the debt to income ratio, employment and income stability, the loan-to-value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of the collateral.

Consumer and other loans decreased 32.5 million, or 3.6 , to 881.7 million as of September 30, 2024, from 914.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in these loans was a result of
 declines of 51.8 million in consumer auto loans and 8.4 million in other consumer loans, partially offset by an increase of 27.7 million in residential mortgage loans. As of September 30, 2024, our consumer loan portfolio was comprised of
 562.4 million in 1-4 family residential loans, 253.5 million in auto loans, and 65.8 million in other consumer loans. The consumer auto and other consumer loans portfolios have experienced a decline in new originations due to higher loan rates
 and economic pressures from inflation on consumers.

Construction . Loans for residential construction are for single-family properties to developers, builders, or end-users. These loans are underwritten based
 on estimates of costs and completed value of the project. Funds are advanced based on estimated percentage of completion for the project. Performance of these loans is affected by economic conditions as well as the ability to control costs of the
 projects.

Construction loans decreased 26.7 million, or 20.6 , to 102.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 129.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease resulted from reduced demand for
 residential construction as interest rate levels remained elevated and projects were completed and sold.

37 

Table of Contents 

The commercial real estate and construction categories comprise the Company s nonowner-occupied real estate loans. Total nonowner-occupied real estate loans were 1.22 billion at September 30, 2024
 and 1.21 billion at December 31, 2023. Nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans are made up of income-producing commercial real estate property loans and construction, acquisition, and development property loans. As of September 30, 2024,
 total income-producing commercial real estate property loans totaled 865.9 million and was comprised of 286.6 million of multi-family property loans, 175.1 million of retail property loans, 138.6 million of office property loans, 63.5
 million in hospitality loans, and 202.1 million in other property loans. Other property loans include types such as industrial, warehouse, mini-storage, and convenience stores. As of September 30, 2024, total construction, acquisition, and
 development property loans totaled 357.0 million and was comprised of 102.5 million in residential construction property loans and 254.5 million of commercial construction and other land development loans. The weighted average loan-to-value of
 income-producing nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans was approximately 53 at September 30, 2024. The weighted average loan-to-value of nonowner-occupied office commercial real estate loans was approximately 59 at September 30, 2024.

Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled 335.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 341.1 million at December 31, 2023.

We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to
 extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company s exposure to
 credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to our customers is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments.
 Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the Company until the instrument is exercised. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we
 have in particular classes of financial instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or
 other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company uses the
 same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they do for on-balance sheet instruments. The amount and nature of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on
 management s credit evaluation of the potential borrower.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and
 private short-term borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments for
 which collateral is deemed necessary.

The following table summarizes commitments we have made as of the dates presented.

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans

The ACL provides a reserve against which loan losses are charged for current expected credit losses. Management evaluates the appropriate level of the ACL on a quarterly basis. The analysis takes
 into consideration the results of an ongoing loan review process, the purpose of which is to determine the level of credit risk within the portfolio and to ensure proper adherence to underwriting and documentation standards. Additional allowances
 are provided to those loans which appear to represent a greater than normal exposure to risk. The quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the ACL is assessed by regulatory examinations and the Company s internal and external loan
 reviews. The ACL consists of two elements: (1) specific valuation allowances established for expected losses on specifically analyzed loans and (2) collective valuation allowances calculated using comparable and quantifiable information from both
 internal and external sources about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses are estimated over the
 contractual term of the loans and adjusted for expected prepayments.

38 

Table of Contents 

To determine the adequacy of the ACL on loans, the Company applied a dual credit risk rating DCRR methodology that estimates each loan s
 probability of default and loss given default to calculate the expected credit loss to non-analyzed loans. The DCRR process quantifies the expected credit loss at the loan level for the entire loan portfolio. Loan grades are assigned by a
 customized scorecard that risk rates each loan based on multiple probability of default and loss given default elements to measure the risk of the loan portfolio. The ACL estimate incorporates the Company s DCRR loan level risk rating
 methodology and the expected default rate frequency term structure to derive loan level life of loan estimates of credit losses for every loan in the portfolio. The estimated credit loss for each loan is adjusted based on one-year through the
 cycle estimate of expected credit loss to a life of loan measurement that reflects current conditions and forecasts. The life of loan expected loss is determined using the contractual weighted average life of the loan adjusted for prepayments.
 Prepayment speeds are determined by grouping the loans into pools based on segments and risk rating. After the life of loan expected losses are determined, they are adjusted to reflect the Company s reasonable and supportable economic forecast
 over a selected range of a one to two years. The Company has developed regression models to project net charge-off rates based on macroeconomic variables MEVs ), typically a one-year period is used. MEV s considered in the analysis
 consist of data gathered from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Research Database FRED ), such as, federal funds rate, 10-year treasury rates, 30-year mortgage rates, crude oil prices, consumer price index, housing price index, unemployment rates,
 housing starts, gross domestic product, and disposable personal income. These regression models are applied to the Company s economic forecast to determine the corresponding net charge-off rates. The projected
 net charge-off rates for the given economic scenario are used to adjust the through the cycle expected losses. Qualitative adjustments are also made to ACL results for additional risk factors that are relevant in assessing the expected credit
 losses within our loan segments. These qualitative factor Q-Factor adjustments may increase or decrease management s estimate of the ACL by a calculated percentage based upon the estimated level of risk within a particular segment. Q-Factor
 risk decisions consider concentrations of the loan portfolio, expected changes to the economic forecasts, large relationships, and other factors related to credit administration, such as borrower s risk rating and the potential effect of
 delayed credit score migrations. Management quantifiably identifies segment percentage Q-Factor adjustments using a scorecard risk rating system scaled to historical loss experience within a segment and management s perceived risk for that
 particular segment. In addition to the loan level evaluations, nonaccrual loans with a balance of 250 thousand or more are individually analyzed based on facts and circumstances of the loan to determine if a specific allowance amount may be
 necessary. Specific allowances may also be established for loans whose outstanding balances are below the above threshold when it is determined that the risk associated with the loan differs significantly from the risk factor amounts
 established for its loan category. 

The ACL for loans was 42.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 42.4 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 500 thousand, or 1.3 . The increase is primarily a result of a provision
 for credit losses on loans of 3.1 million being recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 largely attributable to growth of 23.2 million in loans held for investment, partially offset by net charge-offs of 2.6 million during the
 period. Uncertainty regarding forecasted economic conditions remains, due to the continued elevated interest rate environment and persistent inflation in the United States, and additional provisions for credit losses may be necessary in future
 periods.

The following table provides an analysis of the ACL for loans and other data during the periods indicated.

Net charge-offs totaled 887 thousand and were 0.11 (annualized) of average loans outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 362 thousand and 0.05 (annualized) for the three months
 ended September 30, 2023. There was an increase of 315 thousand in net charge-offs on residential construction loans in the third quarter of 2024 due to the charge-off of one loan and an increase in net charge-offs on consumer auto loans of 146
 thousand. Net charge-offs totaled 2.6 million and were 0.11 (annualized) of average loans outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.4 million and 0.06 (annualized) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
 There was an increase of 479 thousand in net charge-offs on commercial-general loans during the first three quarters of 2024 due to the charge-off of several loans under 150 thousand each. There was also an increase of 596 thousand in net
 charge-offs on consumer loans during the first three quarters of 2024. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.41 at September 30, 2024 and 1.41 at December 31, 2023.

While the entire ACL for loans is available to absorb losses from any part of our loan portfolio, the following table sets forth the allocation of the ACL for loans for the periods presented and the

Asset Quality

Loans are considered delinquent when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more. Delinquent loans may remain on accrual status between 30 days and 90 days past due. Loans on which
 the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Typically, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, there is
 a reasonable doubt as to collectability in the normal course of business. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Income on nonaccrual loans
 is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the loan s principal balance is deemed collectible. Loans are restored to accrual status when loans become well-secured and management believes full collectability of
 principal and interest is probable.

40 

Table of Contents 

Loans that exhibit characteristics different from their pool characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective ACL evaluation.
 Income from loans on nonaccrual status is recognized to the extent cash is received and when the loan s principal balance is deemed collectible. Depending on a particular loan s circumstances, we analyze loans for specific allowance based upon
 either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. A
 loan is considered collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is based solely on the liquidation of the collateral. Fair value, where possible, is determined by independent appraisals, typically on an annual basis. Between appraisal periods,
 the fair value may be adjusted based on specific events, such as if deterioration of quality of the collateral comes to our attention as part of our problem loan monitoring process, or if discussions with the borrower lead us to believe the last
 appraised value no longer reflects the actual market for the collateral. The specific allowance amount on a collateral-dependent loan is charged-off to the allowance if deemed not collectible and the impairment amount on a loan that is not
 collateral-dependent is set up as a specific reserve.

Real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned OREO until sold and is initially recorded at fair value less costs to
 sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. OREO and repossessed assets are reported as foreclosed assets.

Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus foreclosed assets.

At September 30, 2024, our total nonaccrual loans were 22.6 million, or 0.74 of total loans held for investment, as compared to 3.2 million, or 0.11 of total loans held for investment, at
 December 31, 2023. These loans within this amount that exceeded 250 thousand were specifically analyzed and specific valuation allowances were established as necessary and included in the ACL for loans as of September 30, 2024 to cover any
 probable loss. The previously disclosed 20.0 million multi-family property credit that was placed on nonaccrual status in the second quarter of 2024 after the maturity date was accelerated, was subsequently modified during the third quarter. The
 modification included more stringent credit metrics. Although the loan remains in nonaccrual status, the loan continues to pay as agreed and is showing improving credit trends. Additionally, two relationships totaling approximately 972 thousand
 that were on nonaccrual at December 31, 2023 were fully repaid in the first quarter of 2024.

Nonperforming loans were 24.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 5.2 million at December 31, 2023. This increase of 19.5 million is mainly due to the changes in nonaccrual loans noted above.

Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extensions, an other than insignificant payment delay, or interest rate
 reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the ACL for loans. Typically, one type of concession, such as term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience
 financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. The Company closely monitors the performance of loans that are modified to
 borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. Upon the Company s determination that a modified loan has subsequently been deemed to not be fully collectible, the uncollectible amount is
 written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the ACL for loans is adjusted by the same amount.

If a borrower on a restructured accruing loan has demonstrated performance under the previous terms, is not experiencing financial difficulty and shows the capacity to continue to perform under the
 restructured terms, the loan will remain on accrual status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, which generally requires six consecutive months of payments.

Securities Portfolio

The securities portfolio is the second largest component of the Company s interest-earning assets, and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to an analysis of the financial
 condition of the Company. The securities portfolio serves the following purposes: (i) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or
 lender; (ii) it provides liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; (iii) it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool, since it provides a large base of assets, the maturity and interest rate
 characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Company; and (iv) it is an alternative interest-earning asset when loan demand is weak or
 when deposits grow more rapidly than loans.

The securities portfolio consists of securities classified as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Securities consist primarily of state and municipal securities, mortgage-backed
 securities and U.S. government sponsored agency securities. We determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase. All held-to-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost, adjusted for premiums and discounts that are
 recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity. All available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value.

Our securities portfolio decreased 15.9 million, or 2.5 , to 606.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 622.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to 28.9 million
 in maturities, prepayments and calls, net of purchases, partially offset by a 15.0 million increase in the fair value of available for sale securities at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023.

41 

Table of Contents 

Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. At September 30, 2024, the unrealized loss on the Company s available for sale securities was
 67.1 million, down from 82.1 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company evaluated whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. Within this evaluation, management considers the extent
 to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. Based on management s evaluation no unrealized losses
 on securities were determined to be due to credit loss. Additionally, we anticipate full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. We do
 not intend to sell these securities and it is not probable that we will be required to sell them before recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity, thus no ACL or losses have been recognized in the Company s consolidated
 financial statements.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our investment securities as of the date presented. Expected maturities may
 differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay an obligation with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Time deposits in amounts of more than 250 thousand represent the type of deposit most likely to affect the Company s future earnings because of interest rate sensitivity. The effective cost of
 these funds is generally higher than other time deposits because the funds are usually obtained at premium rates of interest.

The estimated amount of uninsured deposits as of September 30, 2024 was 1.22 billion. This represented approximately 33 of total deposits and excludes collateralized public fund deposits.

Borrowed Funds

In addition to deposits, we may utilize advances from the FHLB and other borrowings as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations.

FHLB Advances . The FHLB allows us to borrow, both short and long-term, on a blanket floating lien status collateralized by first mortgage loans and
 commercial real estate loans as well as FHLB stock. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total remaining borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 1.11 billion and 1.10 billion, respectively, with no outstanding balance. We had no
 long-term FHLB borrowings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas . The Bank has a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (the FRB ). The amount of the line is determined on a
 monthly basis by the FRB. The line is collateralized by a blanket floating lien on all agriculture, commercial and consumer loans. The amount of the line was 664.2 million and 595.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
 respectively, with no outstanding balance. We had no long-term FRB borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

Lines of Credit . The Bank has uncollateralized lines of credit with multiple banks as a source of funding for liquidity management. The total amount of the
 lines was 140.0 million and 140.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The lines were not used, other than testing during the three and nine months September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months September 30,
 2023.

FHLB Letters of Credit - The Company may use FHLB letters of credit to pledge to certain public deposits. The outstanding balance of FHLB letters of
 credit was 75.0 million and -0- at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Subordinated Debt . In December 2018, the Company issued 14.1 million of subordinated notes that have a maturity date of December 2030 and an average fixed
 rate of 6.41 for the first seven years. After the fixed rate periods, these notes will float at the Wall Street Journal prime rate, with a floor of 4.0 and a ceiling of 7.5 . These notes pay interest
 quarterly, are unsecured, and may be called by the Company at any time after the remaining maturity is five years or less. Additionally, these notes are intended to qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment, subject to regulatory limitations.

On September 29, 2020, the Company issued 50.0 million in subordinated notes. Proceeds were reduced by approximately 926 thousand in debt issuance costs. These notes have a maturity
 date of September 2030 with a fixed rate of 4.50 for the first five years. After the expiration of the fixed rate period, the notes will reset quarterly at a variable rate equal to the then current three-month Secured Overnight
 Financing Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 438 basis points. These notes pay interest semi-annually, are unsecured, and may be called by the Company at any time after the
 remaining maturity is five years or less. Additionally, these notes are intended to qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment, subject to regulatory limitations. 

As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of subordinated debt securities outstanding was 64.1 million less approximately 186 thousand of remaining debt issuance costs for a total balance of
 63.9 million.

Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures and Trust Preferred Securities . Between March 2004 and June 2007, the Company formed three wholly-owned
 statutory business trusts solely for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities, the proceeds of which were invested in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. The trusts are not consolidated and the debentures issued by the
 Company to the trusts are reflected in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records interest expense on the debentures in its consolidated financial statements. The amount of debentures outstanding was 46.4 million at September
 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has the right, as has been exercised in the past, to defer payments of interest on the securities for up to twenty consecutive quarters. During such time, corporate dividends may not be paid. The
 Company is current in its interest payments on the debentures.

The chart below indicates certain information, as of September 30, 2024, about each of the statutory trusts and the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, including the date the junior
 subordinated deferrable interest debentures were issued, outstanding amounts of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, the maturity date of the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, and
 the interest rates on the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs,
 all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the
 daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.

Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in correspondent banks,
 federal funds sold, and fair value of unpledged investment securities. Other available sources of liquidity include wholesale deposits, and additional borrowings from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, and the Federal Reserve discount window. At
 September 30, 2024, the Bank had the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB and Federal Reserve discount window of up to approximately 1.1 billion and 664.2 million, respectively.

Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, and
 increases in customer deposits. Other alternative sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis.

Management believes that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its obligations. However, if general economic conditions, potential recession in the United States and our market areas, the
 impacts related to or resulting from bank failures and any uncertainty in the banking industry, including the associated impact to the Company and other financial institutions of any regulatory changes or other mitigation efforts taken by
 government agencies in response thereto, increased competition for deposits and related changes in deposit customer behavior, changes in market interest rates, the resurgence of elevated levels of inflation or inflationary pressures in the United
 States and our market areas, or other events, cause these sources of external funding to become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds or may incur substantially higher funding costs or operating
 restrictions in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company s operations and growth.

Capital

Total stockholders equity increased to 443.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 407.1 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 36.0 million, or 8.8 . The
 increase from December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of 33.2 million in net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI of 9.3 million, net of tax, partially
 offset by 6.7 million of dividends paid. The increase in AOCI was attributable to the increase in fair value of our available for sale securities and fair value hedges, net of tax, as a result of the decline in market interest rates experienced
 during the period.

We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory
 and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
 (described below), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. The capital amounts and
 classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Qualitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy required us to maintain minimum
 amounts and ratio of common equity tier 1 CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and of tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio.

The risk-based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for
 prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action. In assessing a bank s capital adequacy, regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; quality and level of
 earnings; concentrations of credit, quality of loans and investments; risks of any nontraditional activities; effectiveness of bank policies; and management s overall ability to monitor and control risks.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, both we and the Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which we and the Bank were subject. At September 30, 2024, we and the Bank were well
 capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since September 30, 2024 that would materially adversely change such capital classifications. From time to
 time, we may need to raise additional capital to support our and the Bank s further growth and to maintain our well capitalized status.

The table below summarizes the capital requirements applicable to us and the Bank in order to be considered well capitalized from a regulatory perspective, as well as our and the Bank s capital
 ratios as of the dates indicated.

Community Bank Leverage Ratio

On September 17, 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly finalized a rule to be effective January 1, 2020 and intended to simplify the regulatory capital requirements described above for
 qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR framework, as required by Section 201 of the EGRRCPA. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2020, and the CBLR framework became available
 for banks to use beginning with their March 31, 2020 Call Reports. Under the final rule, if a qualifying community banking organization opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the framework, it will be considered to have met
 the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the prompt corrective action regulations described above and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital. In order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking
 organization must have a tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9 , less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. Although the Company and the Bank are
 qualifying community banking organizations, the Company and the Bank have elected not to opt in to the CBLR framework at this time and will continue to follow the Basel III capital requirements as described above.

Treasury Stock

The Company repurchased stock in accordance with its previously-announced stock repurchase program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30,
 2024, we repurchased 40,000 shares of common stock for a total of 1.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 53,799 share of common stock for a total of 1.3 million. These shares were retired immediately upon
 repurchase by the Company and not included in treasury stock. See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, of this Form 10-Q for further information.

Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk

As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our interest rate risk policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management,
 and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We have historically managed our sensitivity position within our established guidelines.

46 

Table of Contents 

Interest rate sensitivity involves the relationships between rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and is an indication of the probable effects of interest rate fluctuations on the Company s net
 interest income. Interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities are those with yields or rates that are subject to change within a future time period due to maturity or changes in market rates. The model is used to project future net interest
 income under a set of possible interest rate movements. The Company s Investment/Asset Liability Committee ALCO Committee reviews this information to determine compliance with the limits set by the Bank s board of directors.

Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and
 interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net
 interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income.

We manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or
 commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets.

Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the ALCO Committee, in accordance with policies approved by the Bank s board of directors. The ALCO Committee formulates strategies based on
 appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the ALCO Committee considers the impact on earnings and capital on the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates,
 regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The ALCO Committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and
 liabilities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the ALCO Committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity.
 Management employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and an interest rate shock simulation model.

We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analyses to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on
 other financial metrics. Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model. The average lives of non-maturity deposit accounts are based on decay assumptions and are incorporated into the model. All of the
 assumptions used in our analyses are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual
 results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.

On a quarterly basis, we run a simulation model for a static balance sheet and other scenarios. These models test the impact on net interest income from changes in market interest rates under
 various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rates change over a 12-month and 24-month horizon based upon parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous
 parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Non-parallel simulation involves analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. Our internal policy regarding internal
 rate risk simulations currently specifies that for gradual parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 7.5 for a 100 basis point shift, 15 for a
 200 basis point shift, and 22.5 for a 300 basis point shift.

The following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of the dates indicated:

Impact of Inflation

Our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). GAAP
 requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.

47 

Table of Contents 

The Company s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. Management believes the
 impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the Company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and by such reaction, reduce the inflationary impact on performance. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction,
 or at the same magnitude, as the prices of other goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation. Management seeks to manage the relationship between interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in
 order to protect against wide net interest income fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation.

Various information shown elsewhere in this Report will assist in the understanding of how well the Company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends. In particular, additional
 information related to the Company s interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities is contained in this Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Report under the heading Interest
 Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, we also evaluate our performance based on certain additional financial measures
 discussed in this Report as being non-GAAP financial measures. We classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of
 excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the U.S. in our consolidated statements
 of comprehensive income (loss), balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial
 measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both.

The non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in
 accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Report may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. It is important to understand how other
 banking organizations calculate their financial measures with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Report when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.

Tangible Book Value Per Common Share . Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP measure generally used by investors, financial analysts and investment
 bankers to evaluate financial institutions. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible book value per common share is book value per common share. We believe that the tangible book value per common share measure is important
 to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value
 while not increasing our tangible book value.

Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets . Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure generally used by investors, financial analysts
 and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate tangible common equity, as described above, and tangible assets as total assets less goodwill, core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets, net of accumulated
 amortization. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity to tangible assets is total common stockholders equity to total assets. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace
 who are interested in the relative changes from period to period of tangible common equity to tangible assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total
 stockholders equity and assets while not increasing our tangible common equity or tangible assets.

The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets and then presents book value per common
 share, tangible book value per common share, total stockholders equity to total assets, and tangible common equity to tangible assets:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and conform to general practices within the industry in which we operate. To prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
 management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates,
 assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the
 consolidated financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our consolidated financial
 statements.

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have elected
 to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q, as well as any financial statements that we file in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised
 accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as we remain an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act.

The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that we believe require us to make the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.

Securities. Investment securities may be classified into trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale portfolios. Securities that are held principally
 for resale in the near term are classified as trading. Securities that management has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost. Securities not classified as trading or
 held-to-maturity are available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings, but included in the determination of other comprehensive income (loss). Management uses these assets as part of its
 asset/liability management strategy; they may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs, interest rates, resultant prepayment risk changes, and other factors. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time
 of purchase. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Loans. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding
 principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees,
 net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the straight-line method, which is not materially different from the effective interest method required by GAAP.

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management s opinion, collection of interest is unlikely, which typically occurs when principal or interest payments are more than ninety days past
 due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are
 returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

Allowance for Credit Losses. The ACL for loans is established for future expected credit losses through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings.
 Expected losses are calculated using comparable and quantifiable information both internal and external about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the
 collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans and adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the
 uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The Company s ACL for loans consists of specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on specifically analyzed loans
 and collective valuation allowances calculated using comparable and quantifiable information both internal and external about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect
 the collectability of the reported amount.

The ACL for loans is evaluated on a quarterly basis by management and is based upon management s review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of
 the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are
 susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The determination of the adequacy of the ACL for loans is based on estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment and
 market conditions. In connection with the determination of the estimated losses on loans, management obtains independent appraisals for significant collateral. The Bank s loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral including real
 property, crops, livestock, consumer assets, and other business assets.

49 

Table of Contents 

While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, further reductions in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on various factors. In addition, regulatory
 agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses on loans. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the
 time of their examination. Because of these factors, it is reasonably possible that the estimated losses on loans may change materially in the near term. However, the amount of the change that is reasonably possible cannot be estimated.

Loans that exhibit characteristics different from their pool characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective ACL for loans
 evaluation. Certain of these loans are considered to be collateral dependent with the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. For these loans, the fair value of collateral practical expedient is elected whereby the allowance is calculated as
 the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell. All non-accrual loans 250 thousand or greater are analyzed for a specific ACL.

The Company estimates expected credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend
 credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted through provision for credit losses. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will
 occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. Utilization rates are determined based on a two-year rolling average of historical usage. Expected loss rates for all pass rated loans
 are used to determine the ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures.

For AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery
 of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized costs basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS securities that do not meet the aforementioned
 criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the
 rating of the security by rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the
 security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the
 amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the ACL are recorded as provision for credit losses. Losses
 are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Accrued interest is excluded from the estimate of
 credit losses on securities.

Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale are comprised of residential mortgage loans. Loans that are originated for best efforts delivery are carried at the
 lower of aggregate cost or fair value as determined by aggregate outstanding commitments from investors or current investor yield requirements. All other loans held for sale are carried at fair value. Loans sold are typically subject to certain
 indemnification provisions with the investor; management does not believe these provisions will have any significant consequences.

Mortgage Servicing Rights Asset. When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the
 consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) effect recorded in net gain on sale of loans. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model
 that calculates present value of estimated future servicing income.

Under the fair value measurement method, the Company measures servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date and reports change in fair value of servicing assets in earnings in the period in
 which the changes occur, and are included with other noninterest income in the consolidated financial statements. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual
 prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the
 consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances
 exist that indicate that an impairment test should be performed. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

The Company manages market risk, which, as a financial institution is primarily interest rate volatility, through the ALCO Committee of the Bank, in accordance with policies approved by its
 board of directors. The Company uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial
 metrics. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk herein for a discussion of how we manage market risk.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive
 Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
 procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this
 evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
 the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the
 three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Announcement of Designation of Principal Executive Officer

The Company s Board of Directors routinely reviews and considers the roles and responsibilities of the Company s executive officers on an annual basis. As a result of such routine annual
 review, effective November 5, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors determined that it is most appropriate for Mr. Cory T. Newsom, the current President of the Company, to be designated as the principal executive officer of the Company.
 Previously, Mr. Curtis C. Griffith, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, was designated as the principal executive officer of the Company for SEC reporting purposes.

52 

Table of Contents 

Mr. Griffith will continue to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and his role and responsibilities within the organization have not been diminished.

The change in designation of the Company s principal executive officer was approved by the Company s Board of Directors in light of Mr. Newsom s responsibilities and role within the organization
 as President of the Company, as well as the Company s upcoming loss of its status as an emerging growth company on December 31, 2024, which will require additional and more robust executive compensation disclosures of the Company s named
 executive officers. Because Mr. Newsom is currently, and is expected to remain, the highest compensated executive officer of the Company, the designation of Mr. Newsom as the principal executive officer of the Company is also intended to
 provide a more fulsome pay ratio disclosure, as will be required under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K following the Company s upcoming loss of its status as an emerging growth company.

Amendment to Employment Agreement with Curtis C. Griffith.

On November 5, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved an Amendment No. 2 to that certain Employment Agreement, dated
