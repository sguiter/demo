 NOTES

 (Unaudited) 

The
Company s primary sources of revenue are derived from simulator and accessories sales, training and installation, the sale of customizable
software and the sale of extended service-type warranties. The Company s policy is to typically invoice upon completion of installation
and/or training until such a time the performance obligations that have been satisfied are included in unbilled. Sales discounts are
presented in the financial statements as reductions in determining net revenues. Credit sales are recorded as current assets (accounts
receivable and unbilled revenue). Prepaid deposits received at the time of sale and extended warranties purchased are recorded as current
and long-term liabilities (deferred revenue) until earned. The following briefly summarizes the nature of our performance obligations
and method of revenue recognition:

Sales-based

 Recognized
 as the performance obligation is satisfied over time which is as the sales occur. 

The
Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control or upon completion of the services for the simulator and accessories; for the installation
and training and customized software performance obligations as the customer has the right and ability to direct the use of these products
and services and the customer obtains substantially all of the remaining benefit from these products and services at that time. Revenue
from certain customized content contracts may be recognized over the period the services are performed based on the terms of the contract.
For the sales-based royalty exchanged for license of intellectual property, the Company recognized revenue as the sales occur over time. 

The
Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the period of services being rendered for the extended service-type warranties
as these warranties represent a performance obligation to stand ready to perform over the duration of the warranties. As
such, the warranty service is performed continuously over the warranty period. 

Each
contract states the transaction price. The contracts do not include variable consideration, significant financing components or non-cash
consideration. The Company has elected to exclude sales and similar taxes from the measurement of the transaction price. The contract s
transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based upon their stand-alone selling prices. Discounts on the stand-alone
selling prices, if any, are allocated proportionately to each performance obligation.

rentable square feet of office and warehouse space from an unaffiliated third party for our former
corporate office, manufacturing, assembly, warehouse, and shipping facility located at 7970 South Kyrene Road, Tempe, Arizona 85284.
From 2016 through March 2019, the Company leased approximately rentable square feet of office and industrial space from an unaffiliated
third party for our machine shop at 2169 East 5th Street, Tempe, Arizona 85284. In April 2019, the Company relocated the machine shop
from the 5th Street location to 7910 South Kyrene Road, located within the same business complex as our main office. The Company executed
a lease amendment to add an additional rentable square feet for the machine shop and extended its existing office lease through
April 2024. On June 1, 2022, we entered a new lease of approximately square feet located at 12301 Challenger Parkway, Orlando,
Florida, from an unaffiliated third party through May 2027. 

The
Company s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants, or variable lease payments. The
Company has not entered into any financing leases. 

In
addition to base rent, the Company s lease generally provides for additional payments for other charges, such as rental tax. The
lease includes fixed rent escalations. The Company s lease does not include an option to renew. 

The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are recorded in operating lease right of use assets, net,
operating lease liability short-term, and operating lease liability long-term on its balance sheets. 

Operating
lease assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation
to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on
the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company s lease does not provide an implicit rate, the Company
uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease
payments. The incremental borrowing rate used at adoption was 4.5 . Significant judgement is required when determining the Company s
incremental borrowing rate. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Effective
June 1, 2022, the Company obtained a right-of-use asset in exchange for a new operating lease liability in the amount of . Effective
January 1, 2019, the Company obtained a right-of-use asset in exchange for a new operating lease liability in the amount of

Business
Overview 

VirTra,
Inc. (the Company, VirTra, we, us and our is a global provider
of judgmental use of force training simulator and firearms training simulators for the law enforcement, military, educational and commercial
markets. The Company s patented technologies, software, and scenarios provide intense training for de-escalation, judgmental use-of-force,
marksmanship, and related training that mimics real-world situations. VirTra s mission is to save and improve lives worldwide through
practical and highly effective virtual reality and simulator technology. 

The
VirTra firearms training simulator allows marksmanship and realistic scenario-based training to take place daily without the need for
a shooting range, protective equipment, role players, safety officers, or a scenario-based training site. We have developed a higher
standard in simulation training including capabilities such as: multi-screen, video-based scenarios, unique scenario authoring ability,
superior training scenarios, the patented Threat-Fire shoot-back system, powerful gas-powered simulated recoil weapons, and more.
The simulator also allows students to receive immediate feedback from the instructor without the potential for sustaining injuries by
the instructor or the students. The instructor can teach and re-mediate critical issues, while placing realistic stress on the students
due to the realism and safe training environment created by the VirTra simulator. 

Business
Strategy 

We
have two main customer groups, namely, law enforcement and military. These are quite different markets and require different sales and
marketing programs as well as personnel. Our focus is to expand the market share and scope of our training simulators sales to these
identified customer groups by pursuing the following key growth strategies: 

3 

Build
 Our Core Business . Our goal is to profitably grow our market share by continuing to develop, produce and market the most
 effective simulators possible. Through disciplined growth in our business, we have achieved a solid balance sheet by increasing our
 working capital and limiting our bank debt. We plan to add staff to our experienced management team as needed to meet the expected
 increase in demand for our products and services as we increase our marketing and sales activities. 

Increase
 Total Addressable Market . We plan to increase the size of our total addressable market. This effort will focus on new marketing
 and new product and/or service offerings for the purpose of widening the number of types of customers who might consider our products
 or services uniquely compelling. 

Broaden
 Product Offerings . Since its formation in 1993, our company has had a proud tradition of innovation in the field of simulation
 and virtual reality. We plan to release revolutionary new products and services as well as continue incremental improvements to existing
 product lines. In some cases, the company may enter a new market segment via the introduction of a new type of product or service. 

Partners
 and Acquisitions. We try to spend our time and funds wisely and not tackle tasks that can be done more efficiently with partners.
 For example, international distribution is often best accomplished through a local distributor or agent. We are also open to the
 potential of acquiring additional businesses or of being acquired ourselves, based on what is expected to be optimal for our long-term
 future and our stockholders. 

Product
Offerings 

Our
simulator products include the following: 

V-300

Results
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 

Revenues.
 Net sales were 7,484,269 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7,561,582 for the same period in 2023,
a decrease of 77,313 or 1 . Net sales were 21,653,707 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27,925,420 for the
same period in 2023, a decrease of 6,271,713, or 22 . The decrease in revenue can be attributed to the smaller amount of bookings in
the prior 3 quarters due to the temporary funding measures taken by the federal government that delayed many of our contracts as
well as the time it takes for the rebuilding of our sales team. 

Cost
of Sales. Cost of sales were 1,986,296 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,175,508 for the same
period in 2023, a decrease of 189,212, or 9 . Cost of sales were 5,168,978 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 9,669,708, or a 47 decrease. The dollar decrease for the three-month ending period correlates with the lower revenues for the
current quarter compared to last year which equates to lower COGS. In addition, 31 of our 3-month ending September 30, 2024 revenue
is derived from STEP and Service contracts that have limited COGS. For the nine-month ending lower dollars and percentage is related
to a reclassification of COGS labor related to our development projects. This expense will be reflected in the income statement when
we have the corresponding matching revenue. 

5 

Gross
Profit. Gross profit was 5,497,973 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5,386,074 for the same period
in 2023, an increase of 111,899, or 2 . Gross profit was 16,484,729 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18,255,712
for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1,770,983, or 10 . The gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
and 2023 was 73 and 71 , respectively. The gross profit margin was 76 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 65 for the
same period in 2023. This is solely driven by the decrease in Cost of Sales as stated above. 

Operating
Expenses. Net operating expense was 4,742,341 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,716,463 for the
same period in 2023, an increase of 1,025,878, or 28 . Net operating expense was 13,199,337 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to 11,186,189 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2,013,148, or 18 . This increase for both the 3 month
and 9 month ending periods come from payroll and benefits as labor rates increase and as we bring on higher level staff to help
build infrastructure for the future. Along with the additional taxes associated with the RSU payments for both the Chairman of the
board as well as the CEO in the third quarter. a major factor this year has been and increase in IT expenses to help prepare the
organization for regulatory compliance. Travel expenses increased year-over-year as we seek to expand our footprint in our
sales territories including the international market which requires additional travel.

Adjusted
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Explanation and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 

Earnings
before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and before other non-operating costs and income EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA also includes non-cash stock option expense. Other companies may calculate
adjusted EBITDA differently. The Company calculates its adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items it does not consider
to be indicative of its performance and its ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is presented herein because management believes the presentation
of adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to the Company s investors regarding the Company s financial condition and
results of operations and because adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in
the evaluation of companies in the Company s industry, several of which present EBITDA and a form of adjusted EBITDA when reporting
their results. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of the Company s results as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ).
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative for net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities and other income
or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. A reconciliation of net loss
to adjusted EBITDA is provided in the following table:

Liquidity
and Capital Resources. Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash
requirements. The Company had 19,668,455 and 18,849,842 of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023,
respectively. Working capital was 35,984,477 and 33,240,516 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Net
cash provided by operating activities was 2,669,269 and 4,365,751 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
Net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from for the change in contract terms to collect deposits and the decrease
in AR as we have improved collection efforts. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 1,692,249 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing
activities of 512,249 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investing activities in 2024 and 2023 consisted of purchases of
property and equipment, specifically the new equipment in the machine shop. 

Net
cash used in financing activities was 158,408 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 93,194 used in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. In both periods, cash was used primarily for principal payment of debt offset by the proceeds from the issuance
of RSUs. 

Bookings
and Backlog 

The
Company defines bookings as the total of newly signed contracts, awarded RFP s and purchase orders received in a defined time
period. The Company received bookings totaling 8.9 million in the three months ending September 30, 2024 and 17.7 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company defines backlog as the accumulation of bookings that have not started or are
uncompleted performance objectives and cannot be recognized as revenue until delivered in a future quarter. Backlog also includes
extended warranty agreements and STEP agreements that are deferred revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of each
respective agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s backlog was 15.2 million. The breakout of this backlog includes
 7 million in capital, 6.2 million in service and warranties, and 2 million in STEP contracts. Warranties/Service and STEP backlog
calculated in this number is revenue that will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the next 7 years. In addition, there is
an estimated potential of 5.8 million in renewable STEP contracts over the next 5 years. A note to the renewable STEP number
as it will begin to come down as we are only writing 3-year agreements and any additional years with be subject to new negotiations
we will no longer report the full 5 years as potentially renewable. This is no way an indication that those contracts would not
extend past the three years we are only being cautious with our estimates. Management estimates the majority of the new capital
bookings received in the first nine months of 2024 will be converted to revenue in 2024. Management estimates the conversion of
backlog based on current contract delivery dates; however, contract terms and dates are subject to modification and are
routinely changed at the request of the customer.

Cash
Requirements 

Our
management believes that our current capital resources will be adequate to continue operating the company and maintaining our current
business strategy for more than 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report. We are, however, open to raising additional funds
from the capital markets, at a fair valuation, to expand our product and services offered, to enhance our sales and marketing efforts
and effectiveness, and to aggressively take advantage of market opportunities. There can be no assurance, however, that additional financing
will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to
obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to scale down our plans for expanded marketing
and sales efforts. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our unaudited financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are
otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Significant accounting estimates in these financial statements include valuation
assumptions for share-based payments, allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable, inventory reserves, accrual for warranty
reserves, the carrying value of long-lived assets, income tax valuation allowances, the carrying value of cost basis investments, and
the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in our contracts with customers. We base our estimates on historical
experience, our observance of trends in particular areas, and information or valuations and various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts could differ significantly from amounts previously estimated. For
a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Part I, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management believes
that there have been no changes in our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 1 to our financial statements, included in Part I, Item 1., Financial Information of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to investors. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction,
agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising
under a guaranteed contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to
such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant
to the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, evaluated our company s
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to material weaknesses, which we
identified in our report on internal control over financial reporting contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Change
in internal control over financial reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024,
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, during
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and continuing into 2025, we are implementing more formal review and documentation of workflow
processes and increased our ERP training for our staff. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot
provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected. 

PART
II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

There
is no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which we are a party
or of which any of our property is the subject.
