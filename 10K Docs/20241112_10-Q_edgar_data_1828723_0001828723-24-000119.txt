 and VIEs, respectively. 
 As discussed in Note 5, on July 3, 2024 and September 10, 2024, the Company acquired all outstanding equity interests in three entities that were deemed to be VIEs due to insufficient amounts of at-risk equity to finance activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is the primary beneficiary through its ownership interests, as the Company has the power to direct the operating activities of the VIEs and is exposed to economics that could potentially be significant to the entities. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company made additional investments in two of the acquired VIEs and the at-risk equity in these entities became sufficient to finance their operations. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, these entities were consolidated under the voting interest entity model.

 Alignment Shares Liability 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had Alignment Shares outstanding, all of which are held by CBRE Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (the " Sponsor "), certain former officers of CBAH and former CBAH directors. The Alignment Shares will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock based upon the Total Return (as defined in Exhibit 4.4 to our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K) on the Class A common stock as of the relevant measurement date over each of the seven fiscal years following the Merger. 
 Upon the consummation of the Merger, Alignment Shares have no continuing service requirement and do not create an unconditional obligation requiring the Company to redeem the instruments by transferring assets. In addition, the shares convert to a variable number of Class A common stock depending on the trading price of the Class A common stock and dividends paid/payable to the holders of Class A common stock. Therefore, the shares do not represent an obligation or a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares with a monetary value based on any of the criteria in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity. The Company determined that the Alignment Shares meet the definition of a derivative because they contain (i) an underlying (Class A common stock price), (ii) a notional amount (a fixed number of Class B common stock), (iii) no or minimal initial net investment (the Sponsor paid a de minimis amount which is less than the estimated fair value of the shares), and (iv) net settleable through a conversion of the Alignment Shares into Class A shares. As such, the Company concluded that the Alignment Shares meet the definition of a derivative, which will be presented at fair value each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. 
 The Company estimates the fair value of outstanding Alignment Shares using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model utilizing a distribution of potential outcomes based on a set of underlying assumptions such as stock price, volatility, and risk-free interest rate. As volatility of and risk-free interest rate of are not observable inputs, the overall fair value measurement of Alignment Shares is classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs can be volatile and a change in those inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement of Alignment Shares.

 million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in fair value of interest rate swaps resulted in a loss of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in fair value of interest rate swaps resulted in a gain of million and million, respectively. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps is recorded as interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations . 
 Forward Starting Interest Rate Swap 
 The Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap on January 31, 2023, with an effective date of January 31, 2025, and a termination date of January 31, 2035. This transaction had a notional amount of million and was designated as a cash flow hedge of the Company's forecasted fixed-rate or floating-rate debt issuances. 
 Later in 2023, the Company terminated the forward starting interest rate swap for total cash proceeds of million. The total gain of million was recorded as a component of Other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company allocated million of the notional amount to the incremental debt issuances under the APAF III Term Loan and million to the APAF IV Term Loan. 
 Other comprehensive income of million associated with the incremental debt issuances under the APAF III Term Loan and APAF IV Term Loan is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over the term of the debt. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the adjustment to Interest expense, net was million and million, respectively. Approximately million of the gain in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. 
 The cash flow hedge was determined to be fully effective during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As such, no amount of ineffectiveness has been included in net income. The amount included in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to current earnings should all or a portion of the hedge no longer be considered effective. The Company expects the hedge to remain fully effective during the remaining term of the swap. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 Caldera Acquisition 
 In connection with the Caldera Acquisition on December 20, 2023, contingent consideration of million may be payable upon achieving certain power volumes generated by the acquired solar energy facilities. The Company estimated the fair value of contingent consideration for future earnout payments using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Significant assumptions used in the measurement include the estimated volumes of power generation of acquired solar energy facilities during the 12-month period since the acquisition date and the risk-adjusted discount rate associated with the business. As the inputs are not observable, the overall fair value measurement of the contingent consideration is classified as Level 3. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the contingent consideration was and million, respectively, and is included in other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration by using the expected cash flow approach. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using the risk-adjusted discount rate associated with the business. As the inputs are not observable, the overall fair value measurement of the contingent consideration is classified as Level 3. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the contingent consideration was million and million, respectively, and was included in other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded loss of and million, respectively, on fair value remeasurement of

The Company recognized million and million of stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted units, respectively, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately years. 
 Legacy Incentive Plans 
 Prior to the Merger, Legacy Altus maintained the APAM Holdings LLC Restricted Units Plan, adopted in 2015 (the APAM Plan and APAM Holdings LLC adopted the 2021 Profits Interest Incentive Plan (the Holdings Plan , and together with the APAM Plan, the Legacy Incentive Plans ), which provided for the grant of restricted units that were intended to qualify as profits interests to employees, officers, directors and consultants. In connection with the Merger, vested restricted units previously granted under the Legacy Incentive Plans were exchanged for shares of Class A Common Stock, and unvested Altus Restricted Shares under each of the Legacy Incentive Plans were exchanged for restricted Class A Common Stock with the same vesting conditions. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and shares of Class A Common Stock were restricted under the Holdings Plan, respectively. No further awards will be made under the Legacy Incentive Plans. 
 The fair value of the granted units was determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model and relied on assumptions and inputs provided by the Company. All option models utilize the same assumptions with regard to (i) current valuation, (ii) volatility, (iii) risk-free interest rate, and (iv) time to maturity. The models, however, use different assumptions with regard to the strike price which vary by award.

Subject to continued employment on each applicable vesting date, the time-based RSUs generally vest 33 1/3 on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Closing, and the performance-based RSUs vest with respect to 33 1/3 of the award upon the achievement of the above time-based requirement and the achievement of a hurdle representing a annual compound annual growth rate measured based on an initial value of per share (i.e., on each of the third anniversary, the fourth anniversary, and the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the stock price performance hurdle shall be , , , respectively), which vesting is eligible until the fifth anniversary of grant date. 
 On March 28, 2024 , the vesting conditions of such performance-based RSUs were modified by the compensation committee to set the hurdles at , , and , respectively. This modification impacted grantees and resulted in million of incremental expense. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized expense related to the modification was million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of years. 
 Additionally, under the Incentive Plan the Company granted performance stock units (" PSUs ") that are subject to market and service vesting conditions, each of which represents the right to receive share of the Company's Class A Common Stock and which vest in installment on the third anniversary of the grant date based upon the Company's total stockholder return when compared to the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), subject to certain adjustments, and the Russell 2000 index, assigning a weight of to each. The number of PSUs vested, and thus shares of Class A Common Stock issued, could range from to of such PSUs.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted and RSUs, respectively, and recognized million and million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense in relation to the Incentive Plan. For th e three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and RSUs were forfeited, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and R SUs were forfeited, respectively. 
 Included in forfeited RSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are the unvested RSUs and PSUs granted under the Incentive Plan to Mr. Norell, which were forfeited in connection with the CEO transition described in Note 12, "Related Party Transactions." This forfeiture resulted in the reversal of million of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 On December 9, 2021, we adopted the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" ESPP "), which provides a means by which eligible employees may be given an opportunity to purchase shares of the Company s Class A common stock. As of both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , there were shares of the Company's Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the ESPP will increase on January 1 of each year from 2024 to 2031 by the lesser of (i) of the number of shares outstanding as of the close of business on the immediately preceding December 31 and (ii) the number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors. shares of the Company s Class A common stock were issued and stock-based compensation expense was recognized in relation to the ESPP fo r the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the ESPP increased by of outstanding shares as described in the foregoing on January 1, 2022 and January 1, 2023.

 million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had income tax benefit of million and income tax expense of million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the fair value remeasurement of Alignment Shares, nondeductible compensation, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, and state income taxes. Additionally, there was an income tax benefit resulting from the forfeiture of stock awards associated with the CEO transition. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the fair value remeasurement of Alignment Shares, nondeductible compensation, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, state income taxes, and other miscellaneous items. 
 million, however, the ITCs have not been transferred as of September 30, 2024, and as such, the Company recognized a liability to transfer ITCs within other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Transfer of ITCs did not have a material impact on the Company's income tax benefit recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company did not enter into any TCPAs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Overview 
 We are a developer, owner and operator of large-scale roof, ground and carport-based photovoltaic PV and energy storage systems serving commercial and industrial, public sector and community solar customers. Our mission is to create a clean electrification ecosystem and drive the clean energy transition of our customers across the United States while simultaneously enabling the adoption of corporate environmental, social and governance ESG targets. In order to achieve our mission, we develop, own and operate a network of solar generation and energy storage facilities. We believe we have the in-house expertise to develop, build and provide operations and maintenance and customer servicing for our assets. The strength of our platform is enabled by premier sponsorship from The Blackstone Group Blackstone ), which provides an efficient capital source and access to a network of portfolio companies, and CBRE Group, Inc. CBRE ), which provides direct access to its portfolio of owned and managed commercial and industrial C I properties. 
 
 We own systems across the United States from Hawaii to Maine. Our portfolio currently consists of over 1 gigawatt GW of solar PV. We have long-term power purchase agreements PPAs with over 450 enterprise entities and contracts with approximately 30,000 residential customers which are serviced by over 300 megawatts (" MW ") of community solar projects currently in operation. Our community solar projects are currently serving customers in 9 states. We also participate in numerous renewable energy credit REC programs throughout the country. We have experienced significant growth in the last fiscal year as a product of organic growth and targeted acquisitions and operate in 25 states, providing clean electricity to our customers equal to the electricity consumption of over 100,000 homes, displacing over 800,000 tons of CO2 emissions per annum. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 37 

Our results of operations and our ability to grow our business over time could be impacted by a number of factors and trends that affect our industry generally, as well as new offerings of services and products we may acquire or seek to acquire in the future. Additionally, our business is concentrated in certain markets, putting us at risk of region-specific disruptions such as adverse economic, regulatory, political, weather and other conditions. See Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of risks affecting our business. We believe the factors discussed below are key to our success: 
 Competition 
 We compete in the C I scale renewable energy space with utilities, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for new investment opportunities. We expect to grow our market share because of the following competitive strengths: 
 Development Capability: We have established an innovative approach to the development process. From site identification and customer origination through the construction phase, we ve established a streamlined process enabling us to further create the scalability of our platform and significantly reduce the costs and time in the development process. Part of our attractiveness to our customers is our ability to ensure a high level of execution certainty. We anticipate that this ability to originate, source, develop and finance projects will ensure we can continue to grow and meet the needs of our customers. 
 Long-term Revenue Contracts: Our C I solar generation contracts have a typical length of 20 years or longer, creating long-term relationships with customers that allow us to cross-sell additional current and future products and services. The average remaining life of our current contracts is approximately 15 years. These long-term contracts are either structured at a fixed rate, often with an escalator, or floating rate pegged at a discount to the prevailing local utility rates. We refer to these latter contracts as variable rate, and as of September 30, 2024, these variable rate contracts make up approximately 54 of our current installed portfolio. Contracts with a fixed rate and a fixed rate with an escalator make up approximately 28 and 18 of our current installed portfolio, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall utility rates generally increased in states where we have projects under variable rate contracts, but there can be no guarantee that they will continue to do so. The realization of solar power price increases varies depending on region, utility and terms of revenue contract, but generally, we would benefit from such increases in the future as inflationary pressures persist. 
 Flexible Financing Solutions: We have a market-leading cost of capital in an investment-grade rated scalable credit facility from Blackstone, which enables us to be competitive bidders in asset acquisition and development. In addition to our Blackstone term loan, we also have financing available through a revolving credit facility which has 200 million of committed capacity with 5-year maturity and interest of SOFR plus spread between 160 - 260 basis points on drawn balances, a construction facility which has 200 million of committed capacity with a 5-year maturity and interest of SOFR plus 350 basis points on drawn balances, and a term loan which has 100 million of additional committed capacity with a 6-year maturity and an initial fixed interest rate of 8.50 , subject to adjustments. 
 Leadership: We have a strong executive leadership team who has extensive experience in capital markets, solar development and solar construction, with over 20 years of experience each. Moreover, through the transaction structure, management and employees will continue to own a significant interest in the Company. 
 CBRE Partnership : Our partnership with CBRE, the largest global real estate services company, provides us with a clear path to creating new customer relationships. Ninety percent (90 of the Fortune 100 are CBRE clients, providing a significant opportunity for us to expand our customer base. 
 Seasonality 
 The amount of electricity our solar energy systems produce is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. Because shorter daylight hours in winter months and poor weather conditions due to rain or snow results in less irradiation, the output of solar energy systems will vary depending on the season and the overall weather conditions in a year. Historically, sales of energy generated from our solar energy systems have contributed on average approximately 18 to 20 of our annual revenues during the first quarter, 25 to 29 during the second quarter, 29 to 31 during the third quarter, and 22 to 26 during the fourth quarter. While we expect seasonal variability to occur, the geographic diversity in our assets helps to mitigate our aggregate seasonal variability. 
 Another aspect of seasonality relates to our construction program, which is more productive during warmer weather months and generally results in project completion during fourth quarter. This is particularly relevant for our projects under construction in colder climates like the Northeast. 
 38 

Pipeline 
 As of September 30, 2024, our pipeline of opportunities totaled over one gigawatt and is comprised of a mix of (i) development projects for solar generating and storage projects that are not yet built, which primarily consist of those we are looking to acquire from the current owner of such project and (ii) existing solar generating and storage projects currently in operation that we are looking to acquire from the current owner of the facilities. As an independent solar power producer, we are not regularly engaged in our own early stage development of solar generating and storage projects and generally prefer to source opportunities from our early stage channel partners, viewing those as a more productive and efficient way to grow our business. 
 Our pipeline is dynamic with new opportunities being evaluated by our team each quarter as possible candidates to be included in the pipeline. Also, during the quarter, we evaluate our existing pipeline opportunities and may determine that certain pipeline opportunities no longer meeting our needs. Upon such a determination, those pipeline opportunities would then be excluded from the pipeline. As a result, our pipeline changes regularly and is very fluid. Given the number of potential pipeline opportunities and the confidential nature of such opportunities, we do not identify these opportunities specifically and thus it is difficult to show when a project might have been added or removed from our pipeline and at what phase. 
 As discussed in the table below, there are five types of pipeline opportunities for which we ve identified both the number of megawatts subject to such opportunities and the probability of their completion: 
 Type of Pipeline Opportunity and Phase Size, MW Probability of completion Development projects Development solar generating and storage projects - in construction or pre-construction phase (not yet built) 162 High Development solar generating or storage projects - in contract / in negotiation phase (not yet built) 258 Medium Operating acquisitions Acquisitions of operating solar generating and storage projects - in closing phase (existing projects) 8 High Acquisitions of operating solar generating and storage projects - in negotiation (existing projects) 218 Medium Development projects and operating acquisitions Development projects and operating acquisitions - initial engagement phase Remaining projects Low Total pipeline of opportunities > 1,000 
 We consider development solar generating and storage projects that are currently in construction or pre-construction primarily as those projects developed by other parties, such as our channel partners, that we may acquire. 
 We classify development projects in the in construction phase as having commenced construction but the project is not yet operational. In the case of pre-construction projects, the execution of definitive documents to acquire development rights may not have occurred or the projects are waiting for the satisfaction of one or more critical components to become in-construction, such as submission and approval of an interconnection application, site control, awarded revenue contract, final permits, etc. 
 We consider development projects that are in the in contract / in negotiation phase to include projects where we are currently negotiating commercial terms with clients or channel partners and working toward the signing of documents such as a letter of intent, lease, or power purchase agreement. 
 We consider acquisitions of operating solar generating and storage projects in the in closing phase to include deals where we have entered exclusivity agreements with the seller and/or have agreed upon terms and are working toward the execution of definitive purchase agreements. 
 We consider acquisitions of operating solar generating and storage projects that are in the in negotiation phase to include deals where we do not have exclusivity agreements in place, but have completed our initial valuation of the projects, determined it meets our needs and are working to negotiate and agree upon commercial terms with the seller. 
 39 

The remainder of our pipeline of development projects and operating acquisitions are in the initial engagement phase. In both cases, we are in the early stage of sourcing the opportunity and we are actively evaluating and have not yet determined whether they meet our needs or if we can agree on satisfactory terms and, as such, these early stage projects should not be relied upon in the making of investment decisions as there is no certainty that such early stage projects will be consummated in the next twelve months, if at all. Please refer to the Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Key Financial and Operational Metrics 
 We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key operational and financial metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance and liquidity, identify trends affecting our business, formulate our financial projections and make strategic decisions. 
 Megawatts Installed 
 Megawatts installed represents the aggregate megawatt nameplate capacity of solar energy systems for which panels, inverters, and mounting and racking hardware have been installed on premises. 
 As of September 30, 
 Change 2024 2023 MW Megawatts installed 
 1,013 721 292 40 
 Cumulative megawatts installed increased from 721 MW as of September 30, 2023, to 1,013 MW as of September 30, 2024, a 40 increase. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 
 As of December 31, 2023 
 Change MW Megawatts installed 
 1,013 896 117 13 
 Cumulative megawatts installed increased from 896 MW as of December 31, 2023, to 1,013 MW as of September 30, 2024, a 13 increase. 
 
 The following table provides an overview of megawatts installed by state as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 State Megawatts installed Share, percentage New York 205 20.2 New Jersey 185 18.3 Massachusetts 150 14.8 California 120 11.9 North Carolina 67 6.6 Minnesota 60 5.9 South Carolina 42 4.1 Hawaii 34 3.4 Maine 33 3.2 All other 117 11.6 Total 1,013 100.0 
 
 Capacity Factor means the amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that same time period (e.g., in the case of solar energy, if the sun was shining brightly 24 hours a day, seven days a week). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the capacity factor of our solar generating facilities ranged from 9.1 to 26.9 across each of the states in which we operate and the weighted average capacity across our entire portfolio was 14.6 . The size of our portfolio is approximately 1 GW with the average size of solar facilities of 2 MW, and these facilities are located across 25 different states in our portfolio. Given this, we 
 40 

do not view the Capacity Factor of any one of our solar generating facilities, or the change in that Capacity Factor due to weather, seasonality or other factors, to be material to our operating revenues. 
 
 Megawatt Hours Generated 
 Megawatt hours MWh generated represents the output of solar energy systems from operating solar energy systems. MWh generated relative to nameplate capacity can vary depending on multiple factors such as design, equipment, location, weather and overall system performance. Megawatt hours generated excludes the output of solar energy systems under the master lease agreement with Vitol, as described in Note 5, "Acquisitions," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Three months ended September 30, 
 Change 2024 2023 MWh Megawatt hours generated 
 333,000 239,000 94,000 39 
 
 Megawatt hours generated increased from 239,000 MWh for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 333,000 MWh for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 39 increase. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 
 Change 2024 2023 MWh Megawatt hours generated 
 874,000 638,000 236,000 37 
 
 Megawatt hours generated increased from 638,000 MWh for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 874,000 MWh for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 37 increase. 
 Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, income tax expense or benefit, acquisition and entity formation costs, stock-based compensation expense or benefit, and excluding the effect of certain non-recurring items we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance such as, but not limited to, gain or loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration, gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, change in fair value of Alignment Shares liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, CEO transition costs (see Note 12, "Related Party Transactions," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for further details), and other miscellaneous items of other income and expenses. 
 We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we use to measure our performance. We believe that investors and analysts also use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in evaluating our operating performance. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. The U.S. GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net income and to adjusted EBITDA margin is net income over operating revenues. The presentation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed to suggest that our future results will be unaffected by non-cash or non-recurring items. In addition, our calculation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are not necessarily comparable to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as calculated by other companies and investors and analysts should read carefully the components of our calculations of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to management, investors and analysts in providing a measure of core financial performance adjusted to allow for comparisons of results of operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Factors in this determination include the exclusion of (1) variability due to gains or losses related to fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration and the change in fair value of Alignment Shares liability, (2) strategic decisions to acquire businesses, dispose of property, plant and equipment or extinguish debt, and (3) the non-recurring nature of stock-based compensation, CEO transition costs, and other miscellaneous items of income and expense, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, adjusted EBITDA represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, as well as interest expense and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, which are not representative of our ongoing operating performance. 
 41 

Adjusted EBITDA is also used by our management for internal planning purposes, including our consolidated operating budget, and by our board of directors in setting performance-based compensation targets. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to but viewed in conjunction with U.S. GAAP results, as we believe it provides a more complete understanding of ongoing business performance and trends than U.S. GAAP measures alone. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 The Company derives its operating revenues principally from PPAs, net metering credit agreements NMCAs ), solar renewable energy credits SRECs ), and performance based incentives. 
 Power sales under PPAs . A portion of the Company s power sales revenues is earned through the sale of energy (based on kilowatt hours) pursuant to the terms of PPAs. The Company s PPAs typically have fixed or floating rates and are generally invoiced monthly. The Company applied the practical expedient allowing the Company to recognize revenue in the amount that the Company has a right to invoice which is equal to the volume of energy delivered multiplied by the applicable contract rate. As of September 30, 2024, PPAs have a weighted-average remaining life of 11 years. 
 Power sales under net metering credit agreements . A portion of the Company s power sales revenues are obtained through the sale of net metering credits under NMCAs. Net metering credits are awarded to the Company by the local utility based on kilowatt hour generation by solar energy facilities, and the amount of each credit is determined by the utility s applicable tariff. The Company currently receives net metering credits from various utilities including Eversource Energy, National Grid Plc, and Xcel Energy. There are no direct costs associated with net metering credits, and therefore, they do not receive an allocation of costs upon generation. Once awarded, these credits are then sold to third party offtakers pursuant to the terms of the offtaker agreements. The Company views each net metering credit in these arrangements as a distinct performance obligation satisfied at a point in time. Generally, the customer obtains control of net metering credits at the point in time when 
 42 

the utility assigns the generated credits to the Company account, who directs the utility to allocate to the customer based upon a schedule. The transfer of credits by the Company to the customer can be up to one month after the underlying power is generated. As a result, revenue related to NMCA is recognized upon delivery of net metering credits by the Company to the customer. As of September 30, 2024, NMCAs have a weighted-average remaining life of 19 years. 
 SREC revenue . The Company applies for and receives SRECs in certain jurisdictions for power generated by solar energy systems it owns. The quantity of SRECs is based on the amount of energy produced by the Company s qualifying generation facilities. SRECs are sold pursuant to agreements with third parties, who typically require SRECs to comply with state-imposed renewable portfolio standards. Holders of SRECs may benefit from registering the credits in their name to comply with these state-imposed requirements, or from selling SRECs to a party that requires additional SRECs to meet its compliance obligations. The Company receives SRECs from various state regulators including New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, and Maryland Public Service Commission. There are no direct costs associated with SRECs and therefore, they do not receive an allocation of costs upon generation. The majority of individual SREC sales reflect a fixed quantity and fixed price structure over a specified term. The Company typically sells SRECs to different customers from those purchasing the energy under PPAs. The Company believes the sale of each SREC is a distinct performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and that the performance obligation related to each SREC is satisfied when each SREC is delivered to the customer. 
 Power sales on wholesale markets . A portion of the Company s power sales revenues is earned through the sale of energy (based on kilowatt hours) on the wholesale market operated by PJM Interconnection at floating spot prices. The promise to sell energy on a wholesale market is a separate distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized as energy is delivered at the interconnection point. 
 Rental income . Rental income is primarily derived from the master lease agreement with Vitol (as described in Note 5, "Acquisitions," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report) as well as long-term PPAs accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842. The Company's leases include various renewal options which are included in the lease term when the Company has determined it is reasonably certain of exercising the options based on consideration of all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for the Company as lessor. Certain leases include variable lease payments associated with production of solar facilities, which are recognized as rental income in period the energy is delivered. 
 Performance based incentives . Many state governments, utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a renewable energy facility. Up-front rebates provide funds based on the cost, size or expected production of a renewable energy facility. Performance based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by its renewable energy facility during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. The Company recognizes revenue from state and utility incentives at the point in time in which they are earned. 
 Performance based incentives are primarily represented by cash awards granted to the Company by the New York State Energy Research Development Authority for the development of distributed solar facilities in the State of New York. 
 Revenue recognized on contract liabilities. The Company recognizes contract liabilities related to long-term agreements to sell SRECs that are prepaid by customers before SRECs are delivered. The Company will recognize revenue associated with the contract liabilities as SRECs are delivered to customers through 2037. 
 Cost of operations (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of operations primarily consists of operations and maintenance expense, site lease expense, insurance premiums, property taxes and other miscellaneous costs associated with the operations of solar energy facilities. Altus Power expects its cost of operations to continue to grow in conjunction with its business growth. These costs as a percentage of revenue will decrease over time, offsetting efficiencies and economies of scale with inflationary increases of certain costs. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits and all other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, professional fees related to legal, accounting, human resources, finance and training, information technology and software services, marketing and communications, travel, rent, and other office-related expenses. 
 Altus Power expects increased general and administrative expenses as it continues to grow its business but to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue. Altus Power also expects to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses necessary to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. 
 43 

Securities and Exchange Commission (" SEC "). Further, Altus Power expects to incur higher expenses for investor relations, accounting advisory, directors' and officers insurance, and other professional services. 
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. Depreciation expense represents depreciation on solar energy systems that have been placed in service. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line composite method over the estimated useful lives of assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Amortization includes third party costs necessary to acquire PPA and NMCA customers, value ascribed to in-place leases, and favorable and unfavorable rate revenues contracts. Value ascribed to in-place leases is amortized using the straight-line method ratably over the term of the individual site leases. Third party costs necessary to acquire PPAs and NMCA customers are amortized using the straight-line method ratably over 15-25 years based upon the term of the customer contract. Estimated fair value allocated to the favorable and unfavorable rate PPAs and REC agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective agreements. Accretion expense includes over time increase of asset retirement obligations associated with solar energy facilities. 
 Acquisition and entity formation costs. Acquisition and entity formation costs represent costs incurred to acquire businesses and form new legal entities. Such costs primarily consist of professional fees for banking, legal, accounting and appraisal services . 
 Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration. In connection with various acquisitions, contingent consideration may be payable upon achieving certain conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation model or an expected cash flow approach. Significant assumptions used in the measurement of fair value of contingent consideration associated with various acquisitions include market power rates, estimated volumes of power generation of acquired solar energy facilities, percentage of completion of in-development solar energy facilities, and the risk-adjusted discount rate associated with the business. 
 Gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment. In connection with the disposal of assets, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, which represents the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value of the disposed asset. 
 Stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized for awards granted under the Legacy Incentive Plans and Incentive Plan, as defined in Note 14, "Stock-Based Compensation," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Change in fair value of Alignment Shares liability. Alignment Shares represent Class B common stock of the Company which were issued in connection with the Merger. Class B common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (" Alignment Shares ") are accounted for as liability-classified derivatives, which were remeasured as of September 30, 2024, and the resulting gain was included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimates the fair value of outstanding Alignment Shares using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model utilizing a distribution of potential outcomes based on a set of underlying assumptions such as stock price, volatility, and risk-free interest rates. 
 Other income and expense, net. Other income and expenses primarily represent interest income and other miscellaneous items. 
 Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net represents interest on our borrowings under our various debt facilities, amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs, and unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swaps. 
 Income tax expense and benefit. We account for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. As such, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally, we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income. We have a partial valuation allowance on our deferred state tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred state tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis. 
 Net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represents third-party interests in the net income or loss of certain consolidated subsidiaries based on Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value.

 Percentage is not meaningful 
 Operating revenues, net increased by 13.6 million, or 30.2 , for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to three months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily a result of the following: 
 An increase in power sales of approximately 9.5 million, driven by a 39.3 increase in power generation from 239,000 MWh for three months ended September 30, 2023, to 333,000 MWh for three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in power generated was driven by a 210 MW increase in the weighted average installed capacity primarily as a result of the Caldera Acquisition in December 2023, the Vitol Acquisition in January 2024, and other solar facilities acquired and placed in service by the Company after September 30, 2023. 
 An increase in solar renewable energy credits revenue of 3.7 million is primarily explained by the increase in the number of SRECs sold from solar facilities acquired and placed in service subsequent to September 30, 2023. 
 An increase in rental income of 2.4 million is primarily due to the Vitol Acquisition in January 2024 and lease of certain solar facilities back to Vitol. 
 A decrease in performance based incentives of 1.6 million is due to the New York State Energy Research Development Authority NYSERDA performance based incentives received for the development of solar facilities in the State of New York during three months ended September 30, 2023. No NYSERDA incentives were received during three months ended September 30, 2024.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 5.1 million in relation to pretax income of 3.5 million, which resulted in an effective income tax rate of negative 145.3 . The effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by fair value remeasurement of Alignment Shares, nondeductible compensation, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, and state income taxes. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 1.9 million in relation to a pretax income of 4.8 million, which resulted in an effective income tax rate of negative 39.6 . The effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by fair value remeasurement of Alignment Shares, nondeductible compensation, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, state income taxes, and other miscellaneous items. 
 Related to the fair value remeasurement, the Company has issued Alignment Shares. These awards are liability classified awards for U.S. GAAP, and, as such, they are required to be remeasured to fair value each reporting period with the change in value included in operating income. The Alignment Shares are considered equity awards for U.S. tax purposes. Therefore, the change in U.S. GAAP value does not result in taxable income or deduction. The U.S. GAAP change in fair value results in a permanent tax difference which impacts the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 21.2 million in relation to pretax income of 24.6 million, which resulted in an effective income tax rate of negative 86.5 . The effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by fair value remeasurement of Alignment Shares, nondeductible compensation, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, and state income taxes. Additionally, there was an income tax benefit resulting from the forfeiture of stock awards associated with the CEO transition. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 0.1 million in relation to a pretax income of 14.1 million, which resulted in an effective income tax rate of 0.7 . The effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by fair value remeasurement of Alignment Shares, nondeductible compensation, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, and state income taxes. 
 Related to the fair value remeasurement, the Company has issued Alignment Shares. These awards are liability classified awards for U.S. GAAP, and, as such, they are required to be remeasured to fair value each reporting period with the change in value included in operating income. The Alignment Shares are considered equity awards for U.S. tax purposes. Therefore, the change in U.S. GAAP value does not result in taxable income or deduction. The U.S. GAAP change in fair value results in a permanent tax difference which impacts the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate.

 Net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests increased by 13.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to funding provided by a tax equity investor, changes in income and loss allocations in accordance with agreements, and by loss allocations due to reduced recapture periods for investment tax credits. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of 111.3 million. For a discussion of our restricted cash, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash, to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We seek to maintain diversified and cost-effective funding sources to finance and maintain our operations, fund capital expenditures, including customer acquisitions, and satisfy obligations arising from our indebtedness. Historically, our primary sources of liquidity included proceeds from the issuance of redeemable preferred stock, borrowings under our debt facilities, third party tax equity investors and cash from operations. Our business model requires substantial outside financing arrangements to grow the business and facilitate the deployment of additional solar energy facilities. We will seek to raise additional required capital from borrowings under our existing debt facilities, third party tax equity investors, and cash from operations. 
 The solar energy systems that are in service are expected to generate a positive return rate over the useful life, typically 32 years. After solar energy systems commence operations, they typically do not require significant additional capital expenditures to maintain operating performance. However, in order to grow, we are currently dependent on financing from 
 54 

outside parties. The Company expects to have sufficient cash and cash flows from operations to meet working capital, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated required capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms if and when needed, we may be unable to finance installation of our new customers solar energy systems in a manner consistent with our past performance, our cost of capital could increase, or we may be required to significantly reduce the scope of our operations, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, our tax equity funds and debt instruments impose restrictions on our ability to draw on financing commitments. If we are unable to satisfy such conditions, we may incur penalties for non-performance under certain tax equity funds, experience installation delays, or be unable to make installations in accordance with our plans or at all. Any of these factors could also impact customer satisfaction, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We enter into service agreements in the normal course of business. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments. Certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs. Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors, mainly, to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. The exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination, and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2024, we do not expect to cancel these agreements. 
 The Company has operating leases for land and building rooftops and has contractual commitments to make payments in accordance with site lease agreements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company enters into letters of credit and surety bond arrangements with lenders, local municipalities, government agencies, and land lessors. These arrangements relate to certain performance-related obligations and serve as security under the applicable agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 59.0 million and 60.1 million, respectively. Our outstanding letters of credit are primarily used to fund the debt service reserve accounts associated with our term loans. We believe the Company will fulfill the obligations under the related arrangements and do not anticipate any material losses under these letters of credit or surety bonds. 
 ATM Program 
 On April 6, 2023, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor ), Nomura Securities International, Inc.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, identifiable intangibles, contingent consideration liabilities and deferred income tax valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our condensed consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes to the accounting estimates that we have deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates are more fully described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Other than the policies noted in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Company s notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report, there have been no material changes to its critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in its audited consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company, or an EGC, can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Altus Power has elected to use the extended transition period for new or revised accounting standards during the period in which we remain an EGC. 
 We expect to remain an EGC until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we, as applicable, have more than 1.235 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least 700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; and (4) December 31, 2025, the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report . 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to various market risks in our normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with our business or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transactions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 A significant portion of our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate (for further details refer to Note 6, "Debt," in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). However, changes in interest rates create a modest risk because certain borrowings bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. We sometimes manage our interest rate exposure on floating-rate debt by entering into derivative instruments to hedge all or a portion of our interest rate exposure on certain debt facilities. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and operating expenses and reducing funds available for capital investments, operations, and other purposes. A hypothetical 10 increase in our interest rates on our variable debt facilities would not have a material impact on the value of the Company s cash, cash equivalents, debt, net income, or cash flows. 
 Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments which potentially subject Altus to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and restricted cash. Our investment policy requires cash and restricted cash to be placed with high-quality financial institutions 
 60 

and limits the amount of credit risk from any one issuer. We additionally perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition whenever deemed necessary and generally do not require collateral. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that were disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Remediation Plan 
 As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, with the oversight of senior management and our audit committee, we are taking the steps below and plan to take additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weaknesses: 
 We have proceeded with steps intended to remediate the insufficient qualified personnel material weakness, including the verification that sufficient resources are maintained to operate an effective control environment; 
 We have performed an initial formalized risk assessment for SOX processes, and are remediating identified control gaps; and 
 We have proceeded with steps intended to remediate the selection and development of control activities material weakness through the implementation of numerous controls over systems, process, governance and people to improve the broader effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. 
 We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to implement, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses we have identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As discussed above, we implemented certain measures to remediate the material weaknesses identified in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. Other than those measures, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 71 

make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 Section 2.10 Payments Generally . 
 (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents in respect of principal of, interest on, or other amounts owing in respect of, the Loans shall be made in Dollars pursuant to the Priority of Payments. All amounts payable to the Collateral Agent under this Agreement or otherwise (including, but not limited to, fees) shall be paid to the Collateral Agent for the account of the Person entitled thereto. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Corporate Trust Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 12 00 noon New York City time on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each applicable Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s applicable Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 12 00 noon New York City time shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day, in the Administrative Agent s sole discretion, and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. 
 (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. 
 (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then 
 (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing and 
 72 

(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.10(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
 (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 
 (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 (g) Payment of principal on any Class of Loans shall be applied to each Borrowed Amount of such Class pro rata based on the outstanding principal amount thereof. 
 Section 2.11 Sharing of Payments . If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or any security therefor, any payment or distribution (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) 
 73 

thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or distribution in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment or distribution is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 11.09 with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.11 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

 (ii) Reallocation of Payments .

 74 

Default has occurred and is continuing), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent third , if so determined by the Blackstone Representative and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement fourth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement fifth , so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement and sixth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Article IV were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their Commitments. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

 (ii) Defaulting Lender Cure .

 For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.13(b) shall not have any effect on a Payment Recipient s obligations pursuant to Section 2.13(a) or on whether or not an Erroneous Payment has been made. 
 76 

(c) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender from any source, against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. 
 (d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency ), upon the Administrative Agent s notice to such Lender at any time, then effective immediately (with the consideration therefor being acknowledged by the parties hereto), (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitments) of the relevant class with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment (on a cashless basis and such amount calculated) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants) with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (but the failure of such Person to deliver any such Notes shall not affect the effectiveness of the foregoing assignment), (ii) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender, (iv) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall each be deemed to have waived any consents required under this Agreement to any such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and (v) the Administrative Agent will reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment.

 U.S. federal withholding Tax on any payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
 (iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower and any such Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and each such Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 3.01(d)(iii) , FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date. 
 
 81 

Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders any such documentation described in this Section 3.01(d) obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or such Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent in writing of its inability to do so. 
 (f) If the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.01 to any Lender, or to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender, any such Lender shall, if requested by the Borrower, use its reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office (or take any other measures reasonably requested by the Borrower) if such a change or other measures would reduce any such additional amounts (including any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, result in any unreimbursed cost or expense or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 
 (g) If the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent of either, if applicable) is not a U.S. Person, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (and any sub- agent of either, if applicable), as applicable, shall deliver to the Borrower on or before the date on which it becomes Agent (or sub-agent) under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower) (i) an accurate and complete signed copy of IRS Form W- 8ECI with respect to any amounts payable to such Agent (or sub-agent) for its own account and (ii) an accurate and complete signed copy of IRS Form W-8IMY with respect to any amounts payable to such Agent (or sub-agent) for the account of others, certifying that it is a U.S. branch, and that it is using such form as evidence of its agreement with the Borrower to be treated as a U.S. Person with respect to such payments (and the Borrower and such Agent (and any sub-agent) agree to so treat such Agent (and any sub-agent thereof, if applicable) as a U.S. Person with respect to such payments as contemplated by, and in accordance with, Sections 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) of the United States Treasury Regulations). If the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (and any sub- agent of either, if applicable) is a U.S. Person, it shall deliver to the Borrower on or before the date on which it becomes Agent (or sub-agent) under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower) an accurate and complete Form W-9 setting forth an exemption from backup withholding. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders any such documentation described in this Section 3.01(f) obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower) or promptly notify the Borrower in writing of its inability to do so. 
 (h) If any Lender or Agent receives a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts have been paid pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall promptly remit such refund to the indemnifying party (but only to the extent of indemnification or additional amounts paid under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxing authority with respect to such refund, net of any Taxes payable by any Agent or Lender on such interest) 
 82 

provided that the indemnifying party upon the request of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, agrees promptly to return such refund plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) to such party in the event such party is required to repay such refund to the relevant taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after- Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other person. 
 (i) For the avoidance of doubt, the term Law for purposes of this Section 3.01 includes FATCA.

 (b) If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced 
 83 

rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.03 the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered within ten (10) days after receipt of such demand.

 (d) If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.02 , then such Lender will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.02 in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided further that nothing in this Section 3.02(d) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.02(a) , (b) or (c) . 
 Section 3.03 Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation . 
 (a) Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. 
 (b) With respect to any Lender s claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or 3.02 , the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender for any amount incurred more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event that gives rise to such claim provided that, if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then such nine month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
 Section 3.04 Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances . 
 (a) If at any time (i)(x) the Borrower becomes obligated to pay additional amounts or indemnity payments described in Section 3.01 or 3.02 as a result of any condition described in such Sections and (y) such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.02 , (ii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iii) any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at its sole cost and expense, on five (5) Business Days prior written notice (or such shorter time as the Administrative Agent may agree) to the Administrative Agent and such Lender, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to Section 11.07(b) (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower in such instance) all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees provided that any assignment to any Eligible Assignee of less than all of the rights and obligations of such Lender (including, without limitation, its Commitments and Loans 
 84 

of each Class) must be made in the same proportion among Classes of Loans and Commitments as were held by such Lender prior to such assignment) provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement Lender or other such Person and provided further that (A) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.02 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (B) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable Eligible Assignees shall have agreed to, and shall be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the adoption of, the applicable departure, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
 (b) Any Lender being replaced pursuant to Section 3.04(a)(x) above shall (i) execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender s applicable Commitment and outstanding Loans, and (ii) deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Blackstone Representative.

In connection with any such replacement, if any such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such replacement within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption to such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender, then such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of the Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender. 
 (c) In the event that (i) the Borrower or the Blackstone Representative has requested that the Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the Loan Documents or agree to any amendment thereto, (ii) the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the agreement of each Lender or each affected Lender in accordance with the terms of Section 11.01 and (iii) the Required Lenders have agreed to such consent, waiver or amendment, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender .

 (a) that any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable), (ii) at the time the property subject to such Lien is Disposed or to be Disposed as part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person other than a Person required to grant a Lien to the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents (or, if such transferee is a Person required to grant a Lien to the Collateral Agent on such asset, at the option of the applicable Loan Party, such Lien on such asset may still be released in connection with the transfer so long as (x) the transferee grants a new Lien to the Collateral Agent on such asset substantially concurrently with the transfer of such asset, (y) the transfer is between parties organized under the laws of different jurisdictions and at least one of such parties is a Foreign Subsidiary and (z) the priority of the new Lien is the same as that of the original Lien and the Lien of the Secured Parties on such asset is 
 164 

not impaired or otherwise adversely affected by such release and granting of such new Lien as reasonably determined by the Blackstone Representative), (iii) subject to Section 11.01 , if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty pursuant to clause (b) below, (v) to the extent (and only for so long as) such property constitutes an Excluded Asset or (vi) if the release of such Lien on such property is permitted under the terms of each applicable Collateral Document and 
 (b) that any Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under the Guaranty if (i) such Guarantor is no longer a Subsidiary of the Borrower or (ii) subject to Section 11.01 , if such release is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders.

In each case as specified in this Section 10.11 , the Collateral Agent will promptly upon the request of the Borrower (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent to), at the Borrower s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as the Borrower may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of a Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 10.11 (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry). Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Collateral Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, no release of Collateral or a Guarantor effected in the manner permitted by this Section 10.11 shall require the consent of any holder of obligations under any Permitted Hedge Agreement. 
 Section 10.12 Reserved . 
 Section 10.13 Appointment of Supplemental Agents . 
 (a) It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Blackstone Representative, Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Blackstone Representative, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the Blackstone Representative, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such additional 
 165 

individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a Supplemental Agent and collectively as Supplemental Agents ). 
 (b) In the event that the Collateral Agent appoints a Supplemental Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Collateral Agent or such Supplemental Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Article X and of Sections 10.04 and 10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Agent and all references therein to the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Collateral Agent and or such Supplemental Agent, as the context may require.

 Section 10.14 Withholding Tax Indemnity . To the extent required by any applicable law, the applicable Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that such Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify such Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, indemnify and hold harmless the applicable Agent (to the extent that such Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02 and without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Borrower to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by such Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by an Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
 166 

against any amount due an Agent under this Section 10.14 . The agreements in this Section 10.14 shall survive the resignation and or replacement of an Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

 (b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not,

If the Document Custodian receives instructions from the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Manager or the Borrower that conflict with any instructions received by the Blackstone Representative after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Document Custodian shall rely on and follow the instructions given by the Blackstone Representative. The Borrower (or the 
 168 

Collateral Manager on its behalf) may cause the release of Custody Documents, in each case (1) to the extent such documents are no longer required to be held hereunder and (2) subject to the written approval by the Blackstone Representative, by delivery of a request for release substantially in the form of Exhibit N hereto from the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) and such request for release shall be deemed a certification that such conditions for release have been satisfied.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Document Custodian shall be entitled to resign, and may be removed, in the same manner as the Collateral Agent provided that the Collateral Agent and the Document Custodian shall at all times be the same institution (or an Affiliate thereof).
