During the fourth quarter of 2023, IAC moved Roofing to Emerging Other and prior period financial information has been recast to conform to this presentation. Following IAC's move of Roofing to Emerging Other, Angi has operating segments: (i) Ads and Leads, (ii) Services and (iii) International (includes Europe and Canada).

 million, which synthetically converted a portion of the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B due December 1, 2028 ("Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B") from a variable rate to a fixed rate to manage interest rate risk exposure for the period commencing April 3, 2023 and ending April 1, 2027. Dotdash Meredith designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and applies hedge accounting to these contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . As cash flow hedges, the interest rate swaps are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities, with the changes in fair value recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the balance sheet and reclassified into Interest expense in the statement of operations in the periods in which the interest rate swaps affect earnings. Dotdash Meredith assessed hedge effectiveness at the time of entering into these agreements and determined these interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective. Dotdash Meredith evaluates the hedge effectiveness of the interest rate swaps quarterly, or more frequently, if necessary, by verifying (i) that the critical terms of the interest rate swaps continue to match the critical terms of the hedged interest payments and (ii) that it is probable the counterparties will not default. If the two requirements are met, the interest rate swaps are determined to be effective and all changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss." The cash flows related to interest settlements of the hedged monthly interest payments are classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows, consistent with the interest expense on the related Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B. See " Note 3 Long-term Debt " for additional information.

The change in the deferred revenue balance from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 also reflects the reduction of million related to the sale of Mosaic Group in the first quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2022. The current and non-current deferred revenue balances were million and million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. Non-current deferred revenue is included in "Other long-term liabilities" in the balance sheet.

 NOTE 2 
 Total marketable securities 
 Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The Company has investments in marketable equity securities, following the change in classification of its investment in MGM Resorts International ("MGM") to an equity method investment in the fourth quarter of 2023, described below. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023 , the Company had investments in marketable equity securities, other than its investment in MGM, including one investment that was fully impaired in the first quarter of 2023 due to the investee declaring bankruptcy and another investment that was sold in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of million. The Company recorded a net unrealized pre-tax loss of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for these investments. The realized and unrealized pre-tax gain and loss related to these investments are included in "Other income, net" in the statement of operations. 
 Total available-for-sale marketable debt securities 
 The contractual maturities of debt securities classified as current available-for-sale at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were within one year. There were investments in available-for-sale marketable debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for longer than twelve months at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 million common shares of MGM, which represents of MGM's common shares outstanding . During the fourth quarter of 2023, due to MGM's ongoing share repurchase program, which passively increased the Company's ownership interest, the Company determined that the equity method of accounting applied and elected to account for its investment in MGM pursuant to the fair value option. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company's investment in MGM was accounted for as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value, with changes in fair value recognized through income each period. Since the Company has always marked its investment in MGM to fair value through income each period the election of the fair value option results in no change from its historical accounting for this investment. The fair value of the investment in MGM is remeasured each reporting period based upon MGM's closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day in the reporting period and any unrealized pre-tax gains or losses are included in the statement of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded unrealized pre-tax losses on its investment in MGM of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an unrealized pre-tax loss and gain on its investment of MGM of million and million , respectively. The cumulative unrealized net pre-tax gain through September 30, 2024 is billion . A 2.00 increase or decrease in the share price of MGM would result in an unrealized gain or loss, respectively, of million. At November 8, 2024, the fair value of the Company's investment in MGM was billion .

 The cumulative upward and downward adjustments (including impairments) to the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held at September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively. 
 ) Unrealized pre-tax (losses) gains, net, on equity securities held ) ) Total pre-tax (losses) gains, net recognized ) ) ) 
 All pre-tax gains and losses on equity securities without readily determinable fair values, realized and unrealized, are recognized in "Other income, net" in the statement of operations. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 
 Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
 Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial assets are primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded. Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case an average market price is used. 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.

 Warrant 
 The Company owns preferred shares of Turo Inc. ("Turo"), a peer-to-peer car sharing marketplace, which are accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value, as the preferred shares are not common stock equivalents. As part of the Company's original investment in Turo preferred shares, the Company received a warrant that was recorded at fair value each reporting period with any change in fair value included in "Other income, net" in the statement of operations. The warrant was measured using significant unobservable inputs and classified in the fair value hierarchy table as Level 3. The Company net settled its Turo warrant on July 23, 2024 (the warrant expiration date) for million shares of Series E-2 preferred stock and the fair value of the warrant of million was reclassified to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The Company had measured this warrant at fair value at June 30, 2024 using the settlement value of the shares received pursuant to its net exercise on July 23, 2024. For the periods prior to the settlement, the warrant was included in "Other non-current assets" in the balance sheet. 
 Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
 The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, ROU assets, buildings, capitalized software, equipment and leasehold improvements, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment is recognized. The Company's financial assets, comprising equity securities without readily determinable fair values, are adjusted to fair value when observable price changes for similar or identical securities are identified or an impairment is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs. 
 Goodwill 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company reassessed the fair value of the Mosaic Group reporting unit (included in the Emerging Other segment prior to the sale of its assets on February 15, 2024) and recorded a goodwill impairment of million, as a result of the projected reduction in future revenue and profits from the business and lower trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies.

 million. The impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is included in Amortization of intangibles in the statement of operations. The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty discounted cash flow ("DCF") valuation analysis. 
 
 ROU Assets and Related Leasehold Improvements, Furniture and Equipment 
 During the first quarter of 2023, Dotdash Meredith recorded impairment charges of million related to certain unoccupied leased office space due to the continued decline in the commercial real estate market consisting of impairments of million and million of an ROU asset and related leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment, respectively. 
 The impairment charges related to ROU assets are included in "General and administrative expense" and the impairment charges related to leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment are included in "Depreciation" in the statement of operations. The impairment charges represent the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value, calculated using a DCF approach using sublease market assumptions of the expected cash flows and discount rate. The impairment charges were allocated between the ROU assets and related leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment of the asset group based on their relative carrying values. 
 Financial instruments measured at fair value only for disclosure purposes

 million Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A due December 1, 2026 ("Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A"), (ii) the billion Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B (together with the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A, the "Dotdash Meredith Term Loans") and (iii) a million revolving credit facility ("Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility"). The Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A bears interest at an adjusted term secured overnight financing rate ("Adjusted Term SOFR") as defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin depending on Dotdash Meredith's most recently reported consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement. The adjustment to the secured overnight financing rate is fixed at for the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A. The Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B has a varying adjustment of , or based upon the duration of the borrowing period. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A bore interest at Adjusted Term SOFR plus , or and , respectively, and the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B bore interest at Adjusted Term SOFR, subject to a minimum of , plus , or and , respectively. Interest payments are due at least quarterly through the terms of the Dotdash Meredith Term Loans. 
 In March 2023, Dotdash Meredith entered into interest rate swaps on the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B for a total notional amount of million with a maturity date of April 1, 2027. The interest rate swaps synthetically converted million of the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B for the duration of the interest rate swaps from a variable rate to a fixed rate of approximately ((i) the weighted average fixed interest rate of approximately on the interest rate swaps plus (ii) the adjustment to the secured overnight financing rate of plus (iii) the base rate of ), beginning on April 3, 2023. 
 The interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective. See " Note 4 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " for the net unrealized gains and losses before reclassifications in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and realized gains reclassified into "Interest expense" for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. At September 30, 2024, less than million is expected to be reclassified into interest expense within the next twelve months as net realized losses. 
 
 The Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A requires quarterly principal payments of approximately million through December 31, 2024, million through December 31, 2025 and approximately million thereafter through maturity. The Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B requires quarterly payments of million through maturity. The Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B may require additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which, in part, is governed by the applicable net leverage ratio and further subject to the excess cash flow exceeding million as defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement. No such payment was required related to the period ended December 31, 2023. 
 There were outstanding borrowings under the Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is based on Dotdash Meredith's consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement, most recently reported and was basis points at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Any borrowings under the Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility would bear interest, at Dotdash Meredith's option, at either a base rate or Adjusted Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin, which is based on Dotdash Meredith's consolidated net leverage ratio. 
 As of the last day of any calendar quarter, if either (i) or more of loans under the Dotdash Meredith Revolving Facility or Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A are outstanding, or (ii) the outstanding face amount of undrawn letters of credit, other than cash collateralized letters of credit at of face value, exceeds million, subject to certain increases for qualifying material acquisitions, then Dotdash Meredith will not permit the consolidated net leverage ratio, which permits netting of up to million in cash and cash equivalents, as of the last day of such quarter to exceed to 1.0. This ratio was not exceeded for both test periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement also contains covenants that would limit Dotdash Meredith s ability to pay dividends, incur incremental secured indebtedness, or make distributions or certain investments in the event a default has occurred or if Dotdash Meredith s consolidated net leverage ratio exceeds to 1.0, subject to certain available amounts as defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement. This ratio was exceeded for both test periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The Company froze and terminated the domestic funded pension plan as of December 31, 2022. The last of the required customary regulatory approvals of the termination of this plan was received in February 2024. In connection with the termination of this plan, the liabilities were settled through a combination of (i) lump sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive them and (ii) the purchase of annuity contracts for participants who either did not elect lump sums or were already receiving benefits. During the third quarter of 2024, the domestic funded pension plan s remaining assets of million were transferred to a suspense account in the trust for the IAC Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the "IAC Plan"), a qualified retirement plan ("QRP"). In accordance with Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") requirements, assets in the suspense account are to be allocated to active Dotdash Meredith participants in the IAC Plan no less than ratably over a period not to exceed seven years, which may be accelerated. During the third quarter of 2024, Dotdash Meredith made its first asset allocation under the requirements. The assets were transferred to a fund that is considered to be a fair value hierarchy Level 2 investment. The amount transferred to the QRP is reflected as a retirement investment fund in "Other non-current assets" in the balance sheet, and the account is restricted in nature. 
 The actuarial gain of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily relates to the final annuity contract pricing and lump sum payments for the domestic funded pension plan, partially offset by investment performance and plan expenses. The actuarial gain of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily relates to updates to participant census data, investment performance and an increase in the discount rate.

 million and million, respectively, which represents an effective income tax rate of and , respectively. Following the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interests of a foreign subsidiary, we reorganized related business operations, which resulted in the release of a valuation allowance for foreign net operating losses in the amount of million as a discrete item in the third quarter because we are now forecasting the utilization of the net operating losses within the foreseeable future. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the valuation allowance release mentioned above and state taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the valuation allowance release mentioned above, research credits and the realization of capital losses, partially offset by nondeductible compensation expense and the nondeductible portion of goodwill in the sale of Mosaic Group. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of million and million, respectively, which represents an effective income tax rate of and , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 21 due primarily to state taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 21 due primarily to non-deductible compensation expense, return to provision adjustments, foreign income taxed at different statutory rates and unconsolidated tax losses, partially offset by research credits and the realization of capital losses. 
 The Company's income taxes are routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities as a result of previously filed separate company and consolidated tax returns for periods prior to the June 30, 2020 separation of IAC from Match Group, Inc. (the "Match Separation") and for its tax returns filed on a standalone basis following the Match Separation. These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. The Company is not currently under audit by the IRS. Returns filed in various other jurisdictions are open to examination for tax years beginning with 2014. Income taxes payable include unrecognized tax benefits considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from the examination of prior year tax returns. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes and, therefore, may require periodic adjustment. Although management currently believes changes in unrecognized tax benefits from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. 
 The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accruals for interest and penalties are not material. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, were million and million, respectively. Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at September 30, 2024 increased by million due primarily to research credits. If unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 are subsequently recognized, million, net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax expense. The comparable amount at December 31, 2023 was million. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by million by September 30, 2025 due to expected settlements and statute expirations, all of which would reduce the income tax provision.

 (a) On November 5, 2020, IAC's CEO was granted a stock-based award in the form of million shares of restricted common stock (the "restricted shares"). The number of restricted shares that ultimately vests is subject to the satisfaction of growth targets in IAC's stock price over the service condition of the award. These restricted shares have a non-forfeitable dividend right in the event the Company declares a cash dividend on its common shares and participate in all other distributions of the Company in the same manner as all other IAC common shares. Accordingly, the two-class method of calculating EPS is used. While the restricted shares are presented as outstanding shares in the balance sheet, these shares are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding in calculating basic EPS and the allocable portion of net earnings are also excluded. Fully diluted EPS reflects the impact on earnings and fully diluted shares in the manner that is most dilutive. 
 (b) IAC has the option to settle certain Angi stock-based awards in its shares. The impact on net earnings relates to the settlement of Angi's dilutive securities in IAC common shares. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, these Angi equity awards were anti-dilutive. 
 (c) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a loss from operations and as a result approximately million and million of potentially dilutive securities, respectively, were excluded from computing diluted EPS for each of those periods because the impact would have been anti-dilutive. Accordingly, the weighted average basic shares outstanding were used to compute the EPS amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

These costs were allocated from IAC based upon time spent on Angi by Mr. Levin. Management considers the allocation method to be reasonable. The allocated costs also include costs directly attributable to Angi that were initially paid for by IAC and billed by IAC to Angi. 
 On April 8, 2024, Jeffrey W. Kip, President of Angi, was appointed to succeed Joseph Levin as CEO of Angi. Mr. Levin remains Chairman of the Angi board of directors. 
 The Combination and Related Agreements 
 The Company and Angi, in connection with the transaction resulting in the formation of Angi in 2017, which is referred to as the "Combination," entered into a contribution agreement; an investor rights agreement; a services agreement; a tax sharing agreement; and an employee matters agreement, which collectively govern the relationship between IAC and Angi. 
 IAC and Vimeo Inc. ("Vimeo") 
 In connection with the spin-off of Vimeo from IAC, the parties entered in several agreements to govern their relationship following the completion of the transaction, certain of which remain in effect and are as follows: a separation agreement, a tax matters agreement and an employee matters agreement. Following the completion of the transaction, Vimeo and IAC entered into certain commercial agreements, including lease agreements. The Company and Vimeo are related parties because Mr. Diller is the beneficial owner of more than percent of the voting interests in both IAC and Vimeo. 
 The Company charged Vimeo rent pursuant to lease agreements of million and million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had non-current rent receivable amounts of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, due from Vimeo pursuant to the lease agreements. These amounts are included in "Other non-current assets" in the balance sheet. 
 IAC and Expedia Group 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company and Expedia Group each had a ownership interest in aircraft that may be used by both companies. Members of the aircraft flight crews are employed by an entity in which the Company and Expedia Group each have a ownership interest. The Company and Expedia Group have agreed to share costs relating to flight crew compensation and benefits pro-rata according to each company s respective usage of the aircraft, for which they are separately billed by the entity described above. The Company and Expedia Group are related parties because Mr. Diller serves as Chairman and Senior Executive of both IAC and Expedia Group. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total payments made to this entity by the Company were not material. 
 Expedia Group may also use certain aircraft owned by a subsidiary of the Company on a cost basis. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the payments made by Expedia Group to the Company pursuant to this arrangement were not material. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company and Expedia Group entered into a lease agreement, commencing October 2024, for Expedia Group to occupy office space in the Company's New York City headquarters building. The total payments pursuant to this lease agreement are not material.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

GENERAL 
 Management Overview 
 IAC today is comprised of category leading businesses, including Dotdash Meredith, Angi Inc. and Care.com, as well as others ranging from early stage to established businesses. 
 As used herein, "IAC," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us" and similar terms refer to IAC Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise). 
 For a more detailed description of the Company's operating businesses, see "Description of IAC Businesses" included in "Item 1 Business" to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Defined Terms and Operating Metrics: 
 Unless otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires, certain terms used in this quarterly report, which include the principal operating metrics we use in managing our business, are defined below: 
 IAC Businesses (for additional information see " Note 5 Segment Information " to the financial statements included in " Item 1 Consolidated Financial Statements "): 
 Dotdash Meredith - one of the largest digital and print publishers in America. Nearly 200 million people trust Dotdash Meredith to help them make decisions, take action and find inspiration. Dotdash Meredith's over 40 iconic brands include People, Better Homes Gardens, Verywell, FOOD WINE, The Spruce, allrecipes, Byrdie, REAL SIMPLE, Investopedia and Southern Living. Dotdash Meredith has two operating segments: (i) Digital, which includes its digital, mobile and licensing operations; and (ii) Print, which includes its magazine subscription and newsstand operations; 
 Angi Inc. ("Angi") - a publicly traded company that connects quality home professionals with consumers across more than 500 different categories, from repairing and remodeling homes to cleaning and landscaping.

The decrease in membership subscription revenue was due primarily to a decrease in professionals in the Angi network. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to an increase in advertising sold through Angi's sales force. 
 The Services decrease was due primarily to a lower amount of Service Requests as a result of certain efforts described in Ads and Leads above. 
 The International increase was driven by a larger professional network and higher revenue per professional. 
 Search revenue decreased 47 to 88.3 million due to a decrease of 74.8 million, or 51 , from Ask Media Group, resulting from a reduction in marketing from affiliate partners that drove fewer visitors to our ad supported search and content websites.

See " Note 2 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements " to the financial statements included in " Item 1 Consolidated Financial Statements " for additional information about the impairment charge. 
 The Angi decrease was due primarily to decreases of 30.6 million from Ads and Leads and 12.5 million from Services.

 Depreciation in 2024 decreased due primarily to decreases of 4.9 million and 3.0 million at Angi and Dotdash Meredith, respectively. The decrease at Angi was due primarily to the write-off of certain leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures in connection with Angi reducing its real estate footprint in the first half of 2024 and the reduction in depreciation of capitalized software as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated. The decrease at Dotdash Meredith was due primarily to the acceleration of depreciation on certain assets in 2023.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating income increased 49.1 million in 2024 to 16.3 million from a loss of 32.7 million in 2023, due primarily to a decrease of 25.0 million in amortization of intangibles, the inclusion in the prior year period of a goodwill impairment of 9.0 million at Mosaic Group, a decrease of 7.3 million in depreciation, an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of 7.0 million, described below, and a decrease of 0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in the amortization of intangibles was due primarily to lower expense at Dotdash Meredith and Angi due in part to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized and the inclusion in prior year of a 7.6 million indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment at the Dotdash Meredith Digital segment, partially offset by an increase in expense as a result of a change in classification of certain Dotdash Meredith Digital trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets to definite-lived intangible assets, effective January 1, 2024 . The goodwill impairment at Mosaic Group in 2023 was a result of the projected reduction in future revenue and profits from the business and lower trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. The decrease in depreciation was due primarily to write-off, in the first half of 2024, of certain leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures in connection with Angi reducing its real estate footprint, the reduction in depreciation of capitalized software as result of certain assets being fully depreciated at Angi and a decrease in depreciation at Dotdash Meredith related to the acceleration of depreciation on certain assets in 2023.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating loss decreased 169.0 million, or 75 , due primarily to a decrease of 60.4 million in amortization of intangibles, an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of 58.0 million, described below, and decrease of 39.8 million in depreciation, a goodwill impairment of 9.0 million at Mosaic Group recognized in the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 1.9 million in stock-based compensation expense. The decreases in the amortization of intangibles and depreciation and the goodwill impairment at Mosaic Group in 2023 are due primarily to the factors described above in the three-month discussion. Depreciation was further impacted by the impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment of 25.3 million related to unoccupied lease space recognized in the first quarter of 2023 at Dotdash Meredith. 
 See " Note 2 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements " to the financial statements included in " Item 1 Consolidated Financial Statements " for additional information on the 2023 Mosaic Group goodwill impairment, the Dotdash Meredith Digital 2023 indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment and the Dotdash Meredith 2023 leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment impairment charge.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, due to MGM's ongoing share repurchase program, which passively increased the Company's ownership interest, the Company determined that the equity method of accounting applied and elected to account for its investment in MGM pursuant to the fair value option. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company's investment in MGM was accounted for as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value, with changes in fair value recognized through income each period. Since the Company has always marked its investment in MGM to fair value through income each period the election of the fair value option results in no change to the historical accounting for this investment. 
 The unrealized pre-tax (losses) and gains on the Company's investment in MGM were due to changes in the stock price of MGM's common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on the number of MGM common shares outstanding at September 30, 2024, the Company owns approximately 21.8 of MGM.

 In 2024, the effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate due primarily to the valuation allowance release for foreign net operating losses and state taxes. Following the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interests of a foreign subsidiary, we reorganized related business operations, which resulted in the release of a valuation allowance for foreign net operating losses in the amount of 31.3 million as a discrete item in the third quarter because we are now forecasting the utilization of the net operating losses within the foreseeable future.

 PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 The Company reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). This measure is considered our primary segment measure of profitability and one of the metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses and our internal budgets are based and may also impact management compensation. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The Company endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below. 
 Definition of Non-GAAP Measure 
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements, if applicable. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses.

 Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded from Our Non-GAAP Measure 
 Stock-based compensation expense consists of expense associated with awards that were granted under various IAC stock and annual incentive plans and expense related to awards issued by certain subsidiaries of the Company. These expenses are not paid in cash and we view the economic costs of stock-based awards to be the dilution to our share base; we also include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding for GAAP earnings per share using the treasury stock method. The Company is currently settling all stock-based awards on a net basis; IAC remits the required tax-withholding amounts for net-settled awards from its current funds.

 Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our buildings, capitalized software, equipment and leasehold improvements and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter. 
 Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as advertiser relationships, technology, licensee relationships, trade names, content, customer lists and user base, professional relationships and subscriber relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairments of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business. 
 Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report liabilities for the portion of the purchase price of acquisitions, if applicable, that is contingent upon the financial performance and/or operating targets of the acquired company at fair value that are recognized in "General and administrative expense" in the statement of operations. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.

 Cash Flow Information 
 In summary, IAC's cash flows are as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 244,425 142,644 Investing activities 264,591 (103,365) Financing activities (84,692) (204,598) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consists of net earnings (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital. Non-cash adjustments include the unrealized loss (gain) on the investment in MGM, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense (including ROU impairments), provision for credit losses, unrealized (increase) decrease in the estimated fair value of a warrant, net gains on sales of businesses and investments in equity securities (including downward and upward adjustments) and goodwill impairment. 
 2024 
 Adjustments to net loss consist primarily of an unrealized loss on the investment in MGM of 361.8 million, amortization of intangibles of 109.8 million, depreciation of 96.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of 86.2 million, provision of credit losses of 46.0 million and non-cash lease expense of 42.6 million, partially offset by deferred income taxes of 109.9 million, an unrealized increase in the estimated fair value of a warrant of 20.4 million and net gains on sales of businesses and investments in equity securities (including downward and upward adjustments) of 16.5 million, including 29.2 million gain on the sale of assets at Mosaic Group in February 2024. The decrease from changes in working capital include decreases in accounts payable and other liabilities of 58.9 million and operating lease liabilities of 51.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in other assets of 88.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 8.9 million. The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities is due primarily to a decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to timing of payments, including the payment of 2023 bonuses in 2024, and a decrease in accrued traffic acquisition costs and related payables at Search and Dotdash Meredith, partially offset by an increase in accrued advertising at Search and Angi. The decrease in operating lease liabilities is due to cash payments on leases net of interest accretion. The decrease in other assets is due primarily to a decrease in prepaid hosting services at Dotdash Meredith, Corporate and Angi, receipt of pre-acquisition income tax refunds at Dotdash Meredith, the liquidation of the domestic funded pension plan at Dotdash Meredith in connection with the termination of the plan and payment received related to insurance coverage for previously incurred legal fees at Angi. The decrease in accounts receivable is due primarily to a decrease in revenue in the third quarter of 2024 relative to the fourth quarter of 2023 at Dotdash Meredith and Search, and a decrease at Mosaic Group due to cash receipts prior to the sale of its assets, partially offset by an increase at Angi due primarily to timing of cash receipts. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities includes maturities of marketable debt securities of 350.0 million, net proceeds from the sales of businesses and investments of 173.6 million, including 155 million from the sale of assets of Mosaic Group, net proceeds from the sales of assets of 12.8 million principally from the sale of an aircraft at Dotdash Meredith, and a decrease in notes receivable of 10.1 million, partially offset by 221.8 million for the purchases of marketable debt securities, capital expenditures of 47.3 million, primarily related to investments of 36.9 million in capitalized software at Angi to support its products and services, and the purchase of a retirement investment fund of 15.3 million at Dotdash Meredith in connection with the termination of the domestic funded pension plan and transfer of the remaining assets to the IAC Inc. Retirement Savings Plan. 
 Net cash used in financing activities includes the repurchase of 11.4 million shares of Angi Class A common stock, on a settlement date basis, for 25.7 million at an average price of 2.25 per share, principal payments on Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A and Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B of 22.5 million, purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interests of a foreign subsidiary at Angi of 16.0 million, withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees, excluding Angi for stock-based awards that were net settled of 14.6 million and withholding taxes paid on behalf of Angi employees for stock-based awards that were net settled of 5.7 million.

Table of Contents 

 2023 
 Adjustments to net loss consist primarily of amortization of intangibles of 170.2 million, depreciation of 136.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of 88.1 million, non-cash lease expense of 85.6 million, provision for credit losses of 71.3 million, goodwill impairment of 9.0 million and an unrealized decrease in the estimated fair value of a warrant of 1.3 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain on the investment in MGM of 209.1 million, deferred income taxes of 17.6 million and net gains on investments in equity securities and sales of businesses (including upward and downward adjustments) of 2.5 million. The decrease from changes in working capital include decreases in accounts payable and other liabilities of 82.7 million and operating lease liabilities of 56.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in other assets of 10.0 million, an increase in deferred revenue of 8.7 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 7.1 million. The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities is due, in part, to a decrease in accrued employee compensation, due primarily to restructuring related severance payments at Dotdash Meredith and timing of payments, and a decrease in accrued traffic acquisition costs and related payables at Dotdash Meredith and Search. The decrease in operating lease liabilities is due to cash payments on leases net of interest accretion. The decrease in other assets is due, in part, to refunds of pre-acquisition income tax receivables at Dotdash Meredith and timing of payments. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to the timing of annual subscription renewals and subscription growth at Care.com and timing of cash receipts at Angi. The decrease in accounts receivable is due primarily to a decrease in revenue relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 at Dotdash Meredith and Search, partially offset by an increase at Angi due to timing of cash receipts. 
 Net cash used in investing activities includes 320.1 million for the purchases of marketable debt securities, capital expenditures of 126.6 million, primarily related to payment of approximately 80 million for the acquisition of the formerly leased land under IAC's New York City headquarters building as well as investments of 34.0 million in capitalized software at Angi to support its products and services and 103.6 million for the purchase of additional shares of Turo Inc. ("Turo"), partially offset by maturities of marketable debt securities of 387.5 million, proceeds from the sales of assets of 29.0 million, including 28.2 million related to the sale of a building at Dotdash Meredith, a decrease in notes receivable of 11.3 million and net proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments of 9.2 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities includes the repurchase of 3.2 million shares of IAC common stock, on a settlement date basis, for 165.6 million at an average price of 51.00 per share, principal payments on Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A and Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B of 22.5 million, withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees, excluding Angi, for stock-based awards that were net settled of 8.3 million, withholding taxes paid on behalf of Angi employees for stock-based awards that were net settled of 4.8 million and the repurchase of 1.1 million shares of Angi Class A common stock, on a settlement date basis, for 3.4 million at an average price of 3.22 per share. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Investment in MGM 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company owns 64.7 million common shares of MGM. Based on the number of MGM common shares outstanding at September 30, 2024, the Company owns 21.8 o f MGM . 
 Investment in Turo 
 The Company net settled its Turo warrant on July 23, 2024 (the warrant expiration date) for 4.5 million shares of Series E-2 preferred stock, bringing IAC's ownership percentage in Turo to approximately 32 at September 30, 2024. 
 Share Repurchase Authorizations and Activity 
 At November 8, 2024, IAC has 3.7 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Angi repurchased 11.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, on a trade date basis, at an average price of 2.25 per share, or 25.6 million in aggregate. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Angi announced its intent to repurchase the 14.0 million shares remaining in its stock repurchase authorization from March 2020 (the "2020 Share Authorization"). On August 2, 2024, the board of directors of Angi approved a new stock repurchase authorization of 25 million shares (the "2024 Share Authorization"). As of August 19, 2024, Angi had no shares remaining under the 2020 Authorization. From October 1, 2024 through November 8, 2024, Angi repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares of its common stock, on a trade date basis, at an average price of 2.49 per share, or 2.8 million in aggregate. As of November 8, 2024, Angi had 23.1 million shares remaining in its 2024 Share Authorization.

Table of Contents 

 IAC and Angi may repurchase shares pursuant to their repurchase authorizations over an indefinite period of time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, price and future outlook. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 At September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations disclosures as of December 31, 2023, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. The Company's 2024 capital expenditures are expected to be lower than its 2023 capital expenditures of 141.4 million by approximately 45 to 50 , due primarily to the acquisition of the formerly leased land under IAC's New York City headquarters building in 2023, partially offset by an increase related to capitalized software at Angi. 
 Liquidity Assessment 
 On a consolidated basis, the Company generated positive cash flows from operating activities of 244.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024; excluding the positive cash flows from operating activities of 115.9 million and 113.3 million generated by Angi and Dotdash Meredith, respectively, the Company generated positive cash flows from operating activities of 15.3 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company's consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding MGM, were 1.7 billion, of which 395.2 million and 264.0 million was held by Angi and Dotdash Meredith, respectively. The Company's consolidated debt includes approximately 1.5 billion, which is the liability of Dotdash Meredith Inc., and 500.0 million, which is the liability of ANGI Group, a subsidiary of Angi. 
 The Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement contains covenants that would limit Dotdash Meredith s ability to pay dividends, incur incremental secured indebtedness, or make distributions or certain investments in the event a default has occurred or if Dotdash Meredith s consolidated net leverage ratio exceeds 4.0 to 1.0, subject to certain available amounts as defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement. This ratio was exceeded for the test period ended September 30, 2024. The Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement also permits IAC to, among other things, contribute cash to Dotdash Meredith which will provide additional liquidity to ensure that Dotdash Meredith does not exceed certain consolidated net leverage ratios for any test period, as further defined in the Dotdash Meredith Credit Agreement. In connection with these capital contributions, Dotdash Meredith may make distributions to IAC in amounts not more than any such capital contributions, provided that no default has occurred and is continuing. Such capital contributions and subsequent distributions impact the consolidated net leverage ratios of Dotdash Meredith. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company contributed 20 million and 125 million, respectively, to Dotdash Meredith, following which Dotdash Meredith distributed 20 million in October 2024 back to the Company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Dotdash Meredith distributed back to the Company 50 million and 210 million, respectively, including 105 million in January 2024 related to the Company's contribution in December 2023. See " Note 3 Long-term Debt " to the financial statements included in " Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements " for additional information. 
 Angi is an independent public company with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds. As a result, the Company cannot freely access the cash of Angi and its subsidiaries. 
 The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for its products and services due to economic or other factors. 
 The Company believes Angi's and Dotdash Meredith's existing cash, cash equivalents and expected positive cash flows from operations, and the Company's existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and expected positive cash flows from operations, excluding Angi and Dotdash Meredith, will be sufficient to fund their respective normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards and investing and other commitments for the next twelve months. The Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to make acquisitions and investments. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all, and may also be impacted by any disruptions in the financial markets. The indebtedness at Dotdash Meredith and Angi could further limit the Company's ability to raise additional financing.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Equity Price Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company owns 64.7 million common shares of MGM. During the fourth quarter of 2023, due to MGM's ongoing share repurchase program, which passively increased the Company's ownership interest, the Company determined that the equity method of accounting applied and elected to account for its investment in MGM pursuant to the fair value option. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company's investment in MGM was accounted for as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value, with changes in fair value recognized through income each period. Since the Company has always marked its investment in MGM to fair value through income each period the election of the fair value option results in no change from its historical accounting for this investment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded unrealized pre-tax losses on its investment in MGM of 346.3 million and 361.8 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an unrealized pre-tax loss and gain on its investment of MGM of 463.4 million and 209.1 million , respectively. 
 The cumulative unrealized net pre-tax gain through September 30, 2024 is 1.3 billion. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company's investment in MGM, which includes the cumulative unrealized pre-tax gains, was 2.5 billion and 2.9 billion, or approximately 26 and 28 of the Company's consolidated total assets, respectively. A 2.00 increase or decrease in the share price of MGM would result in an unrealized gain or loss, respectively, of 129.4 million. At November 8, 2024, the fair value of the Company's investment in MGM was 2.4 billion . The Company's results of operations and financial condition have in the past been and may in the future be materially impacted by increases or decreases in the price of MGM common shares, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, the principal amount of the Company's outstanding debt totals 2.02 billion, of which 1.52 billion is the Dotdash Meredith Term Loans, which bear interest at a variable rate, and 500 million is the ANGI Group Senior Notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate. 
 In March 2023, Dotdash Meredith entered into interest rate swaps on the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B for a total notional amount of 350 million, which synthetically converted a portion of the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B from a variable rate to a fixed rate to manage interest rate exposure for the period commencing April 3, 2023 and ending April 1, 2027, and applies hedge accounting to these contracts. See " Note 1 The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " and " Note 3 Long-term Debt " to the financial statements included in " Item 1 Consolidated Financial Statements " for more information. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using discounted cash flows derived from observable market prices, including swap curves, and represents what Dotdash Meredith would pay or receive to terminate the swap agreements. Dotdash Meredith intends to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, however, if these interest rate swaps were not highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps used as hedges could have a significant impact on future results of operations. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate ("Adjusted Term SOFR") for the Dotdash Meredith Term Loans decreased an average of approximately 12 basis points relative to December 31, 2023. This decrease was largely in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and, therefore, had Adjusted Term SOFR been unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of this decrease would have had a nominal effect on interest expense. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of 1.22 billion related to the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan B bore interest at Adjusted SOFR, subject to a minimum of 0.50 , plus 4.00 , or 9.30 , and the outstanding balance of 301.9 million related to the Dotdash Meredith Term Loan A bore interest at Adjusted Term SOFR plus 2.25 , or 7.68 . If Adjusted Term SOFR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the annual interest expense on the Dotdash Meredith Term Loans, net of the impact related to the 350 million in notional amount of interest rate swaps, would increase or decrease by 11.6 million. 
 If market rates decline relative to interest rates on the ANGI Group Senior Notes, the Company runs the risk that the related required interest payments will exceed those based on market rates. A 100-basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by 17.5 million. Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period, nor changes in the credit profile.

 PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Overview 
 In the ordinary course of business, IAC and its subsidiaries may become parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property and other claims, as well as stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. The litigation matter described below involves issues or claims that may be of particular interest to IAC's stockholders, regardless of whether such matter may be material to IAC's financial position or operations based upon the standard set forth in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Shareholder Litigation Arising Out of the Match Separation 
 This shareholder class action pending in Delaware state court is described in detail under the captions Part I-Item 3-Legal Proceedings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (pages 34-35). See In re Match Group, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, No. 2020-0505 (Delaware Chancery Court). This lawsuit alleges that the terms of the Match Separation (as defined on page 32 of this quarterly report) are unfair to the former Match Group, Inc. public shareholders and unduly beneficial to IAC as a result of undue influence by IAC and Mr. Diller over the then Match Group, Inc. directors who unanimously approved the transaction and asserts a variety of claims. As previously reported, the Delaware Chancery Court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the action in September 2022, and the plaintiffs appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court. Following oral argument on the plaintiffs appeal, in May 2023, the Delaware Supreme Court issued an order directing the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the correct legal standard governing judicial review of the Match Separation, namely whether review under the more deferential business-judgment rule is triggered when such a transaction has been approved by either a committee of independent directors or a majority vote of the minority stockholders. Supplemental briefing was completed in September 2023 and the court heard further oral argument from the parties in December 2023. 
 
 On April 4, 2024, the Delaware Supreme Court issued its decision, holding that: (i) in order to be subject to review under the more deferential business-judgment rule, rather than entire fairness review, the Match Separation transaction must have been approved by both a committee of independent directors and a majority vote of the Match Group, Inc. minority shareholders, (ii) the Chancery Court correctly ruled that the plaintiffs had pleaded sufficient facts to call into question the independence of one of the three members of the special committee that had negotiated and approved the transaction, (iii) the Chancery Court had incorrectly ruled that the plaintiffs had nevertheless failed to call into question the independence of the special committee as a whole, because all members of the committee must be independent in order for the committee as a whole to be independent, and (iv) the Chancery Court had correctly dismissed the plaintiffs derivative claims for lack of standing, leaving only their direct claims for adjudication. The Delaware Supreme Court remanded the case to the Chancery Court for further proceedings. 
 
 On October 2, 2024, the Chancery Court issued an order: (i) granting Mr. Diller s motion to dismiss the claims asserted against him individually and (ii) denying the motion to dismiss filed by five individual defendants who, at the time of the approval of the Match Separation by Match Group, Inc.'s board of directors, were both Match Group, Inc. directors and officers or directors of IAC. The case is currently in discovery. IAC remains confident in its ability to prevail on the merits and will continue to defend vigorously against the allegations in this litigation.
