Forward-Looking Statements 
 The discussion in this Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 26, 2024 (the Quarterly Report ), including under Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part I and Item 1A, Risk Factors of Part II, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, seeks, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, budget, potential, or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections regarding the Company s business, the economy, and other future conditions, including the impact of natural disasters on sales. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future events, results, performance, or achievements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report, including, without limitation, those factors described in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part I of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A, Risk Factors of Part II of this Quarterly Report, and elsewhere in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include the following: 
 an overall decline in the health of the economy, the hard surface flooring industry, consumer confidence and discretionary spending, and the housing market, including as a result of persistently high or rising inflation or interest rates; 
 our failure to successfully manage the challenges that our planned new store growth poses or the impact of unexpected difficulties or higher costs during our expansion; 
 our inability to enter into leases for additional stores on acceptable terms or renew or replace our current store leases; 
 our failure to successfully anticipate and manage trends, consumer preferences, and demand; 
 our inability to successfully manage increased competition; 
 our inability to manage our inventory, including the impact of inventory obsolescence, shrinkage, and damage; 
 political and regulatory conditions that contribute to uncertainty and market volatility, including the upcoming U.S. presidential election and legislative, regulatory, trade and policies associated with a new administration; 
 any disruption in our distribution capabilities, supply chain, and our related planning and control processes, including carrier capacity constraints, port congestion or shut down, transportation costs, and other supply chain costs or product shortages; 
 any increases in wholesale prices of products, materials, and transportation costs beyond our control, including increases in costs due to inflation; 
 the resignation, incapacitation, or death of any key personnel, including our executive officers; 
 our inability to attract, hire, train, and retain highly qualified managers and staff; 
 the impact of any labor activities; 
 our dependence on foreign imports for the products we sell, including risks associated with obtaining products from abroad; 
 geopolitical risks, such as the conflict in the Middle East, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, such as import restrictions under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, or any antidumping and countervailing duties, any of which could impact our ability to import from foreign suppliers or raise our costs; 
 our ability to manage our comparable store sales; 
 3 

Table of Contents 

any failure by any of our suppliers to supply us with quality products on attractive terms and prices or to adhere to the quality standards that we set for our products; 
 our inability to locate sufficient suitable natural products; 
 the effects of weather conditions, natural disasters, or other unexpected events, including public health crises, that may disrupt our operations; 
 our inability to maintain sufficient levels of cash flow or liquidity to fund our expanding business and service our existing indebtedness; 
 restrictions imposed by our indebtedness on our current and future operations, including risks related to our variable rate debt; 
 any allegations, investigations, lawsuits, or violations of laws and regulations applicable to us, our products or our suppliers; 
 our inability to adequately protect the privacy and security of information related to our customers, us, our associates, our suppliers, and other third parties; 
 any material disruption in our information systems, including our website; 
 new or changing laws or regulations, including tax laws and trade policies and regulations; 
 any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or disputes regarding our intellectual property or the intellectual property of third parties; 
 the impact of any future strategic transactions; and 
 our ability to manage risks related to corporate social responsibility. 
 Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report speak only as of the date hereof. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. If a change to the events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements occurs, our business, financial condition, and operating results may vary materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise.

Refer to Note 8, Fair Value Measurements for additional details related to the Company s interest rate cap agreements. 
 Term Loan Facility 
 The Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate equal to either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the Prime Rate, (2) the U.S. federal funds rate plus and (3) the one-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus , or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR, plus, in each case, the Applicable Margin (each term as defined in the Term Loan Facility credit agreement). The Applicable Margin for base rate loans will be between and , and the Applicable Margin for SOFR loans will be between and (subject to a floor of ), in each case, if the Company exceeds certain leverage ratio tests. 
 All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are secured by (1) a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the property and assets of Outlets and the other guarantors under the Term Loan Facility, with certain exceptions, and (2) a second-priority security interest in the collateral securing the ABL Facility.

million with actual available borrowings limited to the sum, at the time of calculation, of (a) eligible credit card receivables multiplied by the credit card advance rate, plus (b) the cost of eligible inventory, net of inventory reserves, multiplied by the applicable appraisal percentage, plus (c) of eligible net trade receivables, plus (d) all eligible cash on hand, plus (e) of the amount for which any eligible letter of credit must be honored after giving effect to any draws, minus certain Availability Reserves (each component as defined in the ABL Facility). The ABL Facility is available for issuance of letters of credit and contains a sublimit of million for standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit combined. Available borrowings under the facility are reduced by the face amount of outstanding letters of credit. The Company s ABL Facility allows for the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility by an additional amount up to million. 
 All obligations under the ABL Facility are secured by (1) a first-priority security interest in the cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and related assets of Outlets and the other guarantors under the ABL Facility, with certain exceptions, and (2) a second-priority security interest in substantially all of the other property and assets of Outlets and the other guarantors under the Term Loan Facility. 
 Based on financial data as of September 26, 2024, net availability under the ABL Facility was million as reduced by letters of credit of million. 
 Covenants 
 The credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility contain customary restrictive covenants, which, among other things and with certain exceptions, limit the Company s ability to (i) incur additional indebtedness and liens in connection with such indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments, (iii) effect mergers or consolidations, (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates, (v) sell or dispose of property or assets, and (vi) engage in unrelated lines of business. In addition, these credit agreements subject the Company to certain reporting obligations and require that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants, including, among other things, a requirement that if borrowings under the ABL Facility exceed of availability, the Company will maintain a certain fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as Consolidated EBITDA less non-financed capital expenditures and income taxes paid to consolidated fixed charges, in each case as more fully defined in the ABL Facility). 
 The Term Loan Facility has no financial maintenance covenants. The Company is currently in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreements. 
 Fair Value of Debt 
 Market risk associated with the Company s long-term debt relates to the potential change in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from a change in interest rates. The aggregate fair value of debt is based primarily on the Company s estimates of interest rates, maturities, credit risk, and underlying collateral. 
 
 The Term Loan Facility fair value is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs significant to the valuation, including indicative pricing from counterparties and discounted cash flow methods. amounts were outstanding under the ABL Facility as of September 26, 2024 and December 28, 2023.

 and for the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023, respectively, and and for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023, respectively. For the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024, the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to state income taxes that were partially offset by tax deductions in excess of book expense related to stock-based compensation awards. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024, the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to tax deductions in excess of book expense related to stock-based compensation awards. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2023, the effective income tax rates were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to state income taxes that were partially offset by tax deductions in excess of book expense related to stock-based compensation awards.

 - years. The majority of the Company s leases also include options to extend, which are factored into the recognition of their respective assets and liabilities when appropriate based on management s assessment of the probability that the options will be exercised. 
 When readily determinable, the rate implicit in the lease is used to discount lease payments to present value; however, substantially all of the Company s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses a third party to assist in the determination of a secured incremental borrowing rate, determined on a collateralized basis, to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The secured incremental borrowing rate is estimated based on yields obtained from Bloomberg for U.S. consumers with a BB credit rating and is adjusted for collateralization as well as inflation. As of September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023, the Company s weighted average discount rate was and , respectively. As of both September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term of the Company s leases was approximately years.

million for property damage, personal injury, and wrongful death. The petition also seeks exemplary damages. Plaintiff s ex-husband, brother, and the additional occupant have since intervened as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Intervenors allege the same claims against the Company and the Bestview entities and collectively seek damages in excess of million for property damage, personal injury (as to the other occupant), wrongful death, and exemplary damages. The Company has answered all petitions, denying the allegations. The case is currently set for trial in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 The Company maintains insurance that may cover any liability arising out of the above-referenced litigation up to the policy limits and subject to meeting certain deductibles and to other terms and conditions thereof. Estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been resolved. For these reasons, the Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses resulting from the above-referenced litigation. 
 On June 18, 2020, an alleged stockholder filed a putative derivative complaint, Lincolnshire Police Pension Fund v. Taylor, et al., No. 2020-0487-JTL, in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s officers, directors, and stockholders. An amended complaint was filed on September 14, 2022. The Company along with the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 31, 2022. The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint on December 22, 2022. On February 6, 2023, the Company, along with the other defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. On December 5, 2023, the Court denied the defendants motion to dismiss, and the case proceeded to discovery. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment. The factual allegations underlying these claims are similar to the factual allegations made in the previously dismissed In re Floor Decor Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation, as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and restitution for the Company from the individual defendants and the payment of costs and attorneys fees. On September 17, 2024, the defendants entered into a Stipulation of Compromise and Settlement (the Stipulation with the plaintiffs, which was filed with the Court on September 17, 2024, setting forth the terms and conditions of a proposed settlement. The settlement provides, among other things, for a full release of the claims that the plaintiffs or any other Company stockholder asserted or could have asserted in the litigation against any of the defendants in exchange for (1) an million payment to the Company, net of payment of the fees and expenses of plaintiffs counsel, and (2) the Company s agreement to implement and/or maintain certain corporate governance measures, as more fully described in the Stipulation. The settlement is subject to Court approval, the Court hearing for which is scheduled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The settlement, if finally approved, will cause the dismissal with prejudice of this litigation. 
 The Company is also subject to various other legal actions, claims, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, which may include claims related to general liability, workers compensation, product liability, intellectual property, and employment-related matters resulting from its business activities. As with most actions such as these, an estimation of any possible and/or ultimate liability cannot always be determined. The Company establishes reserves for specific legal proceedings when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. These various other ordinary course proceedings are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, however, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

 The Company periodically grants restricted stock units RSUs that represent an unfunded, unsecured right to receive a share of the Company s Class A common stock upon vesting. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees, executive officers, and non-employee directors comprised of service-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs. Service-based RSUs vest based on the grantee s continued service through the vesting date. The performance-based RSUs cliff vest based on (i) the Company s achievement of predetermined financial metrics at the end of a performance period and (ii) the grantee s continued service through the vesting date. Depending on the extent to which the relevant performance goals are achieved, the number of common shares earned upon vesting may range from to of the award granted. The Company assesses the probability of achieving all performance goals on a quarterly basis. The service period for RSUs granted during the period varies by grantee and is from the grant date for non-employee directors and ranges between two to from the grant date for employees and executive officers.

 Interest Rate Cap Contracts 
 Changes in interest rates impact the Company s results of operations. In an effort to manage exposure to this risk, the Company enters into derivative contracts and may adjust its derivative portfolio as market conditions change. 
 As of September 26, 2024, the Company s outstanding interest rate cap contract was designated as a cash flow hedge. The contract has a notional value of million and effectively caps SOFR-based interest payments on a portion of the Company s Term Loan Facility at beginning in May 2024 and will continue until the agreement expires in April 2026. The Company s interest cap agreements outstanding at December 28, 2023, each with a notional value of million, expired in April 2024. The effective portion of the gain or loss on effective cash flow hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The effective portion of the derivative represents the change in fair value of the hedge that offsets the change in fair value of the hedged item. To the extent the change in the fair value of the hedge does not perfectly offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item, the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings. 
 The Company s outstanding interest rate cap contracts as of September 26, 2024 and December 28, 2023 were valued primarily using Level 2 inputs based on data readily observable in public markets. The Company s interest rate cap contracts were negotiated with counterparties without going through a public exchange. Accordingly, the Company s fair value assessments for these derivative contracts gave consideration to the risk of counterparty default as well as the Company s own credit risk. As of September 26, 2024 and December 28, 2023, the total fair value of the Company s interest rate cap contracts was approximately million and million, respectively, which are presented as a component of AOCI within stockholders equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of tax of million and million, respectively. interest income was reclassified from AOCI into earnings related to the interest rate cap contracts during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 compared to million of interest income reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2023. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023, the Company reclassified million and million, respectively, of interest income from AOCI into earnings related to the interest rate cap contracts.

 Net Sales 
 Net sales during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 increased 10.1 million, or 0.9 , compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to sales from the 34 new warehouse-format stores that we opened since September 28, 2023 and growth in Spartan, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of 6.4 . The comparable store sales decline during the period of 6.4 , or 67.3 million, was due to a 4.1 decrease in comparable transactions and a 2.4 decrease in comparable average ticket. Non-comparable sales of 77.4 million during the same period were primarily driven by new stores and revenue from Spartan. 
 Net sales during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 decreased 17.4 million, or 0.5 , compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales of 9.0 , partially offset by sales from the 34 new warehouse-format stores that we opened since September 28, 2023 and growth in Spartan. The comparable store sales decline during the period of 9.0 , or 291.3 million, was due to a 5.6 decrease in comparable transactions and a 3.7 decrease in comparable average ticket. Non-comparable sales of 273.9 million during the same period were primarily driven by new stores and revenue from Spartan. 
 We believe the decreases in comparable transactions for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 were largely driven by the impact of lower existing home sales. The decreases in comparable average ticket during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024, were primarily due to smaller average transaction sizes. 
 We estimate that retail sales during both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 were approximately 52 from homeowners and 48 from Pros compared to approximately 56 from homeowners and 44 from Pros during both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2023. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 increased 18.4 million, or 3.9 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by an increase in gross margin to 43.5 , up approximately 130 basis points from 42.2 in the same period a year ago. 
 Gross profit during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 increased 30.7 million, or 2.2 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by an increase in gross margin to 43.2 , up approximately 110 basis points from 42.1 in the same period a year ago. 
 The increases in gross margin during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 were primarily driven by a decrease in supply chain costs. 
 Selling and Store Operating Expenses 
 Selling and store operating expenses during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 increased 30.6 million, or 9.9 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase in selling and store operating expenses was primarily driven by 37.3 million for new stores and 1.0 million at Spartan, partially offset by a decrease of 7.7 million at our comparable stores. As a percentage of net sales, selling and store operating expenses increased by approximately 240 basis points to 30.3 from 27.9 in the corresponding prior year period.

Table of Contents 

Selling and store operating expenses during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 increased 91.2 million, or 9.9 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase in selling and store operating expenses was primarily driven by 115.7 million for new stores and 6.3 million at Spartan, partially offset by a decrease of 30.8 million at our comparable stores. As a percentage of net sales, selling and store operating expenses increased by approximately 290 basis points to 30.3 from 27.4 in the corresponding prior year period. 
 The increases in selling and store operating expenses in total and as a percentage of net sales during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 were primarily attributable to deleverage from a decrease in comparable store sales and the addition of new stores. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 increased 7.8 million, or 13.1 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 80 basis points to 6.1 from 5.3 in the corresponding prior year period. 
 General and administrative expenses during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 increased 17.1 million, or 9.2 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 50 basis points to 6.0 from 5.5 in the corresponding prior year period. 
 The increases in general and administrative expenses in total and as a percentage of net sales for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 were primarily driven by incentive compensation of 7.0 million and 9.3 million, respectively, and additional staffing costs to support store growth of approximately 1.6 million and 6.4 million, respectively. 
 Pre-Opening Expenses 
 Pre-opening expenses during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 decreased 1.5 million, or 10.5 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. The decrease in pre-opening expenses during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 primarily resulted from a decrease in the number of future stores that we were preparing to open compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Pre-opening expenses during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 increased 0.7 million, or 2.2 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase in pre-opening expenses during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 primarily resulted from an increase in the number of stores that we opened compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Net interest expense during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 decreased 1.1 million, or 84.8 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Net interest expense during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 decreased 6.2 million, or 68.8 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 The decreases in net interest expense for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 were primarily due to a decrease in average amounts outstanding under our ABL Facility, higher interest income as a result of higher cash balances, and an increase in interest capitalized, partially offset by lower interest income from our interest cap derivative contracts. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 14.4 million during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 compared to 17.6 million during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2023. The effective tax rate was 21.8 for the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 compared to 21.1 in the corresponding prior year period. The effective tax rate increase during the thirteen weeks ended September 26, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. 
 Income tax expense was 35.8 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 compared to 57.4 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2023. The effective tax rate was 18.4 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 compared to 21.5 in the corresponding prior year period. The effective tax rate decrease during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that were partially offset by limitations on deductions for compensation to certain employees under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance and enterprise value. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures, as they eliminate certain expenses that are not indicative of our core operating performance and facilitate a comparison of our core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a basis to determine covenant compliance with respect to our ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility (together, the Credit Facilities ), to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties as performance measures to evaluate companies in our industry. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted to eliminate the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. See below for a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for management s discretionary use. In addition, these non-GAAP measures exclude certain non-recurring and other charges. Each of these non-GAAP measures has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the items eliminated in the adjustments made to determine EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, such as stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments related to contingent earn-out liabilities, and other adjustments. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Definitions and calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differ among companies in the retail industry, and therefore EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies. 
 For the periods presented, the following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP: 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-nine Weeks Ended in thousands September 26, 2024 September 28, 2023 September 26, 2024 September 28, 2023 Net income 51,690 65,923 158,388 208,899 Depreciation and amortization (a) 57,328 50,336 171,044 145,439 Interest expense, net 189 1,246 2,807 9,006 Income tax expense 14,438 17,603 35,761 57,357 EBITDA 123,645 135,108 368,000 420,701 Stock-based compensation expense (b) 10,031 5,289 25,618 20,336 Other (c) (779) 542 (866) 2,329 Adjusted EBITDA 132,897 140,939 392,752 443,366

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is provided primarily by cash flows from operations and our 800.0 million ABL Facility. Unrestricted liquidity based on our September 26, 2024 financial data was 803.1 million, consisting of 180.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and 622.3 million immediately available for borrowing under the ABL Facility without violating any covenants thereunder. 
 Our liquidity is generally not seasonal. Our primary cash needs are for merchandise inventories, payroll, store rent, and other operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with opening new stores and remodeling existing stores as well as information technology, e-commerce, store support center, and distribution center infrastructure. We also use cash for the payment of taxes and interest and, as applicable, acquisitions. We expect that cash generated from operations together with cash on hand, the availability of borrowings under our Credit Facilities, and if necessary, additional funding through other forms of external financing, will be sufficient to meet liquidity requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and payments due under our Credit Facilities for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. 
 Total capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 are planned to be between approximately 360 million to 390 million and are expected to be funded primarily by cash generated from operations and borrowings under the ABL Facility. Our capital needs may change in the future due to changes in our business, new opportunities that we choose to pursue, or other factors. We currently expect the following for capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 (projected amounts are based on the gross costs that we expect to accrue for these investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in fiscal 2024, which may include amounts incurred but not yet settled in cash during the period): 
 invest approximately 265 million to 295 million to open 30 warehouse-format stores, relocate stores, and begin construction on stores opening after fiscal 2024; 
 invest approximately 65 million in existing store remodeling projects and our distribution centers; and 
 invest approximately 30 million in information technology infrastructure, e-commerce, and other store support center initiatives. 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 A summary of our operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table: 
 Thirty-nine Weeks Ended in thousands September 26, 2024 September 28, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 501,768 698,975 Net cash used in investing activities (349,360) (431,070) Net cash used in financing activities 
 (6,019) (216,071) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 
 146,389 51,834 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of (i) net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, and changes in the fair values of contingent earn-out liabilities and (ii) changes in working capital. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023 was 501.8 million and 699.0 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a lower decrease in inventory, lower increase in trade accounts payable, and a decline in cash earnings after adjusting net income for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, which were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes receivable and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Investing activities typically consist primarily of capital expenditures for new store openings and existing store remodels, including leasehold improvements, racking, fixtures, vignettes, design centers, and new infrastructure and information systems. Cash payments to acquire businesses are also included in investing activities.

Table of Contents 

Net cash used in investing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023 was 349.4 million and 431.1 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due to a decrease in capital expenditures and cash paid for an acquisition in 2023. The decline in capital expenditures was driven by the timing of construction payable settlements for recently completed stores and a decrease in new stores under construction compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and related repayments under our credit agreements, tax payments related to the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation awards, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee share purchase program, and payments of contingent earn-out consideration. 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2024 and September 28, 2023 was 6.0 million and 216.1 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in net ABL Facility repayments. 
 Our Credit Facilities 
 As of September 26, 2024, total Term Loan Facility debt was 200.8 million, and no amounts were outstanding under our ABL Facility. For additional information regarding our Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility, including applicable covenants and other details, please refer to Note 3, Debt. 
 Credit Ratings 
 Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. Standard Poor s issuer credit rating of BB with a stable outlook and Moody s issuer credit rating of Ba3 with a stable outlook remain unchanged as of September 26, 2024. These ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital. Negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt. Our credit ratings could be lowered or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In particular, a weakening of our financial condition, including an increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds, result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook, or otherwise increase our cost of borrowing. 
 
 U.S. Tariffs and Global Economy 
 The current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. In particular, the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China has resulted in the U.S. imposing tariffs of 25 on many products from China. While exclusions from tariffs were granted for certain products from China, nearly all of these exclusions have expired. In fiscal 2023, approximately 25 of the products we sold were produced in China. As we continue to manage the impact these tariffs may have on our business, we continue taking steps to mitigate some of these cost increases through negotiating lower costs from our vendors, increasing retail pricing as we deem appropriate, and sourcing from alternative countries. While our efforts have mitigated a substantial portion of the overall effect of increased tariffs, the enacted tariffs have increased our inventory costs and associated cost of sales for the remaining products still sourced from China. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, which describes recent accounting pronouncements adopted by us.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting the Company, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of the Annual Report. While our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 28, 2023, uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of declines in economic conditions that affect the residential housing market and consumer spending for hard surface flooring, inflation, global supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical instability, among others, have introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. See further discussion in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional details. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our Credit Facilities, which have variable interest rates. Based on the 200.8 million total outstanding principal balance of our Credit Facilities as of September 26, 2024, a 1.0 increase in the effective interest rate of this debt would cause an increase in interest expense of approximately 2.0 million over the next twelve months, excluding the impact of our interest rate cap agreement. To lessen our exposure to interest rate risk, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in January 2024 with a notional value of 150.0 million. The interest cap agreement effectively caps SOFR-based interest payments on a portion of the Company s Term Loan Facility at 5.50 beginning in May 2024 and will continue until the agreement expires in April 2026. For additional information related to the Company s Credit Facilities, refer to Note 3, Debt. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, have reviewed the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 26, 2024 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 26, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 The Company has begun a multi-year implementation of portions of our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace our existing core financial and merchandising systems. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next few years. As the phased implementation occurs, it may result in changes to our processes and procedures, which may result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether they materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
