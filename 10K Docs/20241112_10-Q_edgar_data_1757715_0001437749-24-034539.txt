 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 (Unaudited) 

million and generated net cash flows from operations of million. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 , we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million available to fund our operations and an accumulated deficit of million. 
 
 We are required to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants required by the MidCap Credit facility (See Note 7, Credit Facility, Term Loans and Warrants). We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of September 30, 2024 , and expect to remain in compliance through at least September 30, 2025. During February 2024, the Company amended its terms with Midcap Credit Facility extending the term until December 2026 and amending certain financial covenants with favorable terms. We can provide no assurances that we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants. Further, absent of our ability to generate cash inflows from our operations or secure additional outside capital, we will be unable to remain in compliance with these financial covenants. In the event we are unable to remain in compliance with these financial covenants (or other non-financial covenants required by the MidCap Credit Facility), and we are unable to secure a waiver or forbearance, MidCap may, at its discretion, exercise any and all of its existing rights and remedies, which may include, among others, accelerating repayment of the outstanding borrowings and/or asserting its rights in the assets securing the loan. 
 
 As of the issuance date, we have no firm commitments to secure additional outside capital from lenders or investors. While we expect to continue to explore raising additional outside capital, specifically to fund our M A strategy, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain capital or do so on terms that are acceptable to us. Accordingly, absent our ability to generate cash inflows from our operations and/or secure additional outside capital in the near term, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months beyond the issuance date. 
 
 The Company's plan is to continue to closely monitor our operating forecast, to pursue our M A strategy, to pursue additional sources of outside capital on terms that are acceptable to us, and to secure a waiver or forbearance from MidCap if we are unable to remain in compliance with one or more of the covenants required by the MidCap Credit Facility. Further, the Company has enacted a strategy to reduce the number of SKUs it sells and will no longer be pursuing future sales of SKUs that are either not profitable or not core to the Company s strategy. If some or all of our plans prove unsuccessful, we may need to implement short-term changes to our operating plan, including but not limited to delaying expenditures, reducing investments in new products, or reducing our sale and distribution infrastructure. We may also need to seek long-term strategic alternatives, such as a significant curtailment of our operations, a sale of certain of our assets, a divestiture of certain product lines, a sale of the entire enterprise to strategic or financial investors, and/or allow our enterprise to become insolvent. 
 
 The Company has completed two restructuring programs over the last 18 months to reduce operating costs and right size the workforce to align with the scale of our streamlined operations. In addition, we have reduced the SKU count to solely focus on profitable products that are core to the Company s strategy. During February 2024, we extended the term with Midcap Credit Facility until December 2026 See Note 7, Credit Facility, Term Loans and Warrants) and amended key terms which will add more flexibility to liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet. In consideration of these factors, the Company will monitor profitability and cash flow over the next several quarters to evaluate our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Although significant strides have been made in reducing our operating losses and strengthening our balance sheet, uncertainties persist in our business operations and the forecasting of our business. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
 
 Nasdaq Listing - On April 24, 2023, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company is currently in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550 (a)( 2 (the Bid Price Notice ). The Bid Price Notice provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Bid Price Notice, or until October 23, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid requirement, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810 (c)( 3 )(A). Following a request we made on October 13, 2023, on October 24, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq granting the Company an additional 180 days, or until April 22, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid requirement (the Extension Notice ). 
 
 Nasdaq notified the Company in the Compliance Notice that from March 22, 2024 to April 5, 2024 the closing bid price of the Company s common stock had been 1.00 per share or greater and, accordingly, the Company had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450 (a)( 1 and that the matter was now closed. 
 
 On August 11, 2023, Aterian's shareholders approved discretionary authority to our Board to (A) amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect one or more consolidations of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value per share, pursuant to which the shares of Common Stock would be combined and reclassified at ratios within the range from 1 -for- up to 1 -for- and (B) determine whether to arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by stockholders entitled thereto, to pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share of Common Stock as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, or to entitle stockholders to receive from our transfer agent, in lieu of any fractional share, the number of shares of Common Stock rounded up to the next whole number, and to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in connection therewith. 
 
 On March 20, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with the Secretary of State of Delaware (the Certificate of Amendment to effect a 1 -for- reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of the shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the Common Stock ). The Certificate of Amendment did not decrease the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or change the par value thereof. fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Stock Split impacted all holders of the Common Stock proportionally and did not impact any stockholder s percentage ownership of Common Stock (except to the extent the Reverse Stock Split results in any stockholder owning fractional shares). 
 
 The Common Stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq on March 22, 2024. All share and per share data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 
 
 Restructuring - On May 9, 2023, the Company announced a plan to reduce expenses by implementing a reduction in its current workforce impacting approximately employees and contractors, primarily in the Philippines. The Company recognized restructuring charges of million for the year-ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 On February 8, 2024, the Company committed to a fixed cost-cutting plan, including a reduction in workforce which resulted in the termination of approximately employees and contractors globally. The Company recognized restructuring charges (reversals) of ) thousand and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. 

million related to its Chinese subsidiary within Other Non-current Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and million related to a letter of credit within "Prepaid and Other Current Assets" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has classified the following as restricted cash: million related to its Chinese subsidiary within Other Non-current Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, million related to a letter of credit and million for cash sweeps account related to the Midcap Credit Facility within "Prepaid and Other Current Assets" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 million at December 31, 2023 and million at September 30, 2024 , which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and represents the expected value of the refund that will be due to its customers. 
 
 The Company evaluated principal versus agent considerations to determine whether it is appropriate to record platform fees paid to Amazon as an expense or as a reduction of revenue. Platform fees are recorded as sales and distribution expenses and are not recorded as a reduction of revenue because the Company owns and controls all the goods before they are transferred to the customer. The Company can, at any time, direct Amazon, or similarly direct other third -party logistics providers Logistics Providers ), to return the Company s inventory to any location specified by the Company. It is the Company s responsibility to make customers whole following any returns made by customers directly to Logistic Providers and the Company retains the back-end inventory risk. Further, the Company is subject to credit risk (i.e., credit card charge backs), establishes prices of its products, can determine who fulfills the goods to the customer (Amazon or the Company) and can limit quantities or stop selling the goods at any time. Based on these considerations, the Company is the principal in this arrangement.

million during the three months ending March 31, 2023 within impairment loss on intangibles on the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a substantial decrease in its market capitalization, primarily relating to a decrease in share price. Further, the Company continued to see reduced net revenues across its portfolio due primarily to the then current macroeconomic environment reducing demand for consumer discretionary goods. Finally, during the three months ending June 30, 2023, the Company implemented a strategy of rationalizing certain less profitable products and reducing its product offering, specifically related to its kitchen appliance products. As a result of this rationalization, along with the reduced demand for its products, the Company made certain revisions to its internal forecasts for its Paper business and Kitchen appliance business. The Company concluded that these factors were an interim triggering event for the three months ending June 30, 2023 indicating the carrying value of our Paper and Kitchen appliance business s long-lived assets, including trademarks, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test of the trademark and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value of an asset group to the net undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated. The recoverability test indicated that certain definite-live trademark intangible assets were impaired. The Company concluded the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows which resulted in an impairment charge. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of million for the Paper business and Kitchen appliance business during the three months ending June 30, 2023 within impairment loss on intangibles on the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company continued to see reduced revenue in its paper business resulting in certain revisions to its internal forecasts. Due to these revisions in forecast due to reduced demand, the Company concluded this was an interim triggering event for the three months ending December 31, 2023 indicating the carrying value of our Paper business s long-lived assets, including trademarks, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test of the trademark and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value of an asset group to the net undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated. The recoverability test indicated that certain definite-live trademark intangible assets were impaired. The Company concluded the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows which resulted in an impairment charge. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of million for the Paper business during the three months ending December 31, 2023 within impairment loss on intangibles on the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 These fair value measurements require significant judgements using Level 3 inputs, such as discounted projected future cash flows, which are not observable from the market, directly or indirectly. There is uncertainty in the projected future cash flows used in the Company s impairment analysis, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. If actual performance does not achieve the projections, or if the assumptions used in the analysis change in the future, the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods. Key assumptions in the impairment models included a discount and royalty rate. The Company believes our procedures for determining fair value are reasonable and consistent with current market conditions as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 There were no triggering events to test intangibles for impairment loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 We will continue to closely monitor actual results versus expectations as well as whether and to what extent any significant changes in current events or conditions result in corresponding changes to our expectations about future estimated cash flows. If our adjusted expectations of the operating results do not materialize, we may be required to record intangible impairment charges, which may be material.

 Upon the issuance of the Prefunded Warrants and stock purchase warrants, the Company evaluated the terms of each Warrant to determine the appropriate accounting and classification pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815. Based on the Company s evaluation and due to certain terms in the warrant agreements, it concluded the Prefunded Warrant and the stock purchase warrants should be classified as liabilities with subsequent remeasurement at each quarter so long as such warrants remain to be classified as liabilities. The Company recorded an initial liability on issuance of million from this conclusion. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has million as the liability related to the Warrants.

 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan 
 
 On May 27, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee adopted the Aterian, Inc. 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan ). The Inducement Plan will serve to advance the interests of the Company by providing a material inducement for the best available individuals to join the Company as employees by affording such individuals an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. 
 
 The Inducement Plan provides for the grant of equity-based awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares solely to prospective employees of the Company or an affiliate of the Company provided that certain criteria are met. Awards under the Inducement Plan may only be granted to an individual, as a material inducement to such individual to enter into employment with the Company or an affiliate of the Company, who (i) has not previously been an employee or director of the Company or (ii) is rehired following a bona fide period of non-employment with the Company. The maximum number of shares available for grant under the Inducement Plan is shares of the Company s common stock (subject to adjustment for recapitalizations, stock splits, reorganizations and similar transactions). The Inducement Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee and expires ten years from the date of effectiveness. As of September 30, 2024 , shares were reserved for future issuance under the Inducement Plan.

 Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On March 20, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with the Secretary of State of Delaware (the Certificate of Amendment to effect a 1 -for- reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of the shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the Common Stock ). The Certificate of Amendment did not decrease the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or change the par value thereof. fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Stock Split impacted all holders of the Common Stock proportionally and did not impact any stockholder s percentage ownership of Common Stock (except to the extent the Reverse Stock Split results in any stockholder owning fractional shares). 
 
 The reverse stock split is deemed an equity restructuring pursuant to ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The Company's equity plans incorporate anti-dilutive provisions for existing equity awards, including restricted stock and stock options, to maintain the value of all awards post-reverse stock split. Consequently, there were no change in the fair value of the awards attributable to the reverse stock split, and no impact on stock-based compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The Common Stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq on March 22, 2024. All share and per share data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.

1 On March 20, 2023, the Company made certain leadership changes in our essential oil business resulting in a change in strategy and outlook for the business which resulted in a reduced portfolio offering. This reduction in the portfolio will be impactful to our essential oil business's future revenues and profitability and as a result the Company made revisions to our internal forecasts. The Company concluded that this change was an interim triggering event for the three months ending March 31, 2023 indicating the carrying value of our essential oil business's long-lived assets including trademarks may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test of the trademark and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value of an asset group to the net undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated. The recoverability test indicated that certain definite-live trademark intangible assets were impaired. The Company concluded the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows which resulted in an impairment charge. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of million in the three months ending March 31, 2023 within impairment loss on intangibles on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company had a substantial decrease in its market capitalization, primarily relating to a decrease in share price. Further, the Company continues to see reduced net revenues across its portfolio primarily due to the current macroeconomic environment reducing demand for consumer goods. Finally, during the three months ending September 30, 2023 , the Company implemented a strategy of rationalizing certain less profitable products and reducing its product offering, specifically related to its kitchen appliance products. As a result of this rationalization, along with the reduced demand for its products, the Company has made certain revisions to its internal forecasts for its Paper business and Kitchen appliance business. The Company concluded that these factors were an interim triggering event for the three months ending September 30, 2023 indicating the carrying value of our Paper and Kitchen appliance business s long-lived assets, including trademarks, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test of the trademark and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value of an asset group to the net undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated. The recoverability test indicated that certain definite-live trademark intangible assets were impaired. The Company concluded the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows which resulted in an impairment charge. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of million for the Paper business and Kitchen appliance business during the three months ending September 30, 2023 within impairment loss on intangibles on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 19, 2024. As discussed in the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements , the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified in the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors under Part II, Item 1A in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Overview 
 
 We are a technology-enabled consumer products company that predominantly operates through online retail channels such as Amazon and Walmart. The Company operates its owned brands, which were either incubated or purchased, selling products in multiple categories, including home and kitchen appliances, kitchenware, air quality appliances, health and beauty products and essential oils. 
 
 Our primary brands include Squatty Potty, HomeLabs, Mueller Living, PurSteam, Healing Solutions, and Photo Paper Direct ("PPD"). We generate revenue primarily through the online sales of our various consumer products with substantially all of our sales being made through the Amazon U.S. marketplace. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company enacted a strategy to reduce the number of SKUs it sells and is no longer pursuing future sales of SKUs that are either not profitable or not core to the Company s strategy. 
 
 Seasonality of Business and Product Mix 
 
 Our individual product categories are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of the summer season for certain of our environmental appliance products and the fall and holiday season for our small kitchen appliances and accessories. With our current mix of environmental appliances, the sales of those products tend to be significantly higher in the summer season. Further, our essential oils, small kitchen appliances and accessories tend to have higher sales during the fourth quarter, which includes Thanksgiving and the December holiday season. As a result, our operational results, cash flows, cash and inventory positions may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in our product mix. 
 
 Product mix can affect our gross profit and the variable portion of our sales and distribution expenses. We rely heavily on a global supply chain in which the cost, lead times, and delays, as well as global and geopolitical events can ultimately have a direct impact to our margins. Further, impacts on our supply chain may force us to hold more inventory, which not only affects working capital but also requires us to increase our storage capacity, through our warehouse network, which of itself has a capital impact. 
 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 
 Net Revenue We derive our revenue from the sale of consumer products, primarily in the U.S. We sell products directly to consumers through online retail channels and through wholesale channels. Direct-to-consumer sales (i.e., direct net revenue), which is currently the majority of our revenue, is done through various online retail channels. We sell on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and our own websites, with substantially all of our sales made through Amazon.com. For all of our sales and distribution channels, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when our performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at the shipment date. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold consists of the book value of inventory sold to customers during the reporting period. Book value of inventory includes the amounts we pay manufacturers for product, tariffs and duties associated with transporting product across national borders, and freight costs associated with transporting the product from our manufacturers to our warehouses, as applicable. Shrinkage costs are also recognized within the cost of goods sold. When circumstances dictate that we use net realizable value as the basis for recording inventory, we base our estimates on expected future selling prices, less expected disposal costs. 
 
 Expenses: 
 
 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses include compensation and employee benefits for technology development employees, travel-related costs and fees paid to outside consultants related to the development of our intellectual property. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company shifted its technology platform away from a fully internally developed model to an integrated third party model. Therefore, beginning with the three months ending March 31, 2024, technology and employee related costs have been presented in general and administrative costs on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 Sales and Distribution Expenses Sales and distribution expenses consist of online advertising costs, marketing and promotional costs, sales and ecommerce platform commissions, fulfillment, including shipping and handling, and warehouse costs (i.e., sales and distribution variable expenses). Sales and distribution expenses also include employee compensation and benefits and other related fixed costs. Shipping and handling expenses are included in our consolidated statements of operations in sales and distribution expenses. This includes inbound, pick and pack costs and outbound transportation costs to ship goods to customers performed by e-commerce platforms or incurred directly by us, through our own direct fulfillment platform, which leverages our technology platform and third-party logistics partners. Our sales and distribution expenses, specifically our logistics expenses and online advertising, will vary quarter to quarter as they are dependent on our sales volume, our product mix and whether we fulfill products ourselves, i.e., fulfillment by merchant FBM ), or through e-commerce platform service providers, i.e., fulfillment by Amazon FBA or fulfilled by Walmart WFS ). Products with less expensive fulfillment costs as a percentage of net revenue may allow for a lower gross margin, while still maintaining their targeted profitability level. Conversely, products with higher fulfillment costs will need to achieve a higher gross margin to maintain their targeted level of profitability. We are FBM One Day and Two Day Prime certified, allowing us to deliver our sales through Amazon to most customers within one or two days. We periodically review the locations and capacity of our third-party warehouses to ensure we have the appropriate geographic reach, which helps to reduce the average last mile shipping zones to the end customer and as such our speed of delivery improves while our shipping costs to customers decrease, prior to the impacts on shipping providers rates. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include compensation and employee benefits for executive management, finance administration, legal, and human resources, facility costs, insurance, travel, professional service fees and other general overhead costs, including the costs of being a public company. Beginning with the three months ending March 31, 2024, technology and employee related costs have been presented in general and administrative costs. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net includes the interest cost from our credit facility and term loans, and includes amortization of deferred finance costs and debt discounts from our credit facility (the Credit Facility with MidCap Funding IV Trust MidCap ).

Every category of business had a reduction in sales compared to the prior year primarily relating to the SKU rationalization that took place during the year-ended December 31, 2023 and softness in consumer demand due the macroeconomic environment. In addition, there were competitive pricing pressures coupled with certain key products losing their prominent positioning on Amazon due to competition, specifically in the kitchen appliance businesses. These factors resulted in a reduction of units sold compared to the prior year period.

 Gross profit increased from 49.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 60.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Our sales and distribution fixed costs (e.g., salary and office expenses) including stock-based compensation was relatively flat at 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This is primarily attributable to a decrease in headcount expense of 0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in expenses related to a new Amazon Seller Program of 0.2 million, an increase in professional fees of 0.1 million and an increase in stock compensation expenses of 0.1 million.

Liquidity and Going Concern 
 
 As an emerging growth company, we are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our enterprise. In this regard, substantially all of our efforts to date have been devoted to the development and sale of our products in the marketplace, which includes our investment in organic growth at the expense of short-term profitably, our investment in incremental growth through mergers acquisitions M A strategy ), our recruitment of management and technical staff, and raising capital to fund the development of our enterprise. As a result of these efforts, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and expect to continue to incur such losses, at a reduced level, and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future until such time that we reach a scale of profitability to sustain our operations. We have also experienced declining revenues due to macroeconomic factors, including increased interest rates and reduced consumer discretionary spending, and other factors, and we are focusing our efforts on a more limited number of products. In addition, our recent financial performance has been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures and reduced consumer spending. 
 
 In order to execute our growth strategy, we have historically relied on outside capital through the issuance of equity, debt, and borrowings under financing arrangements (collectively outside capital to fund our cost structure, and we expect to continue to rely on outside capital for the foreseeable future, specifically for our M A strategy. While we believe we will eventually reach a level of profitability to sustain our operations, there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve such profitability or do so in a manner that does not require our continued reliance on outside capital. Moreover, while we have historically been successful in raising outside capital, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to obtain outside capital in the future or do so on terms that are acceptable to us. 
 
 As of the date the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were issued (the issuance date ), we evaluated the significance of the following adverse financial conditions in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 205-40, Going Concern: 
 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and used cash flows from operations to fund our enterprise. In this regard, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 10.6 million and generated net cash flows from operations of 2.2 million. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 16.1 million available to fund our operations and an accumulated deficit of 710.4 million. 
 
 We are required to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants required by the MidCap Credit facility (See Note 7, Credit Facility, Term Loans and Warrants). We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of September 30, 2024, and expect to remain in compliance through at least September 30, 2025. During February 2024, the Company amended its terms with Midcap Credit Facility extending the term until December 2026 and amending certain financial covenants with favorable terms. We can provide no assurances that we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants. Further, absent of our ability to generate cash inflows from our operations or secure additional outside capital, we will be unable to remain in compliance with these financial covenants. In the event we are unable to remain in compliance with these financial covenants (or other non-financial covenants required by the MidCap Credit Facility), and we are unable to secure a waiver or forbearance, MidCap may, at its discretion, exercise any and all of its existing rights and remedies, which may include, among others, accelerating repayment of the outstanding borrowings and/or asserting its rights in the assets securing the loan. 
 
 As of the issuance date, we have no firm commitments to secure additional outside capital from lenders or investors. While we expect to continue to explore raising additional outside capital, specifically to fund our M A strategy, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain capital or do so on terms that are acceptable to us. Accordingly, absent our ability to generate cash inflows from our operations and/or secure additional outside capital in the near term, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months beyond the issuance date. 
 
 The Company's plan is to continue to closely monitor our operating forecast, to pursue our M A strategy, to pursue additional sources of outside capital on terms that are acceptable to us, and to secure a waiver or forbearance from MidCap if we are unable to remain in compliance with one or more of the covenants required by the MidCap Credit Facility. Further, the Company has enacted a strategy to reduce the number of SKUs it sells and will no longer be pursuing future sales of SKUs that are either not profitable or not core to the Company s strategy. If some or all of our plans prove unsuccessful, we may need to implement short-term changes to our operating plan, including but not limited to delaying expenditures, reducing investments in new products, or reducing our sale and distribution infrastructure. We may also need to seek long-term strategic alternatives, such as a significant curtailment of our operations, a sale of certain of our assets, a divestiture of certain product lines, a sale of the entire enterprise to strategic or financial investors, and/or allow our enterprise to become insolvent. 
 
 The Company has completed two restructuring programs over the last 18 months to reduce operating costs and right size the workforce to align with the scale of our streamlined operations. In addition, we have reduced the SKU count to solely focus on profitable products that are core to the Company s strategy. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we extended the term with Midcap Credit Facility until December 2026 (See Note 7, Credit Facility, Term Loans and Warrants) and amended key terms which will add more flexibility to liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet. In consideration of these factors, the Company will monitor profitability and cash flow over the next several quarters to evaluate our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Although significant strides have been made in reducing our operating losses and strengthening our balance sheet, uncertainties persist in our business operations and the forecasting of our business. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
 
 Nasdaq Listing - On April 24, 2023, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company is currently in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Notice ). The Bid Price Notice provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Bid Price Notice, or until October 23, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid requirement, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). Following a request we made on October 13, 2023, on October 24, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq granting the Company an additional 180 days, or until April 22, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid requirement (the Extension Notice ). 
 
 Nasdaq notified the Company in the Compliance Notice that from March 22, 2024 to April 5, 2024 the closing bid price of the Company s common stock had been 1.00 per share or greater and, accordingly, the Company had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) and that the matter was now closed. 
 
 On August 11, 2023, Aterian's shareholders approved discretionary authority to our Board to (A) amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect one or more consolidations of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, pursuant to which the shares of Common Stock would be combined and reclassified at ratios within the range from 1-for-2 up to 1-for-30 and (B) determine whether to arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by stockholders entitled thereto, to pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share of Common Stock as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, or to entitle stockholders to receive from our transfer agent, in lieu of any fractional share, the number of shares of Common Stock rounded up to the next whole number, and to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in connection therewith. 
 
 On March 20, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with the Secretary of State of Delaware (the Certificate of Amendment to effect a 1-for-12 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of the shares of the Company s Common Stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock ). The Certificate of Amendment did not decrease the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or change the par value thereof. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Stock Split impacted all holders of the Common Stock proportionally and did not impact any stockholder s percentage ownership of Common Stock (except to the extent the Reverse Stock Split results in any stockholder owning fractional shares). 
 
 The Common Stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq on March 22, 2024. All share and per share data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 
 
 Restructuring - On May 9, 2023, the Company announced a plan to reduce expenses by implementing a reduction in its current workforce impacting approximately 50 employees and 15 contractors, primarily in the Philippines. The Company recognized restructuring charges of 1.6 million for the year-ended December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 On February 8, 2024, the Company committed to a fixed cost-cutting plan, including a reduction in workforce which resulted in the termination of approximately 17 employees and 26 contractors globally. The Company recognized restructuring charges (reversals) of (10) thousand and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a liability of 3 thousand for restructuring costs included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 MidCap Credit Facility On December 22, 2021, we entered into a Credit Facility with MidCap, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the lenders party thereto as lenders (the Lenders agreed to provide a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to 40.0 million subject to a borrowing base consisting of, among other things, inventory and sales receivables (subject to certain reserves), and (ii) we agreed to issue to MidCap Funding XXVII Trust a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 16,667 shares of our common stock, in exchange for the Lenders extending loans and other extensions of credit to us under the Credit Facility. 
 
 Prior to the February 2024 amendment, The Credit Facility contained a financial covenant that required us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of (a) 12.5 million during the period from February 1st through and including May 31st of each calendar year, and (b) 15.0 million at all other times. 
 
 On February 23, 2024, the Company amended its asset backed credit facility with MidCap Financial Trust. The Credit Facility term has been extended to December 2026 and gives Aterian access to 17 million in current commitments which can be increased, subject to certain conditions, to 30.0 million. The Credit Facility extension reduces the minimum liquidity financial covenant from a peak of 15.0 million to 6.8 million of cash on hand and/or availability in the Credit Facility. The extension fee was less than 0.1 million. At our election, we may elect to comply with an alternative financial covenant that would require us to maintain a minimum borrowing availability under the credit facility of 5.0 million at all times. We currently do not anticipate electing the alternative financial covenant over the next twelve months and are in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant as of the date these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were issued. 
 
 The outstanding balance on the MidCap credit facility as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 was 11.1 million and 6.7 million, respectively. The Company had 1.3 million available on the Midcap credit facility as of September 30, 2024. We are in compliance with the financial covenants contained within the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements and the other financial data included in this Quarterly Report have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP ). However, for the reasons discussed below, we have presented certain non-GAAP measures herein. 
 
 We have presented the following non-GAAP measures to assist investors in understanding our core net operating results on an on-going basis: (i) Contribution margin; (ii) Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue; (iii) EBITDA (iv) Adjusted EBITDA; and (v) Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of our core operating results with those of other companies. 
 
 As used herein, Contribution margin represents gross profit less e-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses (included in sales and distribution expenses). As used herein, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue represents Contribution margin divided by net revenue. As used herein, EBITDA represents net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net provision (benefit) for income taxes. As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair-market value of warrant liabilities, impairment on intangibles, restructuring expenses, and other expenses, net. As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Contribution margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to loss from operations or net loss, as determined under GAAP. 
 
 We present Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, as we believe each of these measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to gross profit, provides useful supplemental information for investors. Specifically, Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a Non-GAAP Financial Measure percentage of net revenue are two of our key metrics in running our business. All product decisions made by us, from the approval of launching a new product and to the liquidation of a product at the end of its life cycle, are measured primarily from Contribution margin and/or Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue. Further, we believe these measures provide improved transparency to our stockholders to determine the performance of our products prior to fixed costs as opposed to referencing gross profit alone. 
 
 In the reconciliation to calculate contribution margin, we add e-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses sales and distribution variable expense to gross profit to inform users of our financial statements of what our product profitability is at each period prior to fixed costs (such as sales and distribution expenses such as salaries as well as research and development expenses and general administrative expenses). By excluding these fixed costs, we believe this allows users of our financial statements to understand our products performance and allows them to measure our products performance over time. 
 
 We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue because we believe each of these measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net loss, provide useful supplemental information for investors. We use these measures with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as sales and gross margins, to assess our historical and prospective operating performance, to provide meaningful comparisons of operating performance across periods, to enhance our understanding of our operating performance and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items. 
 
 Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net loss, loss from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with GAAP. Neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue may not be comparable to similar titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue in the same manner as we do. Our presentation of Contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from such terms or by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 
 We recognize that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue, have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflects: 
 
 our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or mergers and acquisitions; 
 
 the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments, associated with indebtedness; 
 
 depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, or any cash requirements for the replacement of assets; 
 
 changes in cash requirements for our working capital needs; or 
 
 changes warrant liabilities 
 
 Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is and is expected to remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package. 
 
 We also recognize that Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, Contribution margin does not reflect: 
 
 general and administrative expense necessary to operate our business; research and development expenses necessary for the development, operation and support of our software platform; 
 
 the fixed costs portion of our sales and distribution expenses including stock-based compensation expense; or 
 
 warrant liabilities

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 
 As discussed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those consolidated financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition; leases; impairment of intangible assets; impairment of long-lived assets; and income taxes (including uncertain tax positions). There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting policies subsequent to December 31, 2023. 
 
 Intangible asset valuation We review long-lived assets for impairment when performance expectations, events, or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. 
 
 On March 20, 2023, the Company made certain leadership changes in our essential oil business resulting in a change in strategy and outlook for the business which resulted in a reduced portfolio offering. This reduction in the portfolio will be impactful to our essential oil business's future revenues and profitability and as a result the Company made revisions to our internal forecasts. The Company concluded that this change was an interim triggering event for the three months ending March 31, 2023 indicating the carrying value of our essential oil business's long-lived assets including trademarks may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test of the trademark and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value of an asset group to the net undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated. The recoverability test indicated that certain definite-live trademark intangible assets were impaired. The Company concluded the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows which resulted in an impairment charge. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of 16.7 million in the three months ending March 31, 2023 within impairment loss on intangibles on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a substantial decrease in its market capitalization, primarily relating to a decrease in share price. Further, the Company continues to see reduced net revenues across its portfolio due to the current macroeconomic environment reducing demand for consumer goods. Finally, during the three months ending June 30, 2023, the Company implemented a strategy of rationalizing certain less profitable products and reducing its product offering, specifically related to its kitchen appliance products. As a result of this rationalization, along with the reduced demand for its products, the Company has made certain revisions to its internal forecasts for its Paper business and Kitchen appliance business. The Company concluded that these factors were an interim triggering event for the three months ending June 30, 2023 indicating the carrying value of our Paper and Kitchen appliance business s long-lived assets, including trademarks, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test of the trademark and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value of an asset group to the net undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated. The recoverability test indicated that certain definite-live trademark intangible assets were impaired. The Company concluded the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows which resulted in an impairment charge. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of 22.8 million for the Paper business and Kitchen appliance business during the three months ending June 30, 2023 within impairment loss on intangibles on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company continued to see reduced revenue in its Paper business resulting in certain revisions to its internal forecasts. Due to these revisions in forecast due to reduced demand, the Company concluded this was an interim triggering event for the three months ending December 31, 2023 indicating the carrying value of our Paper business s long-lived assets, including trademarks, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test of the trademark and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using Level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value of an asset group to the net undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated. The recoverability test indicated that certain definite-live trademark intangible assets were impaired. The Company concluded the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows which resulted in an impairment charge. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of 0.3 million for the Paper business during the three months ending December 31, 2023 within impairment loss on intangibles on the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 There were no triggering events to test intangibles for impairment loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We will continue to closely monitor actual results versus expectations as well as whether and to what extent any significant changes in current events or conditions result in corresponding changes to our expectations about future estimated cash flows. If our adjusted expectations of the operating results do not materialize, we may be required to record intangible impairment charges, which may be material. 
 
 While we believe our conclusions regarding the estimates of recoverability of our asset groupings are appropriate, these estimates are subject to uncertainty and by nature include judgments and estimates regarding various factors. These factors include the rate and extent of growth in the markets that our asset groups serve, the realization of future sales price and volume increases, fluctuations in exchange rates, fluctuations in price and availability of key raw materials, fluctuations in discount rate, and future operating efficiencies.

 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 From time to time, we are party to various actions and claims arising in the normal course of business. We do not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. In addition, we maintain what we believe is adequate insurance coverage to further mitigate risk. However, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings will not materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 You should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as presented below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Business 
 
 We have historically operated at a loss and we may never achieve or sustain continuous profitability or positive cash flows. Further we and our independent registered public accounting firm have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We have experienced significant after tax losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, our costs have increased historically and may increase further in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results and ability to achieve and sustain long-term ongoing profitability. For example, we may need to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on the ideation, sourcing and development of products, our technology infrastructure, research and development, sales and marketing, international expansion and general administration, including expenses related to being a public company. We have had to rely on a combination of cash flow from operations and new capital in order to sustain our business. Despite the fact that we have raised significant capital, there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve long-term continuous profitability. Even if we do, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Failure to achieve or sustain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Our growth strategy has resulted in operating losses and negative cash flows from operations that raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our former independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the year-ended December 31, 2023, that raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern or maintain our financial covenants with our lenders, we may have to make significant changes to our operating plan, such as delay expenditures, reduce investments in new products, reduce our sale and distribution infrastructure, or significantly reduce our business. Further, if we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. 
 
 A significant majority of our revenue results from sales of products on Amazon s U.S. Marketplace and any change, limitation, or restriction on our ability to operate on Amazon s platform could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 
 A substantial percentage of our revenue is from sales of products on Amazon s U.S. marketplace and we are subject to Amazon s terms of service ToS and various other Amazon seller policies. Amazon has the right to terminate or suspend our ability to sell on its platform at any time and for any reason. Amazon may also take other actions against us such as suspending or terminating our seller accounts or product listings and withholding payments owed to us indefinitely. From time to time in the past, we have experienced such adverse actions for products we have launched and products we have acquired and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to comply with Amazon's ToS. Further, in the event any of our seller accounts or product listings are suspended, or our product listings are required to be changed, for noncompliance or any other reason, including UPC brand mismatches, our reinstatement efforts may take significant time and attention or could fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, Amazon has made, and we expect will continue to make, changes to its platform that could require us to change the manner in which we operate, limit our ability to successfully market existing products and to launch new products or increase our costs to operate. Such changes and the efforts required to maintain compliance therewith could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. Examples of past changes from Amazon have included platform fee increases (i.e., storage, advertising, fulfillment and selling commissions), inventory warehouse limitations, restrictions on certain marketing activities and changes to listing requirements that limit the variations of products that can be included in a single listing. Any change, limitation or restriction on our ability to sell on Amazon s platform, even if temporary, could have a material impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. We also rely on services provided by Amazon s fulfillment platform, including its Prime badge program, in which Amazon guarantees expedited shipping of products we sell to the consumer, an important factor in the consumer s buying decision. Further, Amazon allows us to fulfill from our own third-party warehouses directly to customers under the same Prime badge guarantee. Amazon may at any time decide to discontinue allowing us to fulfill sales of our products directly from our warehouse network or limit our ability to advertise on our product listings that such products will receive expedited shipping under its Prime badge program. Any such inability or limitation, could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We have historically experienced, and may be subject in the future to, Amazon s removal of the Prime badge guarantee from certain of our seller accounts and in those cases we have had limited success having the Prime badge guarantee reinstated in a timely manner or at all. 
 
 Our efforts to grow our business through new products, marketplace and geographic expansion may not be successful and may place a significant strain on our management and operational, financial and other resources. 
 
 Our long-term success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of new products, to expand both to new marketplaces and geographies and to leverage new technologies we may incorporate into our business. We have entered and expect to continue to enter new product categories and both new marketplaces and geographies for which we have limited or no experience. In part we rely on Amazon s global reviews program for success in our international expansion. If that program were to be limited, reduced or discontinued, our international expansion would be negatively affected. We also in part rely on our ability to include new products as variations to existing listings on Amazon. If that strategy were no longer possible for whatever reason, our ability to launch new products could be materially affected. Our efforts to grow our business place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, among other things. We have limited personnel and resources and have reduced headcount significantly in recent years. In order to accomplish our growth goals, our team is required to focus on such growth ventures and reallocate their time and other resources, creating risk in all aspects of our business. We face the risk that we will be unable to disrupt incumbents and that our competitors will introduce new and better products that compete with us. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating results. Any new product that we develop and market may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects, errors, quality or other issues, or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue or may never become profitable. If we are unable to develop and introduce a continuing stream of competitive new products, it may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. Our failure to successfully execute on our growth initiatives can negatively impact our financial results, financial condition, and cash flows.

We may be unsuccessful in making investments, unable to make or unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions or in maintaining or growing the financial performance of any investees or acquired businesses which may adversely affect our business and operating results and could impact the price of our common stock and result in dilution to shareholders. 
 
 Acquisitions and investments are an important aspect of our growth strategy and we expect to continue to pursue brand and other strategic acquisitions and investments. We have acquired a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. Such acquisitions have in the past required, and in the future may require, the attention of management in integrating those businesses including increased attention to managing the supply chain of certain acquisitions. In addition, we have been required to in the past, and may be required to in the future, make significant impairment charges relating to the goodwill and intangible assets of such acquired businesses. The market for acquisitions has historically been highly competitive. Our growth strategy may be adversely affected if we face increased competition for or fail to identify suitable targets. In addition, pursuing or completing any such acquisitions or investments could divert management s attention, and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. Any acquisition or investment, if not favorably received by consumers, shareholders, analysts, and others in the investment community, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, any acquisition involves numerous risks, including: failing to identify problems during due diligence, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges that could cause a target to under-perform post-closing; difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, products, and personnel associated with the acquisition and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; challenges in integrating distribution channels; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; difficulties in transitioning and preserving customer, contractor, supplier, and other important third-party relationships; challenges realizing anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits; the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill; risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited experience; risks associated with subsequent losses including potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire; and problems retaining key personnel. We provide no assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions or that any acquired businesses will experience the same or better level of financial performance as prior to the acquisition. 
 
 In order to complete any future acquisitions, we may need to use our cash on hand, raise additional equity or incur or assume debt, any of which could harm our business. Given the Company s current market capitalization, certain of these options may not be available or only be available on unfavorable terms and could result in significant additional dilution to our stockholders. 
 
 We may be limited by our ability to raise the funding we need to support our growth, including through acquisitions, or to maintain our existing business. Also, such funding may be available only by diluting existing stockholders. 
 
 The success of our business depends in part on our ability to invest significant resources in various aspects of our business including acquisitions and other strategic investments. Our success also depends on our ability to grow through acquisitions. To support our business growth, we will likely require additional funds to maintain and grow our business and to respond to business challenges. Accordingly, from time to time we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, that would result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt we may incur may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. We have in the past and may in the future incur debt that allows us to repay such debt using our common stock, which could result in significant dilution. Further, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all, whether due to issues related to the Company or unrelated to the Company including but not limited to bank failures. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to grow or to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited, and our business could fail or our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to continue to acquire the financing needed in order to pursue future acquisitions or similar transactions or we may not be able to raise sufficient equity or equity-like capital without first seeking stockholder approval, which could limit our ability to complete such financing, or to complete any related transaction on a timely basis or at all. 
 
 U.S. government trade actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operation. 
 
 Over the past several years, the U.S. government has taken a number of trade actions that impact or could impact our operations, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States. As the majority of our products are imported into the United States from China, many of our products are subject to the tariffs imposed under Section 301 of U.S. trade law that have been applied to separate lists of Chinese goods imported into the United States, beginning during the Trump Administration and continuing in the Biden Administration. A number of lawsuits and other legal challenges with respect to the Section 301 tariff actions have been filed and remain pending, which could result in changes to the tariffs. To date, the Biden Administration has effectively maintained and has continued to defend and to enforce these particular trade actions. 
 
 Changes in U.S. trade policy have created ongoing uncertainties in international trade relations, and it is unclear what future actions governments will or will not take with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. During his campaign, President-Elect Trump expressed various intentions to impose tariffs on imports, including 60 tariffs on goods imported from China, 25 tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and between 10 and 20 tariffs on other imports. It is unclear what action the next presidential administration or Congress will take with respect to these proposals. Ongoing or new trade wars or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies could reduce demand for our products and services, increase our costs, reduce our profitability, adversely impact our supply chain or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 We are continually evaluating the impact of the current and any possible new tariffs on our supply chain, costs and sales and are considering strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options, filing requests for exclusion from the tariffs for certain product lines and working with our suppliers. We can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the U.S. government or other countries, as well as the potential for additional trade actions, the impact on our operations and results remains uncertain.

Risks Relating to the Ownership of our Common Stock 
 
 There is no guarantee of a continuing public market for you to resell our common stock. 
 
 There is no guarantee that we will continue to meet all requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We must continue to satisfy Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum closing bid price requirement of 1.00 per share 
 
 On April 24, 2023, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company was not in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (the Bid Price Notice ). The Bid Price Notice provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Bid Price Notice, or until October 23, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid requirement, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). Following a request we made on October 13, 2023, on October 24, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq granting the Company an additional 180 days, or until April 22, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid requirement . On April 8, 2024, Aterian, Inc. (the Company received written notice (the Compliance Notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) which requires that companies listed on Nasdaq maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share. Nasdaq notified the Company in the Compliance Notice that from March 22, 2024 to April 5, 2024 the closing bid price of the Company s common stock had been 1.00 per share or greater and, accordingly, the Company had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) and that the matter was now closed. 
 
 In the future, if our Common Stock falls below the continued listing standard of 1.00 per share or otherwise fails to satisfy any of the Nasdaq continued listing requirements, and if we are unable to cure such deficiency during any subsequent cure period, our Common Stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq. If our Common Stock ultimately were to be delisted for any reason, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

limited availability of market quotations for our Common Stock; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for us; 

a decreased ability for us to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; 

limited liquidity for our stockholders due to thin trading; and 

the potential loss of confidence by investors and employees.

 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
