During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased of marketable securities and investments. Fair Value of Warrants The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants has been estimated using a Black-Scholes model as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants is determined using Level 2 directly or indirectly observable inputs. Inherent in a Black-Scholes model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Material increases (or decreases) in any of those inputs may result in a significantly higher (or lower) fair value measurement. The Company estimates the volatility of its Private Placement Warrants based on implied volatility from the Company s Public Warrants and from historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the Warrants. The dividend yield is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero. The fair value of the Public Warrants has been measured based on the quoted price of such warrants on the Nasdaq Stock Market, a Level 1 input. The following table provides quantitative information regarding Level 2 inputs used in the recurring valuation of the Private Placement Warrants as of their measurement dates: Stock price Volatility Term (in years) Risk-free rate The following table provides a rollforward of the Public Warrants measured at fair value per Public Warrant using Level 1 inputs and Private Placement Warrants measured at fair value per Private Placement Warrant using Level 2 inputs: Change in fair value March 31, 2024 Change in fair value ) ) June 30, 2024 Change in fair value ) ) September 30, 2024 The following tables provides a reconciliation of the change in fair value for the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2024: ) Private Placement Warrants 2 ) Total ) The following tables provides a reconciliation of the change in fair value for the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: ) Private Placement Warrants 2 ) Total )

Overview Solid Power is developing solid-state battery technology for the EV market and additional markets served by battery manufacturers.

Table of Contents 
 Our core technology is a proprietary sulfide solid electrolyte material, which replaces the liquid or gel electrolyte used in traditional lithium-ion batteries. We believe that our electrolyte can improve driving range, battery life, safety performance, and battery costs. Additionally, we are developing solid-state cells with our electrolyte, with the aim of commercializing our technology by selling electrolyte and licensing cell designs. This approach minimizes capital requirements, unlike other battery manufacturers who require significant cell production facilities and equipment. This strategy also allows us to focus on our core strengths of electrolyte production and solid-state technology development. Currently, we produce electrolyte on pilot manufacturing lines. The electrolyte is used for cell development and customer sampling. We also develop cells on two pilot lines, producing multiple cell sizes to both support our partners and refine cell designs. We have partnered with industry leaders BMW, Ford Motor Company, and SK On and will continue to work closely with our partners to improve cell designs, improve our electrolyte, and ultimately commercialize our technology. Our products are currently in the development stage and require further research and improvement before we can commercialize our technology. Recent Business Highlights Selected by the U.S. Department of Energy for up to 50 million award negotiation for continuous production of sulfide-based solid electrolyte materials for advanced all-solid-state batteries. Commenced development activities in our electrolyte innovation center, or EIC, to enhance research and development capabilities and improve pre-pilot electrolyte manufacturing processes. Achieved all milestones and fully received all payments expected in 2024 under the SK On Agreements. Line installation remains on track to be completed in mid-2025, following which validation activities are expected to commence. Continued repeated electrolyte sampling to multiple customers and received constructive feedback, enabling electrolyte improvements. Extended the BMW JDA and will continue to jointly develop cell technologies. 
 Key Factors Affecting Operating Results We are a research and development-stage company and have not generated significant revenue through the sale of our electrolyte or licensing of our cell designs. Our ability to commercialize our products depends on several factors that present significant opportunities but also pose material risks and challenges, including those discussed in the Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, sections of this Report, which are incorporated by reference. Prior to reaching commercialization, we must improve our products to ensure they meet the performance and safety requirements of our customers. We also will have to continue to negotiate licensing and supply contracts with our customers on terms and conditions that are mutually acceptable. To satisfy anticipated demand, we will need to scale production of our electrolyte. All of these will take time and affect our operating results. Since many factors are difficult to quantify, actual operating results may be different than currently anticipated. Revenue generated to date has primarily come from performance on research and development licensing agreements and government contracts. We will need to continue to deploy substantial capital to expand our production capabilities and engage in research and development programs. We also expect to continue to incur significant administrative expenses as a publicly traded company. In addition to meeting our development goals, commercialization and future growth and demand for our products are highly dependent upon consumers adopting EVs. The market for new energy vehicles is still rapidly evolving due to emerging technologies, competitive pricing, government regulation and industry standards, and changing consumer demands and behaviors.

 Basis of Presentation We currently conduct our business through one operating segment. As a research and development company with no commercial operations, our activities to date have been limited and were conducted primarily in the United States. Historical results are reported under GAAP and in U.S. dollars. Results of Operations Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we increased capital and operational investments centered on expanding our electrolyte capabilities and advancing our cell designs. Our capital investments included the addition of an EIC to improve and test electrolyte manufacturing processes. Our operational investments were focused on the strategic enhancement of our research and development workforce as well as efforts to improve electrolyte and cell performance. Through the remainder of 2024, we expect the trend of increased capital and operational investments to continue for our production capabilities, partnership development, and Korean operations as we execute our development strategy according to our current outlook. The following table is a consolidated summary of our operating results for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Revenue 4,651 6,366 (1,715) (27) 15,679 15,063 616 4 Operating Expenses Direct costs 6,973 7,183 (210) (3) 16,700 20,354 (3,654) (18) Research and development 17,319 14,236 3,083 22 54,718 40,391 14,327 35 Selling, general and administrative 7,950 6,444 1,506 23 24,570 19,307 5,263 27 Total operating expenses 32,242 27,863 4,379 16 95,988 80,052 15,936 20 Operating Loss (27,591) (21,497) (6,094) (28) (80,309) (64,989) (15,320) (24) Nonoperating Income and Expense Interest income 4,251 5,213 (962) (18) 13,707 15,041 (1,334) (9) Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 1,591 1,155 436 38 1,793 3,480 (1,687) (48) Interest expense (11) (13) 2 (15) (37) (39) 2 5 Other expense (283) (283) NM (167) (167) NM Total nonoperating income and expense 5,548 6,355 (807) (13) 15,296 18,482 (3,186) (17) Pretax Loss (22,043) (15,142) (6,901) 46 (65,013) (46,507) (18,506) 40 Income tax expense 376 376 NM 887 887 NM Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders (22,419) (15,142) (7,277) 48 (65,900) (46,507) (19,393) (42) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 2,058 (215) 2,273 NM 1,468 2 1,466 NM Comprehensive Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders (20,361) (15,357) (5,004) 33 (64,432) (46,505) (17,927) (39) NM = Not meaningful The key factors driving results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, including the increased operating loss as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, were as follows: Revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to timing of completion of BMW JDA milestones in 2024. Revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily as a result of the commencement of performance under the SK On Agreements. Revenue for 2024 is anticipated to increase, as compared to 2023, primarily due to timing and completion of milestones under the SK On Agreements and continued execution on the BMW JDA.

 Direct costs decreased for the periods, as compared to 2023, primarily due to the timing of labor and materials related to milestones within our agreements in conjunction with improved margins on our projects. Direct costs are anticipated to decrease for 2024, as compared to 2023, due to improved margins on our projects. Research and development costs increased for the periods, as compared to 2023, primarily due to the development efforts focused on improving our electrolyte and continued advancement of our A-2 sample cell designs. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the periods, as compared to 2023, primarily due to workforce development, transactional costs, and strengthening our presence in Korea. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase for 2024, as compared to 2023, due to the same factors. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity The sale of equity has historically been our primary source of cash, with a smaller portion of cash coming from performance milestones on our JDAs and government contracts . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total liquidity, as set forth below: 

(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 37,969 34,537 Marketable securities 94,041 141,505 Investments 216,062 239,566 Total liquidity 348,072 415,608 As of September 30, 2024, contract receivables were 2.6 million, deferred revenue was 6.7 million, and total current liabilities were 20.3 million. As of December 31, 2023, contract receivables were 1.6 million, deferred revenue and deferred revenue from related parties was 0.8 million, and total current liabilities were 15.9 million. Short-Term Liquidity Requirements Short-term liquidity requirements include operating and capital expenses needed to further research and development programs and to further optimize pilot production lines and electrolyte manufacturing capabilities. We anticipate that our most significant capital expenditures for the remainder of 2024 will relate to enhancing the capabilities of our electrolyte production facility, including completion of an EIC that we expect to place fully in service by the end of 2024. We expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements through our cash on hand and other liquid assets. Long-Term Liquidity Requirements We believe that our cash on hand is sufficient to meet our operating cash needs and working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least the next 12 months and longer term until adequate cash flows from licensing activities and/or electrolyte sales can be generated. We also believe that we have adequate cash on hand for our stock repurchase program should we choose to execute additional share repurchases. However, we may require additional liquidity sources if there are material changes to our business conditions or other developments, including changes to our operating plan, development progress, or negotiations with OEMs, cell manufacturers, or other suppliers, market adoption of EVs, supply chain challenges, competitive pressures, inflation, and regulatory developments. To the extent that our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing. We also may opportunistically seek to enhance our liquidity through equity or debt financing, if such financing becomes available on terms that we consider favorable. If financing is not available, or if the terms of financing are unfavorable, we may be forced to take actions to reduce our capital or operating expenditures, which may adversely affect our development, business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

 Stock Repurchase Program On January 23, 2024, we announced that our Board approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase up to 50 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the stock repurchase program, we may purchase shares of our common stock from time to time until the repurchase program expires on December 31, 2025. The shares of common stock may be purchased on the open market, in unsolicited negotiated transactions, or in any manner that complies with the provisions of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. Management s decision to repurchase shares of common stock will depend on a number of factors, such as the price of the common stock, economic and market conditions, and corporate and regulatory requirements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 5,000,000 shares of common stock at an average price of 1.64 per share for an aggregate cost of approximately 8.36 million. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities (50,030) (51,651) Net cash and cash equivalents provided by investing activities 62,139 28,955 Net cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) financing activities (8,677) 31 Cash used in operating activities: Cash used in operating activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2024. The decrease was largely attributable to increased depreciation and amortization expenses as a result of placing SP2 in service, increased deferred revenue as a result of receipt of payment related to a collaborative arrangement ahead of services provided, and decreased contract receivables as a result of receipt of payment from our collaborative arrangements associated with completion of milestones. This benefit was partially offset by increased operating losses, which were driven by a continued increase in research and development and selling, general and administrative costs. Cash provided by investing activities: Cash provided by investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to the net effect of proceeds from the sales of marketable securities and decreased capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities: Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was predominantly related to the effect of cash utilized for the stock repurchase program and withholding of employee taxes related to stock-based compensation. These payments were offset by proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock under the ESPP and exercise of stock options. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ESPP, partially offset by cash paid for withholding of employee taxes related to stock-based compensation and payments on finance lease liabilities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. Critical Accounting Estimates There were no significant and material changes in our critical accounting policies and use of estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those disclosed in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Risk Factors Our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the price of our common stock and warrants, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the price of our common stock and warrants, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since our 2023 Form 10-K .
