CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding
our expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections,
forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, 
 intend, may, possible, potential, predict, project, 
 should, and would, as well as similar expressions, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence
of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward looking. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q may include, for example,
statements about the topics below and are subject to risks and uncertainties including without limitation those described below: 

our
 ability to increase revenue and our ability to improve our gross margins, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, and
 obtain and sustain profitability; 

our
 ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obtain financing on reasonable terms when needed and the effect
 of such additional financing on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stockholders; 

our
 ability to become operationally self-sustaining by controlling our supply chain, especially with respect to stem cells, and becoming
 less reliant on production and manufacturing of our products outside of our control, which we believe will allow us to be a larger
 and more diverse producer of biologics; 

our
 dependence on and ability to retain and recruit independent sales agents and distributors with appropriate expertise and motivate
 and incentivize them to engage with customers and sell our products, including in particular our dependence on key independent agents
 for a significant portion of our revenue; 

the
 ability of our sales personnel, including our independent sales agents and distributors, to achieve expected results; 

our
 ability to integrate the products acquired as part of the acquisition of Surgalign SPV, Inc., the acquisition of certain assets and
 liabilities of Surgalign Holdings, Inc., and the acquisition of certain assets of RTI Surgical, Inc. and achieve future sales of
 those products as anticipated, especially given their respective declines in sales before we acquired them, and other risks associated
 with those acquisitions and any future business combinations or acquisitions we may pursue; 

the
 effect of our private label and original equipment manufacturer OEM business on our business and operating results
 and risks associated therewith, including fluctuations in our operating results and decreased profit margins, and the possibility
 that we may become more in the OEM business; 

our
 ability and success in implementing key growth and process improvement initiatives designed to increase our production capacity,
 revenue and scale and risks associated with such growth and process improvement initiatives; 

our
 ability to implement successfully our four key growth pillars, which are focused on introducing new products; expanding our distribution
 network and achieving greater contract access; leveraging and penetrating adjacent markets and completing targeted strategic acquisitions; 

risks
 associated with our international operations, including but not limited to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
 and compliance with foreign legal and regulatory requirements, current and future wars, related sanctions and geopolitical tensions,
 political risks associated with the potential instability of governments and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers
 or suppliers conduct business, and other potential conflicts; 

our
 ability to operate in international markets and effectively manage our international subsidiaries, which require management attention
 and financial resources; 

our
 ability to navigate manufacturing challenges related to the production of biologics products and recover from our prior stem cell
 shortage and our ability to win back stem cell customers and achieve future stem cell revenue as anticipated; 

our
ability to retain and expand our agreements with group purchasing organizations GPOs and independent delivery networks IDNs and sell products to members of such GPOs and IDNs; 

ii 

the
 effect of inflation and supply chain disruptions, which could result in delayed product launches, lost revenue, higher costs, decreased
 profit margins, and other adverse effects on our business and operating results; 

the
 effect of labor and staffing shortages at hospitals and other medical facilities on the number of elective procedures in which our
 products are used and as a result our revenues, as well as global and local labor shortages and loss of personnel, which have adversely
 affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to produce product to meet demand; 

our
 ability to remain competitive; 

our
 ability to rebrand and integrate acquired products with our existing product line and successfully transition our customers from
 some of our older legacy hardware products to these new products and the anticipated adverse effect of these transitions on our organic
 revenue growth rate; 

our
 ability to innovate, develop, introduce, market and license new products and technologies and the success of such new products and
 technologies, including our recently launched Cortera Posterior Fixation System, viable bone matrix, OsteoVive 
 Plus, and amniotic membrane allografts, SimpliGraft and SimpliMax 

our
 reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers; 

the
 effect of product liability claims and other litigation to which we may be subjected and product recalls and defects; 

the
 effect of infectious diseases on our business, operating results and financial condition; 

the
 effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our earnings and our foreign currency translation adjustments; 

risks
 associated with and the effect of a shift in procedures using our products from hospitals to ambulatory surgical centers, which would
 put pressure on the price of our products and margins; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad and the effect of government regulations and
 our compliance with government regulations; 

the
 ability of our clinical trials to demonstrate competent and reliable evidence of the safety and effectiveness of our products; 

our
 ability to remain accredited with the American Association of Tissue Banks and continue to obtain a sufficient number of donor cadavers
 for our products; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain government and third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products; 

our
 ability to attract, retain and engage qualified technical, sales and processing personnel and members of our management team, especially
 in light of a tight labor market and increasing cost of living in and around the Belgrade, Montana area; 

our
 ability to service our debt and comply with the covenants in our credit agreements and the effect of our significant indebtedness
 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects; 

our
 expectations regarding operating trends, future financial performance and expense management and our estimates of our future revenue,
 expenses, ongoing losses, gross margins, operating leverage, capital requirements and our need for, or ability to obtain, additional
 financing and the availability of our credit facilities; 

our
 ability to effectively remediate our outstanding material weaknesses and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; 

our
 ability to license certain of our intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms and our ability to maintain any such licenses; 

our
 ability to obtain and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and operate without infringing the intellectual property
 rights of others; 

our
 ability to maintain our stock listing on the NYSE American Exchange; 

risks
 inherent in being a controlled company; and 

the
 effect of a global economic slowdown, rising interest rates and the prospects for recession, a possible U.S. government shutdown
 in December 2024, as well as past and potential future disruptions in access to bank deposits or lending commitments due to bank
 failures, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated.
These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, or assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, which
may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described in the Risk Factors section
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and this Form 10-Q. 

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

million and
negative cash flows from operating activities of million. We believe that our million of cash and cash equivalents as of September
30, 2024, together with our anticipated operating cash flows and amounts available under our credit facilities, as discussed further
in Note 11, Debt , will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least November 2025. However,
we may require or seek additional capital to fund our future operations and business strategy prior to November 2025. Accordingly, there
is no assurance that we will not need or seek additional financing prior to such time. Additionally, we can give no assurances that we
will be able to secure additional sources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds are available to us, that such additional
financing will be sufficient to meet our needs or on terms acceptable to us. This is particularly true if economic and market conditions
deteriorate or our business, financial performance or prospects deteriorate. In addition, prior to raising additional equity or debt
financing, we may be required to obtain the consent of MidCap Financial Trust and MidCap Funding IV Trust under our Credit Agreements
and/or OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP Royalty Opportunities and ROS Acquisition Offshore LP ROS under our Investor Rights Agreement with them, and no assurance can be provided that they would provide such consent, which could limit
our ability to raise additional financing and the terms thereof. 

shares of common
stock to accredited investors in a private placement at a per share purchase price of at a closing held on August 9, 2024. The
gross proceeds to us from the private placement were million, before deducting estimated offering fees and expenses payable by us.
We expect to use the net proceeds of million from the private placement for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

impairments of long-lived assets were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023. 

impairments of goodwill
were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

million in cash (the Purchase
Price ). The closing contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement occurred on February 28, 2023 (the Closing ). 

Immediately
prior to the Closing, Seller and its affiliates transferred and assigned to Surgalign SPV, a newly formed entity wholly owned by Seller,
certain intellectual property, contractual rights and other assets related to the design, manufacture, sale and distribution of Seller s
Coflex and CoFix products in the United States (the Coflex Business ). The Coflex and CoFix products have been approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe lumbar spinal stenosis in conjunction with decompression
and provide minimally invasive, motion preserving stabilization. 

In
conjunction with the Equity Purchase Agreement, on February 28, 2023, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Surgalign
SVP and Seller, whereby Seller agreed to provide, or cause to be provided, to us on and after the effective date of the Equity Purchase
Agreement, after giving effect to the Closing, certain transitional services related to the transition of the Coflex Business. 

We
funded the Purchase Price with cash on hand and approximately million of indebtedness incurred under our term loan, refer to Note
11 Debt for additional information. 

We
recorded the purchase of this acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, recognized the assets acquired
at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. The table below represents the allocation of the total consideration for Surgalign
SPV s assets and liabilities based on management s estimates of their respective fair values as of February 28, 2023 (in
thousands): 

Equipment 

Intangible assets 

Net assets acquired 

Goodwill 

Total purchase consideration 

The
acquisition was recorded by allocating the costs of the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
The fair values were based on management s analysis, including work performed by third-party valuation specialists. 

The
acquisition strengthened the Company s spine portfolio with the addition of the Coflex Business.
Coflex is a differentiated and minimally invasive motion preserving stabilization implant that had a premarket application approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe lumbar spinal stenosis in conjunction with decompression.
This potential benefit resulted in the Company paying a premium for the acquisition resulting in the recognition of million in goodwill.
For tax purposes, goodwill is deductible. 

million, plus Liabilities, with cash on hand. 

We
recorded the purchase of the Transaction using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, recognized the assets acquired
at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. The table below represents the allocation of the total consideration for Surgalign Holdings assets
and liabilities based on management s estimates of their respective fair values as of August 10, 2023 (in thousands): 

Accounts receivable 

Inventories 

Prepaids and other current assets 

Equipment 

Right-of-use asset 

Accounts payable 

Accrued liabilities 

Current portion of lease liability 

Fixed assets 

Intangible assets 

Lease liability, less current portion 

Net assets acquired 

Bargain purchase gain 

Deferred tax liability 

Goodwill 

Total purchase consideration 

The
Transaction was recorded by allocating the costs of the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
The fair values were based on management s analysis, including work performed by third-party valuation specialists. 

ASC
805, Business Combinations , requires that any excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable
intangibles and liabilities assumed, be recognized as goodwill and any excess of fair value of acquired net assets, including identifiable
intangible assets over the acquisition consideration, results in a gain from bargain purchase. Prior to recording a gain, the acquiring
entity must reassess whether all assets acquired and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re-measurements
to verify that the consideration paid, assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been properly valued. The Transaction resulted in
a gain on bargain purchase due to the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeding the purchase consideration
transferred by million and is shown as a gain on bargain purchase on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. Upon completion
of our assessment, we concluded that recording a gain on bargain purchase was appropriate and required under ASC 805. The bargain purchase
was primarily attributable to the Transaction occurring as part of bankruptcy proceedings. 

The
Company believes that the Transaction will strengthen our growing orthobiologics and spinal fusion device portfolio, while expanding
our commercial footprint with new contracts and distributors. 

million in cash on hand plus million of contingent payments based on future sales of next generation
nanOss products. The Company previously acquired nanOss distribution rights and certain nanOss intellectual property with the acquisition
of assets related to the biologics and spinal fixation business of Surgalign Holdings, Inc. in August 2023. The potential benefit associated
with the improved economics of internal production of nanOss products resulted in the Company paying a premium for the acquisition resulting

The
following unaudited pro forma combined financial information summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated as if the
Transaction, the acquisition of Surgalign SPV, Inc. and the acquisition of nanOss production operations from RTI Surgical, Inc. had been
completed as of January 1, 2023 (in thousands): 

Net loss 

Pro
forma information reflects adjustments that are expected to have a continuing impact on the Company s results of operations and
are directly attributable to the Transaction, the acquisition of Surgalign SPV, Inc. and the acquisition of nanOss production operations
from RTI Surgical, Inc. The unaudited pro forma results include adjustments to reflect the amortization of the inventory step-up and
the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the values of each identifiable intangible asset. The pro forma
amounts do not purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually been obtained if the transactions had occurred as of
January 1, 2023 or that may be obtained in the future, and do not reflect future synergies, integration costs, or other such costs or
savings. 

Revenue
was approximately million and net losses were approximately million for Surgalign SPV and the hardware and biologics business
of Surgalign Holdings, collectively, from the dates of acquisition to September 30, 2023. 

For
each surgical procedure, the sales agent reports use of the product by the hospital and, as soon as practicable thereafter, ensures that
the hospital provides a purchase order to the Company. Revenue is recognized upon utilization of product. 

Additionally,
the Company sells product directly to domestic and international stocking resellers, original equipment manufacturer resellers and private
label resellers. Upon receipt and acceptance of a purchase order from a stocking reseller, the Company ships product and invoices the
reseller. The Company recognizes revenue when the control is transferred upon shipment or upon delivery, based on the customer contract
terms and legal requirements, and the transfer of title and risk of loss occurs. There is generally no customer acceptance or other condition
that prevents the Company from recognizing revenue in accordance with the delivery terms for these sales transactions. In the normal
course of business, the Company accepts returns of product that have not been implanted. Product returns are not material to the Company s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather than a
separate performance obligation. The Company s policy is to record revenue net of any applicable sales, use, or excise taxes. Payment
terms are generally net 30 days from invoice date and some customers are offered discounts for early pay. The consideration for goods
or services reflects any fixed amount stated per the contract and estimates for any variable consideration, such as returns, discounts
or rebates, to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty
associated with the variable consideration is resolved. For certain sales transactions, we incur GPO fees that are based on a contractual
percentage of applicable sales and are treated as consideration payable to a customer and recorded as a reduction of revenue. 

The
Company recognizes revenue in certain circumstances before product delivery occurs (commonly referred to as bill-and-hold transactions).
When the Company enters into bill-and-hold arrangements, the Company determines if the customer obtains control of the product by determining
(a) the reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement; (b) whether the product was identified separately as belonging to the customer; (c)
whether the product was ready for physical transfer to the customer; and (d) whether the Company was unable to utilize the product or
direct it to another customer. For bill-and-hold arrangements, the associated product inventory is identified separately by the Company
as belonging to the customer and is ready for physical transfer. At September 30, 2024, million was included in revenue for products
that had not shipped. 

The
Company operates in reportable segment with its net revenue derived primarily from the sale of orthobiologics and spinal implant
products across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. Sales are reported net of returns, discounts and rebates. The
following table presents revenues from these product lines for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Performance
Stock Units 

During
2024, the Company began awarding performance stock units, or PSUs, under the 2023 Plan to certain executive officers and key employees.
The Company has awarded an aggregate of PSUs, assuming target performance, and each PSU award can be earned and vested at the
end of a three-year performance period based on the total stockholder return, or TSR, of the Company s common stock price relative
to a group of peer companies and subject to continued service to the Company. The number of shares of the Company s common stock
to be issued upon vesting and settlement of the PSUs range from to of the target number of shares underlying the award, depending
on the Company s performance against the group of peer companies. The fair value of the PSUs was estimated using the Monte Carlo
simulation model and the following assumptions: the volatility of the peer companies was unique to each company used in simulation, Company
volatility of , risk-free interest rate of , correlation with index of , and dividend yield of .

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
Management s Discussion and Analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and
other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical
financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and
assumptions. Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed above in
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Business
Overview 

We
develop, manufacture and market regenerative medicine products and medical devices for domestic and international markets. Our products
serve the specialized needs of orthopedic and neurological surgeons, including orthobiologics for the promotion of bone healing, implants
and instrumentation for the treatment of spinal disease. We promote our products in the United States through independent distributors
and stocking agents, supported by direct employees. 

We
have an extensive sales channel of independent commissioned agents and stocking distributors in the United States representing some or
all of our products. We also maintain a national accounts program to enable our agents to gain access to integrated delivery network
hospitals IDNs and through group purchasing organizations GPOs ). We have biologics contracts with major
GPOs, as well as extensive access to IDNs across the United States for both biologics and spine hardware systems. While our focus is
the United States market, we promote and sell our products internationally through direct sales representatives and stocking distribution
partners in Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America, Australia, and certain Pacific region countries. 

We
have focused and intend to continue to focus primarily on four key growth initiatives: (1) introduce new products, including our Cortera 
 Posterior Fixation System, viable bone matrix, OsteoVive Plus, and amniotic membrane allografts, SimpliGraft 
and SimpliMax (2) expand our distribution network; (3) penetrate adjacent markets; and (4) leverage our growth platform with
technology and strategic acquisitions. In furtherance of our growth initiatives, and as described elsewhere in this report, we made the
following three acquisitions last year: 

On
 February 28, 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Surgalign SPV, Inc. Surgalign SPV ),
 a then indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Surgalign Holdings, Inc. Surgalign Holdings ), which held certain intellectual
 property, contractual rights and other assets related to the design, manufacture, sale and distribution of the Coflex and CoFix products
 in the United States, for a purchase price of 17.0 million in cash. 

On
 August 10, 2023, we acquired out of a bankruptcy proceeding certain additional assets of Surgalign Holdings and its subsidiaries,
 including specified inventory, intellectual property and intellectual property rights, contracts, equipment and other personal property,
 records, all outstanding equity securities of Surgalign Holdings international subsidiaries, and intangibles related to the
 business of designing, developing and manufacturing hardware medical technology and distributing biologics medical technology, and
 assume certain related liabilities, for a purchase price of 5 million in cash. 

On
 October 23, 2023, we acquired the nanOss production operations from RTI Surgical, Inc. RTI including certain equipment
 and inventory used in RTI s synthetic bone graft business and assumed from RTI the lease for the nanOss production facility
 located in Greenville, North Carolina. The purchase price for the assets was 2 million in cash plus a low single digit royalty on
 sales prior to October 23, 2028 of next generation nanOss products. 

While
the intent of these four key growth initiatives is to increase our future revenues, no assurance can be provided that we will be successful
in implementing these growth initiatives or increasing our future revenues. 

Since
one of our key growth initiatives is to leverage our growth platform with technology and strategic acquisitions and explore other strategic
transactions with respect to our products and our company, including licenses, business collaborations and other business combinations
or transactions with other companies, we, as a matter of course, often engage in discussions with third parties regarding such matters.

Results
of Operations 

Comparison
of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

Total
revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.9 million and 85.8 million, respectively, which represents an
increase of 12 and 36 , respectively, compared to 25.0 million and 63.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, respectively. These increases are attributed primarily to the contribution of additional sales resulting from the acquisition of
the Surgalign Holdings hardware and biologics business, partially offset by reduced surgical procedures using our products in
the current year periods as compared to the respective prior year periods. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales consists primarily of manufacturing cost, product purchase costs and depreciation of surgical instruments. Cost of sales also
includes reserves for estimated excess inventory, inventory on consignment that may be missing and not returned, and reserves for estimated
missing and damaged consigned surgical instruments. Cost of sales increased by 20 , or 1.9 million, to 11.6 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 from 9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales increased by 35 , or 8.7 million,
to 33.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These
increases are primarily due to greater revenue in the 2024 periods compared to the comparable 2023 periods, as mentioned above. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 58.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 61.3 for the same period
in 2023 and increased to 60.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 60.7 for the same period in 2023. Of the decrease
for the three-month comparison, 350 basis points were due to reduced production throughput, partially offset by 100 basis points related
to additional scale. Of the increase for the nine-month comparison, 250 basis points were due to greater scale, partially offset by 150
basis points related to reduced production throughput. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for corporate employees, cash-based and stock-based compensation related
costs, amortization, and corporate expenses for legal, accounting and professional fees, as well as occupancy costs. General and administrative
expenses increased 5 , or 0.4 million, to 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.1 million for the
same period in 2023. General and administrative expenses increased 35 , or 6.0 million, to 23.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 17.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase for the three-month comparison is primarily attributable
to 0.5 million of severance expense and 0.4 million of additional stock-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by
reduced expense of 0.2 million related to various compensation plans. The increase for the nine-month comparison is primarily attributable
to 1.4 million of additional expense related to various compensation plans , 1.5 million of additional
stock-based compensation expense, 0.9 million of additional professional service fees, 0.5 million of additional hardware and software
expense and 0.5 million of severance expense. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales commissions, personnel costs for sales and marketing employees, costs for trade shows,
sales conventions and meetings, travel expenses, advertising, and other sales and marketing related costs. Sales and marketing increased
7 , or 0.8 million, to 11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.1 million for the same period in
2023. Sales and marketing expenses increased 40 , or 10.7 million, to 37.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 26.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase for the three-month comparison is primarily due to additional commission expense
of 0.6 million resulting from revenue growth. The increase for the nine-month comparison is primarily due to additional commission expense
of 6.3 million resulting from revenue growth and 3.0 million of additional compensation expense related to additional headcount. 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of internal costs for the development of new technologies. Research and development expenses
were 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. Research and development
expenses were 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increases
for the three- and nine-month comparisons are primarily due to 0.1 million and 0.5 million, respectively, of compensation expense related
to additional headcount. 

19 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense consists of interest incurred from our debt instruments and finance leases. Interest expense was 1.2 million and 3.0 million
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 2.1 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in interest expense during the three- and nine-month
comparisons resulted primarily from additional borrowings on our revolving line of credit and the additional borrowing of 5.0
million under our term credit agreement in May 2024. 

Provision
for Income Taxes Current and Deferred 

Income
tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million compared to income tax benefit of 2.3 million for the same
period in 2023. The change resulted primarily from the tax benefit associated with release of valuation allowance resulting from recognition
of deferred tax liabilities in purchase accounting during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million compared to income tax benefit of 2.3 million for the same period in 2023. The change
resulted primarily from the tax benefit associated with release of valuation allowance resulting from recognition of deferred tax liabilities
in purchase accounting during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Working
Capital 

Since
our inception, we have financed our operations through primarily operating cash flows, private placements of equity securities and convertible
debt, debt facilities, common stock rights offerings, and other debt transactions. The following table summarizes our working capital

Cash
Flows 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 12.6 million compared to 8.6 million for the first nine months
of 2023. This increase in net cash used in operating activities relates primarily to the combination of the increase in net loss during
the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 3.2 million compared to 22.5 million for the first nine months
of 2023. This decrease relates primarily to the use
of 21.4 million in cash for the acquisitions of Surgalign SPV, Inc. and Surgalign Holdings, Inc. s hardware and biologics business
during the first nine months of 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 16.9 million compared to 19.4 million for the first nine
months of 2023. This decrease relates primarily to 9.6 million of greater proceeds from private placements during the first nine months
of 2023, partially offset by greater borrowings during the first nine months of 2024 under the Revolving Facility, as defined below,
net of repayments. 

20 

Current
and Prior Credit Facilities 

On
March 7, 2024, the Company, as guarantor, and certain of our subsidiaries, as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers ),
entered into an Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (Term Loan) (as amended from time to time, the Term
Credit Agreement and an Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (Revolving Loan) (as amended from time to
time, the Revolving Credit Agreement and, together with the Term Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreements with MidCap Financial Trust and MidCap Funding IV Trust, each in its respective capacity as agent, and lenders from time to time party
thereto. These Credit Agreements amend and restate the Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of May 6, 2021 (Term Loan),
as amended (the Prior Term Credit Agreement ), and the Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of May 6, 2021
(Revolving Loan), as amended (the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement and, together with the Prior Term Credit Agreement,
the Prior Credit Agreements ), in each case, by and among the Borrowers, the Company and MidCap Financial Trust and MidCap
Funding IV Trust, as respective agents, and the lenders from time to time party thereto. 

On
May 14, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guarantee Agreement (Term Loan) Term
Amendment No. 1 ), which amends the Term Credit Agreement, and Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guarantee
Agreement (Revolving Loan) Revolving Amendment No. 1 and, together with Term Amendment No. 1, the Amendments No.
1 ), which amends the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Term Amendment No. 1 increases the amount of term loans that may be borrowed
by 5.0 million to a maximum of 22.0 million, which are fully drawn as of September 30, 2024. In addition, the Amendments No. 1 re-set
the date certain fees payable in connection with optional prepayments are determined to May 14, 2024 and consequently extend such fees 
original expiration. The exit fees were increased by 2.50 to 6.50 of the principal amount borrowed pursuant to the Term Credit Agreement.
The terms of borrowing under the Credit Agreements otherwise remain materially unchanged. 

The
Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility, and, together with
the secured term credit facility under the Term Credit Agreement, the Facilities under which the Borrowers may borrow
up to 17.0 million at any one time, the availability of which is determined based on a borrowing base equal to percentages of certain
accounts receivable and inventory of the Borrowers in accordance with a formula set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. All borrowings
under the Revolving Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default, the accuracy
of representations and warranties in all material respects and the delivery of an updated borrowing base certificate. 

The
Facilities have a maturity date of March 1, 2029. Each of the Borrowers, and the Company, as guarantor, are jointly and severally liable
for all of the obligations under the Facilities on the terms set forth in the Credit Agreements. The Borrowers obligations, and
the Company s obligations as a guarantor, under the Credit Agreements are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all
of their assets, including, without limitation, all inventory, equipment, accounts, intellectual property and other assets of the Company
and the Borrowers. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 12.9 million outstanding and 3.8 million of availability under the Revolving
Facility. 

The
loans and other obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreements will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of the SOFR Interest
Rate, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreements, plus the applicable margin of 6.50 in the case of the Term Credit Agreement,
and an applicable margin of 4.50 in the case of the Revolving Credit Agreement, subject in each case to a floor of 2.50 . As of December
31, 2023, the effective rate of the Prior Term Credit Agreement, inclusive of authorization of debt issuance costs and accretion of the
final payment, was 14.42 , and the effective rate of the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement was 9.94 . 

The
Credit Agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants
that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Borrowers, subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness
and additional liens on their assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, pay dividends or make other distributions,
voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of their
businesses. In addition, the Credit Agreements require the Borrowers and the Company to maintain net product revenue at or above minimum
levels and to maintain a certain minimum liquidity level, in each case as specified in the Credit Agreements. As of September 30, 2024,
we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreements. 

Cash
Requirements 

We
believe that our 7.1 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with our anticipated operating cash flows,
including fees associated with licensing agreements, and amounts available under the Facilities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
cash requirements through at least November 2025. However, we may require or seek additional capital to fund our future operations and
business strategy prior to November 2025. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will not need or seek additional financing prior
to such time. 

We
may elect to raise additional financing even before we need it if market conditions for raising additional capital are favorable. We
may seek to raise additional financing through various sources, such as equity and debt financings, or additional debt restructurings
or refinancings. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure additional sources of funds to support our operations, or if
such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs or on terms acceptable to us. This
is particularly true if economic and market conditions deteriorate or our business, financial performance or prospects deteriorate. 

21 

To
the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities or the restructuring or refinancing
of our debt, the interests of our current stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include discounted equity purchase prices, warrant
coverage, liquidation or other preferences or rights that would adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. If we issue
common stock, we may do so at purchase prices that represent a discount to our trading price and/or we may issue warrants to the purchasers,
which could further dilute our current stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could adversely affect the rights of our stockholders
or reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights or preferences granted to future holders of preferred stock may
include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions
on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that
include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures
or declaring dividends. Prior to raising additional equity or debt financing, we may be required to obtain the consent of MidCap Financial
Trust and MidCap Funding IV Trust under our Credit Agreements and/or ROS and Royalty Opportunities under our Investor Rights Agreement
with them, and no assurance can be provided that they would provide such consent, which could limit our ability to raise additional financing
and the terms thereof. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and
on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any such differences may be material. 

There
have been no changes in our critical accounting estimates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the critical accounting
estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

item 4. controls and procedures 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, and as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting discussed below, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30,
2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Previously
Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

As
previously described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, in connection with the audit of our
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we identified certain control deficiencies in the design
and implementation of our internal control over financial reporting, which constituted two material weaknesses. A material weakness is
a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

22 

More
specifically, our controls surrounding the completeness and accuracy of information utilized in determining the open balance sheet fair
value of inventory, which includes the establishment of inventory reserves, related to the acquisition of the hardware and biologics
business of Surgalign Holdings. were insufficient and did not operate at an appropriate level of precision. Our review of certain data
and assumptions utilized in our valuation of opening balance sheet inventory failed to identify inconsistent assumptions related to inventory
utilization and inventory costing. This constituted a material weakness. In addition to the foregoing material weakness, due to insufficient
time and resources, we did not appropriately design, implement and execute sufficient controls and procedures to verify the existence
of inventory on consignment that was acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Surgalign SPV. and the hardware and biologics business
of Surgalign Holdings during the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in a second material weakness. 

The
material weaknesses described above, if not remediated, could result in a material misstatement of one or more disclosures in our annual
or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. 

Our management, under the oversight
of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, is continuing to implement measures designed to improve our internal control over financial
reporting to remediate the identified material weaknesses. The remediation actions we are taking, and expect to take, include the following: 

Precision of Controls Related to Completeness and Accuracy of Information Utilized in Determining the Opening Balance Sheet Fair Value of Inventory . To prevent similar occurrences in the future, we plan to add additional accounting personnel to allow for more robust review of nonrecurring, complex transactions. We expect to have additional headcount in place by end of fiscal 2024. Additionally, if necessary, we may utilize external accounting resources to review future valuations of acquired inventory. 

Insufficient Procedures to Confirm the Existence of Acquired Consigned Inventory . Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we began subjecting our acquired consigned inventory to our ongoing inventory field audits, with the goal of verifying all consigned inventory acquired during the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect this process to be completed by the end of fiscal 2024. 

As management continues to evaluate and work to remediate the material
weaknesses, we may determine to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses. However, we cannot provide assurance that
the measures we have taken to date, or that we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses or avoid
potential future material weaknesses. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the remediation steps described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 My charges and lawsuits against Employer; except that I may, but am not required to,
 withdraw or dismiss, or attempt to withdraw or dismiss, any charges that I may have pending
 against Employer with the Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC or
 other civil rights enforcement agency. In exchange for My agreement to release My Claims,
 I am receiving satisfactory Consideration from Employer to which I am not otherwise entitled
 by law, contract, or under any Employer policy. The Consideration I am receiving is a full
 and fair consideration for the release of all My Claims. Employer does not owe Me anything
 in addition to what I will be receiving according to the Separation Agreement which I have
 signed. 

III. Unknown
 Claims . In waiving and releasing any and all actual, potential, or threatened claims
 against Employer, whether or not now known to me, I understand that this means that if I
 later discover facts different from or in addition to those facts currently known by me,
 or believed by me to be true, the waivers and releases of this Release will remain effective
 in all respects despite such different or additional facts and My later discovery
 of such facts, even if I would not have agreed to the Separation Agreement and this Release
 if I had prior knowledge of such facts. 

IV. Confirmation
 of No Claims, Etc . I am not aware of any other facts, evidence, allegations, claims,
 liabilities, or demands relating to alleged or potential violations of law that may give
 rise to any claim or liability on the part of any Released Party under the Securities Exchange
 Act of 1934, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
 Consumer Protection Act, the False Claims Act, the Anti-kickback Statute. I understand that
 nothing in this Release interferes with My right to file a complaint, charge or report with
 any law enforcement agency, with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC or other regulatory body, or to participate in any manner in an SEC or other governmental
 investigation or proceeding under any such law, statute or regulation, or to require notification
 or prior approval by Employer of any such a complaint, charge or report. I understand and
 agree, however, that I waive My right to recover any whistleblower award under the Securities
 Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
 and Consumer Protection Act, or other individual relief in any administrative or legal action
 whether brought by the SEC or other governmental or law enforcement agency, Me, or any other
 party, unless and to the extent that such waiver is contrary to law. I agree that the Released
 Parties reserve any and all defenses which they might have against any such allegations or
 claims brought by Me or on My behalf. I understand that Employer is relying on My representations
 in this Release and related Separation Agreement.

 full knowledge of its consequences. I understand that Employer is giving Me twenty-one (21)
 days from the date I received a copy of this Release to decide whether I want to sign it.

 the effect of this Release. If I sign this Release before the end of the twenty-one (21)
 day period it will be My personal, voluntary decision to do so, and will be done with full
 knowledge of My legal rights. I agree that material and/or immaterial changes to the Separation
 Agreement or this Release will not restart the running of this consideration period. I also
