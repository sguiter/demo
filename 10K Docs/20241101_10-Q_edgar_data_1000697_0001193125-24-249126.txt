billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories and services. The acquisition expanded Waters portfolio and increased exposure to large molecule applications. The Company financed this transaction with a combination of cash on its balance sheet and borrowings under its Credit Facility (as defined below). The Company s financial results for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 include the financial results of Wyatt. The Company s financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 only include four-and-a-half

months of the financial results of Wyatt as the closing of the acquisition occurred during the second quarter of 2023. On an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Wyatt acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2023, our consolidated net sales would have been billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the net income calculated on a pro forma basis and actual net income was insignificant primarily due to purchased intangibles amortization expense and interest expense related to our acquisition of Wyatt. 
 In addition, the Company has completed the purchase price allocation for the Wyatt acquisition and there were no material changes as compared to the Company s preliminary purchase price allocation for the Wyatt acquisition. 

The Company s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company s third fiscal quarters for 2024 and 2023 ended on September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions in Form 10-Q
 and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 It is management s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 27, 2024. 

The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million out of million and million out of million, respectively, of the Company s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, million out of million and million out of million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets 

The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. 
 Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts, Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements and Interest Rate Swap Cash Flow Hedges 

The fair values of the Company s cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate cross-currency swap agreements and interest rate swap cash flow hedges are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. 
 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 

The Company s accounts receivable and accounts payable are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company s variable interest rate debt approximates fair value due to the variable nature of the interest rate. The carrying value of the Company s fixed interest rate debt was billion at both September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair value of the Company s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be billion at both September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023 using Level 2 inputs. 

The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S.
 dollar foreign subsidiaries financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. 

The Company s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and yen-denominated
 net asset investments. The Company 
presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts 

 The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. Principal hedged currencies include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. 
 
 million to effectively lock-in
 the forecasted interest payments on the variable rate borrowing over its term. The interest rate swaps represent cash flow hedges and are assessed for hedge effectiveness each reporting period. When the hedge relationship is highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows, the Company will record the entire change in fair value of the interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss is reclassified to income in the period that the underlying transaction impacts consolidated income. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated
 and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to income in the current period. Interest settlements due to benchmark interest rate changes are recorded in interest income or interest expense. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company did not have any cash flow hedges that were deemed ineffective. 

 Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements 

 As of September 28, 2024, the Company had entered into interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with durations up to three years with an aggregate notional value of million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and yen-denominated
 net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations.

The Company has a Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company s net income for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 by million and million, respectively, and increased the Company s net income per diluted share by and , respectively. 
 The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 
 and , respectively. The increase between the effective tax rates can be primarily attributed to the impact of discrete tax benefits in the prior year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax
 income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.

The increase between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to the impact of discrete tax benefits in the prior year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax
 income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 

 The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. 

The

 Company s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2018. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 Effective in 2024, various foreign jurisdictions began implementing aspects of the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
 Development related to the new Pillar Two system of global minimum tax rules. These changes in tax law did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024. The Company continues to monitor the adoption of the Pillar Two rules in additional jurisdictions.

 The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.

The Company s net sales increased 4 in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, with foreign currency translation having minimal impact on total sales growth. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company s net sales decreased 2 , with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The net sales growth in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by strong customer demand across most major geographies, end markets, and product categories. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company s net sales were negatively impacted by our customers delaying purchases of our instrument systems as they remained cautious with their capital spending during the first half of 2024; except in India, where sales growth increased 15 for the first nine months of 2024. The Wyatt acquisition increased sales growth by 2 for the first nine months of 2024. In addition, the Company s first nine months of 2024 had one less calendar day than the first nine months of 2023. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects that foreign currency translation will have a negative impact on sales for the remainder of 2024. Instrument system sales increased 1 for the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by the increase in customer demand across our existing and newly introduced LC, LC-MS and Thermal Analysis instrument system sales. Instrument system sales decreased 11 for the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by weaker customer demand across all major regions during the first half of 2024 caused by delayed capital spending. This decline in instrument system sales was broad-based across all of our instrument systems and was led by our mass spectrometry instrument systems, which are higher priced instruments that are significantly impacted by the timing and level of funding our academic and government customers receive. The Wyatt acquisition increased instrument system sales growth by 3 for the first nine months of 2024. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on instrument system sales growth for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 6 and 5 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1 for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Service revenues increased 6 and 5 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. Wyatt contributed 1 to service revenue growth for the first nine months of 2024. Chemistry sales growth increased 8 and 4 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. Operating income increased 18 for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher sales volume and cost savings from recent workforce reductions being partially offset by an increase in annual incentive compensation. In addition, the increase in operating income was impacted by 23 million of severance-related costs incurred in the third quarter of 2023 in connection with a worldwide reduction in the Company s workforce. Operating income decreased 3 for the first nine months of 2024, due to lower sales volume and the increases in annual incentive compensation expense, purchased intangibles amortization associated with the Wyatt acquisition, severance-related costs associated with a workforce reduction in China in the first quarter of 2024 and certain litigation settlements. In addition, the change in operating income was also impacted by the cost savings from the workforce reductions and the costs incurred in the first nine months of 2023, which included 13 million of transaction costs related to the Wyatt acquisition and 27 million of severance-related costs in connection with a worldwide reduction in the Company s workforce in 2023. The negative effect of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by approximately 3 million and 19 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. The Company generated 522 million and 373 million of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, driven by lower annual incentive bonus payments and an improvement in working capital in the current year. Net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of 90 million and 119 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the completion of the Company s new manufacturing facilities.

During the third quarter of 2024, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 2 , as growth in Europe, India, and Japan was partially offset by weakness in the U.S. and China. Foreign currency translation decreased pharmaceutical sales growth by 1 . Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 9 in the third quarter of 2024, with foreign currency translation increasing sales growth by 2 . Combined sales to academic and government customers increased 2 in the third quarter of 2024, with foreign currency translation increasing sales growth by 2 . During the first nine months of 2024, sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 1 , primarily driven by weakness in customer demand in China, with foreign currency translation decreasing pharmaceutical sales growth by 1 and Wyatt contributing 2 . Combined sales to industrial customers decreased 1 , with foreign currency having minimal impact on sales growth and Wyatt contributing 1 to industrial sales growth. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. Combined sales to academic and government customers decreased 13 , with foreign currency translation increasing sales growth by 1 and Wyatt contributing 2 to the Company s academic and government sales growth. This overall decline in sales of 13 to our academic and government customers in the first nine months of 2024 compares to a 20 increase in academic and government sales in the first nine months of 2023, which represents a two-year compound annual growth rate of 2 .

TA sales growth for the third quarter of 2024 was broad-based across most major geographies, with the exception of China, and was primarily driven by strong customer demand for our thermal analysis instruments and services. During the first nine months of 2024, TA sales decreased 3 due to lower customer demand for TA instrument systems across most major regions. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 1 for the third quarter and decreased 1 for the first nine months of 2024. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 4 in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 3 in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the third quarter is primarily due to higher sales volume, while the decrease in the first nine months of 2024 is primarily due to lower sales volume and changes in sales mix. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to decrease gross profit during 2024. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased 9 and 7 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as the cost savings from the recent workforce reductions that occurred in March 2024 and the absence of costs incurred in the prior year relating to severance charges in connection with the 2023 workforce reduction, the Wyatt acquisition-related retention expenses and the Wyatt acquisition costs were partially offset by an increase in annual incentive compensation expenses. The effect of foreign currency translation had minimal impact on selling and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased expenses by 1 for the first nine months of 2024. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 22.8 and 24.8 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and 26.2 and 26.0 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 8 and 4 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. The increase in these periods was driven by costs associated with the development of new product and technology initiatives. The impact of foreign currency exchange increased expenses by 3 for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024.

Purchased Intangibles Amortization The increase in purchased intangibles amortization of 15 million in the first nine months of 2024, is due to the Wyatt acquisition intangible assets. Litigation Provisions The Company incurred 12 million of litigation provisions in the first nine months of 2024, primarily related to a patent litigation settlement. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net decreased 9 million in the third quarter of 2024 as a result of lower average outstanding debt as compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, interest expense increased 2 million as a result of slightly higher average outstanding debt as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The average outstanding debt in these periods was impacted by the timing of the borrowings to fund the Wyatt acquisition, which closed in May 2023, as well as the timing of the repayment of 755 million of debt since the completion of the acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 , 12.5 , 25 and 17 , respectively, as of September 28, 2024. The Company has a Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company s net income by 9 million and 11 million and increased the Company s net income per diluted share by 0.15 and 0.18 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 16.6 and 12.2 , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate can be primarily attributed to the impact of discrete tax benefits in the prior year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 15.0 and 14.6 , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate can be attributed to the impact of discrete tax benefits in the prior year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. Effective in 2024, various foreign jurisdictions began implementing aspects of the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development related to the new Pillar Two system of global minimum tax rules. These changes in tax law did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. The Company continues to monitor the adoption of the Pillar Two rules in additional jurisdictions.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was 522 million and 373 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher cash collections, lower inventory levels and lower incentive bonus payments, partially offset by lower net income. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: 

The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding was 82 days at September 28, 2024 and 81 days at September 30, 2023. 

The change in inventory can primarily be attributed to the reduction in our production plan as a result of the decline in sales. 

The change in accounts payable and other current liabilities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 2023 were attributable to lower annual incentive payments of 48 million, lower tax payments of 38 million in the current year and the timing of payments to vendors. 

Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled 92 million and 1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were 90 million and 119 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the completion of the Company s new manufacturing facilities. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the Company purchased 3 million and 2 million of investments, respectively, while 3 million and 2 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. On May 16, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt for a total purchase price of 1.3 billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories, and services.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities The Company has a credit agreement with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 2.0 billion. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had a total of 1.8 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of 1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and 570 million borrowed under its credit agreement. The Company s net debt borrowings decreased by 530 million and increased by 0.9 billion during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the prior year increase primarily being due to the funding of the Wyatt acquisition. In July 2024, the Company entered into a private Master Note Facility Agreement (the Shelf Agreement pursuant to which the Company may, at its option, authorize the issuance and sale of senior promissory notes (the Shelf Notes up to an aggregate amount of 200 million. The Company entered into the Shelf Agreement to increase its borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes. The Company has not issued any Shelf Notes pursuant to the Shelf Agreement through the date of these financial statements. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had entered into interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with durations up to three years with an aggregate notional value of 625 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and yen-denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company lowered net interest expense by approximately 8 million during both the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The Company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately 10 million in 2024. In December 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the extension of its existing share repurchase program through January 21, 2025. The Company s remaining authorization is 1.0 billion. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company repurchased 58 million of the Company s outstanding common stock under the Company s share repurchase program. In addition, the Company repurchased 13 million and 12 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity. The Company received 25 million and 18 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company s employee stock purchase plan during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 331 million as of September 28, 2024. The majority of the Company s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with 287 million held by foreign subsidiaries at September 28, 2024, of which 234 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 28, 2024 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2024, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately 3 million to 6 million to its defined benefit plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future.

Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons.

Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of September 28, 2024, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 287 million out of 331 million and 321 million out of 396 million, respectively, of the Company s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, 234 million out of 331 million and 233 million out of 396 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of September 28, 2024 would decrease by approximately 23 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company s market risk during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. For information regarding the Company s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company s legal proceedings during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, other than the 12 million litigation costs primarily related to patent settlements recorded in the nine months ended September 28, 2024. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of September 28, 2024 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion of certain factors under the subheading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and operating results.

Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer During the three months ended September 28, 2024, the Company purchased 216, 58 and 159 shares at a cost of 66 thousand, 20 thousand and 55 thousand with average prices paid of 304.43, 340.26 and 347.55 during fiscal July, August and September, respectively, of equity securities registered by the Company under the Exchange Act. In January 2019, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 4 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. In December 2020, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. In December 2022, the Company s Board of Directors amended and extended this repurchase program s term by one year such that it expired on January 21, 2024 and increased the total authorization level to 4.8 billion, an increase of 750 million. In December 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2025. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 15.2 million shares at a cost of 3.8 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of 1.0 billion authorized for future repurchases. The size and timing of these purchases, if any, will depend on our stock price and market and business conditions, as well as other factors.
