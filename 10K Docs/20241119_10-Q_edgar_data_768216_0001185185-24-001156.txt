Other payables 

Accrued liabilities and other payables 

As of September 30, 2024, accrued liabilities mainly consists of unpaid professional fee such as legal and audit fee. As of December 31, 2023, accrued liabilities mainly consists of unpaid professional fee such as legal and audit fee, other payables mainly consist of due to ex-shareholder, which were all released from repayment as of June 30, 2024.

to , a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income, the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures, deemed repatriation of foreign earnings through a transition tax and significant changes to the taxation of foreign earnings going forward. As a result of the 2017 Act, NOL carryforwards generated in years beginning after December 31, 2017 would carryforward indefinitely, and would apply to 80 of future taxable income. Under the Act, carrybacks of NOLs were disallowed. In March 2021, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security CARES Act was enacted providing a five-year carryback for losses incurred in 2018, 2019, 2020 or 2021, which allows companies to modify tax returns up to five years prior to offset taxable income from those tax years. The CARES Act also suspended the NOL limit of 80 of taxable income, but the NOLs generated in 2018 and forward will still carryforward indefinitely. 

Less valuation allowance 

Net deferred tax asset 

The difference between the income tax benefit in the accompanying statement of operations and the amount that would result if the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21 were applied to pre-tax loss for 2024 and 2023, is attributable to the valuation allowance. 

At September 30, 2024, for federal income tax reporting purposes, the Company has in unused net operating losses available for carryforward to future years which will expire in various years through 2037, and that will carryforward indefinitely.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may , should , expects , plans , anticipates , believes , estimates , predicts , potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP ). All references to common shares refer to the common shares in our capital stock. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report. 

As used in this quarterly report, the terms we , us , our , our company and Logicquest mean Logicquest Technology, Inc., unless otherwise indicated. 

Business Overview 

Our company was formed on July 23, 2001 when Solis Communications, Inc., a company incorporated in the State of Texas on February 26, 2001, completed the acquisition of Berens Industries, Inc., a company originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 9, 1985. On September 17, 2001, we changed our name to Crescent Communications Inc. d.b.a Crescent Broadband. On November 15, 2004, we changed our name to Bluegate Corporation. On March 19, 2015, we changed our name to Logicquest Technology, Inc. On June 23, 2023, the Company changed its name to Coyni, Inc. Coyni ). 

We are a Nevada corporation that previously operated as a broadband network service provider, providing internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis. During May 2014 our board of directors authorized an orderly wind-down of our Company s internet connectivity business which ceased effective June 30, 2014. 

We are currently a company with no operations. To sustain our company s operation, our board is currently seeking investment opportunities. At this stage, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities, what additional financing we will require to complete a business opportunity, or whether the opportunity s operations will be profitable. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our business, our shareholders will lose some or all of their investment and our business will likely fail. 

Effective on April 7, 2023, the selling shareholder of our Company, who owns 97.7 equity ownership of the Company and also holds a control position in the Company sold all of his equity interest in the Company (consisting of 98,000,000 shares of restricted common stock, 48 shares of Series C convertible non-redeemable preferred stock and 10 shares of Series D convertible non-redeemable preferred stock) to RYVYL, Inc. for a total purchase price of 225,000. After giving effect to the purchases, RYVYL Inc. became the major and controlling shareholder of the Company. 

On June 8, 2023, the Company entered an Agreement and plan of Merger with Coyni, Inc. old Coyni ), old Coyni shall be merged with and into the Company (or Coyni ). On or about December 6, 2023, the Company filed a Termination of Merger Termination of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State. Once approved and processed, this will result in the termination of the Merger Agreement entered on June 8, 2023. The Merger Agreement has been rescinded and revoked due to a change in business strategy. The filing of the Termination of Merger is not self-effectuating, and must be approved by the Nevada Secretary of State. In February 2024, the termination of merger was rejected by NV Secretary of State. As a result, the Company has not pursued moving the termination along.

We anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations further in the future. 

Financial Condition 

We did not generate any revenues nor have any cash activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; however, we had 90,301 and 104,282 G A expenses (mainly consisted of professional fees such as legal and audit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we had professional fees of 104,282 and stock compensation expense of 221,702 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

We did not have any investing activities or financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

To date we have relied on proceeds from the sale of our shares and on loans from officers and directors, related companies and an independent third party in order to sustain our basic, minimum operating expenses; however, we cannot guarantee that we will secure any further sales of our shares or that our officers and directors, related companies or the independent third party will provide us with any future loans. We intend to use debt to cover the anticipated negative cash flows until we can operate at a break-even cash flow mode. We may seek additional capital to fund potential costs associated with possible expansion and/or acquisitions. We believe that future funding may be obtained from public or private offerings of equity securities, debt or convertible debt securities, or other sources. Stockholders should assume that any additional funding will likely be dilutive. 

We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. These estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and these differences may be material. See Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this quarterly report for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our unaudited financial statements.

Going Concern 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have been unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support our operations and have been dependent on debt raised from related parties and independent third parties. We experienced negative financial results as follows:

These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and ultimately to attain profitable operations. However, there is no assurance that profitable operations or sufficient cash flows will occur in the future. 

Prior to April 7, 2023, our operations was primarily funded by Logicquest Technology Limited, a company controlled by the Company s former Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Cheng Yew Siong. Effective on April 7, 2023, the selling shareholder of the Company, who owns 99.16 equity ownership of the Company and also holds a control position in the Company sold all of his equity interest in the Company (consisting of 98,000,000 shares of restricted common stock, 48 shares of Series C convertible non-redeemable preferred stock and 10 shares of Series D convertible non-redeemable preferred stock) to RYVYL, Inc. for a total purchase price of 225,000. 

These steps have provided us with the cash flows to continue our business, but have not resulted in significant improvement in our financial position. We are considering alternatives to address our cash flow situation that include: 

Raising capital through additional sale of our common stock and/or debt securities. 

Reducing cash operating expenses to levels that are in line with current revenues. 

These alternatives could result in substantial dilution of existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that our current financial position can be improved, that we can raise additional working capital or that we can achieve positive cash flows from operations. Our long-term viability as a going concern is dependent upon the following: 

Our ability to locate sources of debt or equity funding to meet current commitments and near-term future requirements. 

Our ability to achieve profitability and ultimately generate sufficient cash flow from operations to sustain our continuing operations. 

Off Balance Spreadsheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined in 17 CFR 229.10(f)(1), we are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). These weaknesses involve our lack of experience with U.S. GAAP requirements, as described in more detail in the next section. Solely as a result of these material weaknesses, our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

The Company s internal control over financial reporting included policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of Coyni, Inc.; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Coyni. s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of Coyni, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, due to the material weaknesses described below, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not yet established an internal control over financial reporting systems, as the company is a shell company without ordinary business operations. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes that occurred during the first quarter of the fiscal year covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

On November 8, 2022, the Company s majority shareholder, RYVYL, Inc. RYVYL filed a complaint against its former Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Luna, Luna Consultant Group, LLC and Doe(s) 1 through 50 in San Diego Superior Court (the RYVYL Filing ). RYVYL is alleging that Ms. Luna abused her position for additional compensation, failed to follow proper protocols and breached her fiduciary duties and duty of loyalty by secretly maintaining alternative employment. The action seeks damages, including interest and costs of suit incurred. 

On November 10, 2022, Ms. Luna filed her own complaint against RYVYL and Fredi Nisan in San Diego Superior Court (the Luna Filing ). Ms. Luna alleges that Mr. Nisan used contract negotiations to coerce her, that RYVYL improperly coded transactions and misled investors, and that when her concerns were reported to management, she was wrongfully terminated, resulting in a number of claims. Ms. Luna also alleges sexual misconduct on the part of Mr. Nisan. Ms. Luna is seeking damages including compensatory damages, unpaid wages (past and future), loss of wages and benefits (past and future), and other damages to be proven at trial. RYVYL and Mr. Nisan deny all allegations of the Luna Filing. 

In April 2024, Luna sought to add the Company as a defendant with regard to her claims. She was granted permission to file a Second Amended Complaint to add the Company as a defendant. 

On October 17, 2024, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement, and on October 24, 2024, a stipulated motion to stay all pleadings was filed with the Court.
