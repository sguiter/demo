 Gross Unrealized Investment Losses 
 
 Our investment strategy is to maximize, over a sustained period and within acceptable parameters of quality and risk, investment income and total investment return through active strategic asset allocation and investment management. Accordingly, we may sell securities at a gain or a loss to enhance the projected total return of the portfolio as market opportunities change, to reflect changing perceptions of risk, or to better match certain characteristics of our investment portfolio with the corresponding characteristics of our insurance liabilities.

 Our fixed maturity investments are generally purchased in the context of various long-term strategies, including funding insurance liabilities, so we do not generally seek to generate short-term realized gains through the purchase and sale of such securities. In certain circumstances, including those in which securities are selling at prices which exceed our view of their underlying economic value, or when it is possible to reinvest the proceeds to better meet our long-term asset-liability objectives, we may sell certain securities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, there were fixed maturity investments in default. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the million of gross realized losses on sales of million of fixed maturity securities, available for sale, included: (i) million related to various corporate securities; (ii) million related to commercial mortgage-backed securities; and (iii) million related to various other investments. Securities are generally sold at a loss following unforeseen issuer-specific events or conditions or shifts in perceived relative values. These reasons include but are not limited to: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectation that the market value could deteriorate; (iii) our desire to reduce our exposure (or reflect changing perceptions of risk) related to an asset class, an issuer or an industry; (iv) prospective or actual changes in credit quality; (v) better match certain characteristics of our investment portfolio with the corresponding characteristics of our insurance liabilities; (vi) changes in expected portfolio cash flows; or (vii) an opportunity to enhance the projected total return of the portfolio. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2023, the million of gross realized losses on sales of million of fixed maturity securities, available for sale, included: (i) million related to various corporate securities; (ii) million related to commercial mortgage-backed securities; and (iii) million related to various other investments.

 (a) Primarily comprised of blocks of business that are 100 ceded. 
 (b) Such amount represents the difference between: (i) the total insurance liabilities for our fixed indexed annuities (including the host contract and the related embedded derivative); and (ii) the policyholder account balances for these products. The accounting requirement to bifurcate the embedded derivative and value it at the current estimated fair value results in this amount. 
 (c) In certain instances for interest-sensitive products, the total insurance liabilities for a particular line of business may not be deficient in the aggregate to trigger loss recognition, but the pattern of earnings may be such that profits are expected to be recognized in earlier years followed by losses in later years. In these situations, accounting standards require that an additional liability (the "future loss reserve") be recognized by an amount necessary to sufficiently offset the losses that would be recognized in later years.

Embedded derivatives at fair value Total fixed indexed annuity insurance liabilities 
 
 For presentation in the consolidated balance sheet, the total fixed indexed annuity insurance liability balance is bifurcated between: (i) policyholder account balances (which is the total of all current balances accruing to the policyholder under the terms and conditions of the policies assuming the contracts will continue in force); and (ii) the difference between the total fixed indexed annuity insurance liabilities summarized above and the policyholder account balances, which is classified as future policy benefits. These classifications are summarized below (dollars in millions): 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Policyholder account balances Future policy benefits ) ) Total fixed indexed annuity insurance liabilities 
 
 When the total policyholder account balance exceeds the total fixed indexed annuity insurance liabilities, a negative future policy benefit balance will occur.

insurance product lines (annuity, health and life) and the investment and fee income segments. Our segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of profit margins and the way management makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of the business. 
 
 Our insurance product line segments (annuity, health and life) include marketing, underwriting and administration of the policies our insurance subsidiaries sell. The business written in each of the product categories through all of our insurance subsidiaries is aggregated allowing management and investors to assess the performance of each product category. When analyzing profitability of these segments, we use insurance product margin as the measure of profitability, which is: (i) insurance policy income; and (ii) net investment income allocated to the insurance product lines; less (i) insurance policy benefits and interest credited to policyholders; and (ii) amortization of deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits, non-deferred commissions and advertising expense. Net investment income is allocated to the product lines using the book yield of investments backing the block of business, which is applied to the average net insurance liabilities for the block in each period. Net insurance liabilities for the purpose of allocating investment income to product lines are equal to: (i) policyholder account balances for annuity products; (ii) total reserves before the fair value adjustments reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), if applicable, for all other products; less (iii) amounts related to reinsured business; (iv) deferred acquisition costs; (v) the present value of future profits; and (vi) the value of unexpired options credited to insurance liabilities. 
 
 Income from insurance products is the sum of the insurance product margins of the annuity, health and life product lines, less expenses allocated to the insurance lines. It excludes the income from our fee income business, investment income not allocated to product lines, net expenses not allocated to product lines (primarily holding company expenses) and income taxes. Management believes insurance product margin and income from insurance products help provide a better understanding of the business and a more meaningful analysis of the results of our insurance product lines. 
 
 We market our products through the Consumer and Worksite Divisions that reflect the customers served by the Company. The Consumer and Worksite Divisions are primarily focused on marketing insurance products, several types of which are sold in both divisions and underwritten in the same manner. 
 
 The Consumer Division serves individual consumers, engaging with them on the phone, virtually, online, face-to-face with agents, or through a combination of sales channels. This structure unifies consumer capabilities into a single division and integrates the strength of our agent sales forces with one of the largest direct-to-consumer insurance businesses with proven experience in advertising, web/digital and call center support. 
 
 The Worksite Division focuses on the sale of voluntary benefit life and health insurance products in the workplace for businesses, associations, and other membership groups, interacting with customers at their place of employment and virtually. The Worksite Division also offers employer benefits services that seek to increase benefits engagement and reduce costs for employers and their employees. These services include: benefit administration technology, year-round advocacy, enrollment, benefits compliance and communications services. 
 
 The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability of this segment is the total net investment income not allocated to the insurance products. Investment income not allocated to product lines represents net investment income less: (i) equity returns credited to policyholder account balances; (ii) the investment income allocated to our product lines; (iii) interest expense on notes payable, investment borrowings and financing arrangements; (iv) expenses related to the FABN program; and (v) certain expenses related to benefit plans that are offset by special-purpose investment income; plus (vi) the impact of annual option forfeitures related to fixed indexed annuity surrenders. Investment income not allocated to product lines includes investment income on investments in excess of amounts allocated to product lines, investments held by our holding companies, the spread we earn from our Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") investment borrowing and FABN programs and variable components of investment income (including call and prepayment income, adjustments to returns on structured securities due to cash flow changes, income (loss) from company-owned life insurance ("COLI") and alternative investment income not allocated to product lines), net of interest expense on corporate debt and financing arrangements. The spread earned from our FHLB investment borrowing and FABN programs includes the investment income on the matched assets less: (i) interest on

 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company elected to change its tax method of accounting for indirect costs allocable to self-constructed real estate assets. The change in accounting method would result in a current year tax deduction of certain indirect costs previously capitalized under the Company's prior method of accounting. Accordingly, for tax reporting purposes, the Company expects to recognize a tax loss of million related to the change in accounting method which could be carried forward indefinitely pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, subject to limitations specified in the Internal Revenue Code (the Code"). In the second quarter of 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") revised the list of tax method accounting changes that require approval from the IRS to include tax method accounting changes related to indirect costs allocable to self-constructed real estate assets. Previously, only a taxpayer-initiated election was necessary and IRS approval was not required. The Company requested approval for its tax method change in June 2024. 
 
 If the Company s request for a change in accounting method is ultimately not granted by the IRS, the remaining tax assets would be recharacterized as indirect costs allocable to self-constructed assets. Most of the assets associated with the indirect costs allocable to self-constructed real estate assets are currently held for sale or recently sold. Upon disposal of such assets, the related tax benefits would be reflected as net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") which could be carried forward indefinitely. With respect to the assets not currently held for sale, the tax benefits will be recognized over the year depreciable life of the self-constructed assets or upon disposal. 
 
 Our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and NOLs. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. 
 
 A reduction of the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets by establishing a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, all available evidence, both positive and negative, are considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. This assessment requires significant judgment and considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, and tax planning strategies.

million will be realized through future taxable earnings. 
 
 Recovery of our deferred tax asset is dependent on achieving the level of future taxable income projected in our deferred tax valuation model and failure to do so could result in the recognition of a valuation allowance in a future period. The recognition of a valuation allowance would increase income tax expense and reduce shareholders' equity, and such an increase could have a significant impact upon our earnings in the future. 
 
 The Code limits the extent to which losses realized by a non-life entity (or entities) may offset income from a life insurance company (or companies) to the lesser of: (i) percent of the income of the life insurance company; or (ii) percent of the total loss of the non-life entities (including NOLs of the non-life entities). There is no similar limitation on the extent to which losses realized by a life insurance entity (or entities) may offset income from a non-life entity (or entities). 
 
 Section 382 of the Code imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to use its NOLs when the company undergoes a 50 percent ownership change over a three-year period. Future transactions and the timing of such transactions could cause an ownership change for Section 382 income tax purposes. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to, additional repurchases under our securities repurchase program, issuances of common stock and acquisitions or sales of shares of CNO stock by certain holders of our shares, including persons who have held, currently hold or may accumulate in the future five percent or more of our outstanding common stock for their own account. Many of these transactions are beyond our control. If an additional ownership change were to occur for purposes of Section 382, we would be required to calculate an annual restriction on the use of our NOLs to offset future taxable income. The annual restriction would be calculated based upon the value of CNO's equity at the time of such ownership change, multiplied by a federal long-term tax exempt rate percent at September 30, 2024), and the annual restriction could limit our ability to use a substantial portion of our NOLs to offset future taxable income or may defer the utilization of such NOLs. We regularly monitor ownership change (as calculated for purposes of Section 382) and, as of September 30, 2024, we were below the percent ownership change level that could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. 
 
 billion of federal non-life NOLs as of September 30, 2024, as summarized below (dollars in millions):

 ____________________ 
 (a) Pending IRS approval of our tax method change or disposal of self-constructed assets. 
 
 Our non-life NOLs with expiration dates can be used to offset 35 percent of life insurance company taxable income and 100 percent of non-life company taxable income until all non-life NOLs are utilized or expire. Our non-life NOLs with no expiration date can be used to offset 35 percent of life insurance company taxable income and 80 percent of non-life company taxable income. 
 We also had deferred tax assets related to NOLs for state income taxes of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The related state NOLs are available to offset future state taxable income in certain states and are expected to be fully utilized prior to expiration.

 On May 13, 2024, the Company issued million of Senior Notes due 2034 (the "2034 Notes"). The 2034 Notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of June 12, 2019 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 13, 2024 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), each between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"). The 2034 Notes mature on June 15, 2034, unless earlier repurchased by the Company, and interest on the 2034 Notes is payable at per annum. Interest on the 2034 Notes is paid semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2024. 
 
 The 2034 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with the Company s other senior unsecured and unsubordinated debt from time to time outstanding, including obligations under our Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below). The 2034 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of the Company s future indebtedness that is secured, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2034 Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company s subsidiaries. 
 
 The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than in aggregate principal amount of the 2034 Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the 2034 Notes, and the interest accrued on such 2034 Notes, if any, to be immediately due and payable. In the case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company, the principal amount of the securities together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon will automatically be and become immediately due and payable.

million revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"), among other things, (i) requires the Company to maintain (each as calculated in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement): (i) a debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding hybrid securities, except to the extent that the aggregate amount outstanding of all such hybrid securities exceeds an amount equal to percent of total capitalization) of not more than percent (such ratio was percent at September 30, 2024); and (ii) a minimum consolidated net worth of not less than the sum of (x) million plus (y) percent of the net equity proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale of equity interests in the Company (the Company's consolidated net worth was million at September 30, 2024 compared to the minimum requirement of million ). The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Agreement is July 16, 2026. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain other restrictive covenants with which the Company must comply. The interest rate applicable to loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement is calculated as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") (plus a credit spread adjustment of percent for all available interest periods) or the base rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), at the Company's option, plus a margin based on the Company's unsecured debt rating. The margins under the Revolving Credit Agreement range from percent to percent, in the case of loans at the SOFR, and percent to percent, in the case of loans at the base rate. The commitment fee under the Revolving Credit Agreement is based on the Company's unsecured debt rating. There were amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

of the Company's insurance subsidiaries (Bankers Life and Casualty Company ("Bankers Life"), Washington National Insurance Company ("Washington National") and Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company ("Colonial Penn")) are members of the FHLB. As members of the FHLB, our insurance subsidiaries have the ability to borrow on a collateralized basis from the FHLB. We are required to hold certain minimum amounts of FHLB common stock as a condition of membership in the FHLB, and additional amounts based on the amount of the borrowings. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the FHLB common stock was million. As of September 30, 2024, collateralized borrowings from the FHLB totaled billion and the proceeds were used to purchase variable rate fixed maturity securities with similar durations. The borrowings are classified as investment borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The borrowings are collateralized by investments with an estimated fair value of billion at September 30, 2024, which are maintained in a custodial account for the benefit of the FHLB. Substantially all of such investments are classified as fixed maturities, available for sale, in our consolidated balance sheet.

 During the first nine months of 2024, the VIEs recognized investment losses of million which were comprised of: (i) million of net losses from the sales of fixed maturities; (ii) million of gains related to the liquidation of VIEs; and (iii) a decrease in the allowance for credit losses of million. Such net realized losses included gross realized losses of million from the sale of million of investments. During the first nine months of 2023, the VIEs recognized net investment losses of million which were comprised of: (i) million of net losses from the sales of fixed maturities; and (ii) a decrease in the allowance for credit losses of million. Such net realized losses included gross realized losses of million from the sale of million of investments. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, there were fixed maturity investments held by the VIEs in default. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the VIEs held: (i) investments (for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded) with a fair value of million and gross unrealized losses not deemed to have credit losses of million that had been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months; and (ii) investments (for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded) with a fair value of million and gross unrealized losses not deemed to have credit losses of million that had been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater. 
 
 At December 31, 2023, the VIEs held: (i) investments (for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded) with a fair value of million and gross unrealized losses of million that had been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months; and (ii) investments (for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded) with a fair value of million and gross unrealized losses of million that had been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater. 
 
 The investments held by the VIEs are evaluated for impairment in a manner that is consistent with the Company's fixed maturities, available for sale. 
 
 In addition, the Company, in the normal course of business, makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the investment manager. These structured securities include asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities and 
 non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Our maximum exposure to loss on these securities is limited to our cost basis in the investment. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these structured securities due to the relative size of our investment in comparison to the total principal amount of the individual structured securities and the level of credit subordination which reduces our obligation to absorb gains or losses. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we held investments in various limited partnerships and hedge funds, in which we are not the primary beneficiary, totaling million (classified as other invested assets). At September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments to these partnerships totaling million. Our maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of our investment.

percent of our Level 3 fixed maturity securities and trading securities were valued using unadjusted broker quotes or broker-provided valuation inputs. The remaining Level 3 fixed maturity investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs. For these securities, we use internally developed valuations. Key assumptions used to determine fair value for these securities may include risk premiums, projected performance of underlying collateral and other factors involving significant assumptions which may not be reflective of an active market. For certain investments, we use a matrix or model process to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are discounted at an estimated market rate. The pricing matrix incorporates term interest rates as well as a spread level based on the issuer's credit rating, other factors relating to the issuer, and the security's maturity. In some instances issuer-specific spread adjustments, which can be positive or negative, are made based upon internal analysis of security specifics such as liquidity, deal size, and time to maturity.

 Realized and unrealized investment gains and losses presented in the preceding tables represent gains and losses during the time the applicable financial instruments were classified as Level 3. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on Level 3 assets are primarily reported in either net investment income for policyholder and other special-purpose portfolios or investment gains (losses) within the consolidated statement of operations; or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity based on the appropriate accounting treatment for the instrument. The amount presented for gains (losses) included in our net income for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents: (i) the change in the allowance for credit losses for fixed maturities, available for sale; and (ii) changes in fair value of equity securities and trading securities that are held as of the reporting date. The amount presented for gains (losses) included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents changes in the fair value of fixed maturities, available for sale, that are held as of the reporting date. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, percent of our Level 3 fixed maturities, available for sale, were investment grade and percent of our Level 3 fixed maturities, available for sale, consisted of corporate securities.

The calculation of the value of MRBs is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions related to surrenders and utilization of policy benefits. These assumptions are based on actuarial estimates and past experience. Increases in assumed surrender rates would generally increase the value of a MRB asset or decrease the value of a MRB liability (with decreases in assumed surrender rates having the opposite impacts). Increases in utilization rates would generally decrease the value of a MRB asset or increase the value of a MRB liability (with decreases in utilization rates having the opposite impacts).

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 In this section, we review the consolidated financial condition of CNO at September 30, 2024, and its consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and, where appropriate, factors that may affect future financial performance. Please read this discussion in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Our statements, trend analyses and other information contained in this report and elsewhere (such as in filings by CNO with the SEC, press releases, presentations by CNO or its management or oral statements) relative to markets for CNO's products and trends in CNO's operations or financial results, as well as other statements, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

OVERVIEW 
 
 We are a holding company for a group of insurance companies that develop, market and administer health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance and financial services products. We focus on serving middle-income pre-retiree and retired Americans, which we believe are attractive, underserved, high growth markets. We sell our products through exclusive agents, independent producers (some of whom sell one or more of our product lines exclusively) and direct marketing. 
 
 We view our operations as three insurance product lines (annuity, health and life) and the investment and fee income segments. Our segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of profit margins and the way management makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of the business. 
 
 Our insurance product line segments (annuity, health and life) include marketing, underwriting and administration of the policies our insurance subsidiaries sell. The business written in each of the three product categories through all of our insurance subsidiaries is aggregated allowing management and investors to assess the performance of each product category. When analyzing profitability of these segments, we use insurance product margin as the measure of profitability, which is: (i) insurance policy income; and (ii) net investment income allocated to the insurance product lines; less (i) insurance policy benefits and interest credited to policyholders; and (ii) amortization of deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits, non-deferred commissions and advertising expense. Net investment income is allocated to the product lines using the book yield of investments backing the block of business, which is applied to the average insurance liabilities, net of insurance intangibles, for the block in each period. Net insurance liabilities for the purpose of allocating investment income to product lines are equal to: (i) policyholder account balances for annuity products; (ii) total reserves before the fair value adjustments reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), if applicable, for all other products; less (iii) amounts related to reinsured business; (iv) deferred acquisition costs; (v) the present value of future profits; and (vi) the value of unexpired options credited to insurance liabilities. 
 
 Income from insurance products is the sum of the insurance margins of the annuity, health and life product lines, less expenses allocated to the insurance lines. It excludes the income from our fee income business, investment income not allocated to product lines, net expenses not allocated to product lines (primarily holding company expenses) and income taxes. Management believes insurance product margin and income from insurance products help provide a better understanding of the business and a more meaningful analysis of the results of our insurance product lines. 
 
 We market our products through the Consumer and Worksite Divisions that reflect the customers served by the Company. The Consumer and Worksite Divisions are primarily focused on marketing insurance products, several types of which are sold in both divisions and underwritten in the same manner. 
 
 The Consumer Division serves individual consumers, engaging with them on the phone, virtually, online, face-to-face with agents, or through a combination of sales channels. This structure unifies consumer capabilities into a single division and integrates the strength of our agent sales forces with one of the largest direct-to-consumer insurance businesses with proven experience in advertising, web/digital and call center support.

CNO FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 ___________________ 

 The Worksite Division focuses on the sale of voluntary benefit life and health insurance products in the workplace for businesses, associations, and other membership groups, interacting with customers at their place of employment and virtually. The Worksite Division also offers employer benefits services that seek to increase benefits engagement and reduce costs for employers and their employees. These services include: benefit administration technology, year-round advocacy, enrollment, benefits compliance and communications services. 
 
 The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability of this segment is the total net investment income not allocated to the insurance products. Investment income not allocated to product lines represents net investment income less: (i) equity returns credited to policyholder account balances; (ii) the investment income allocated to our product lines; (iii) interest expense on notes payable, investment borrowings and financing arrangements; (iv) expenses related to the FABN program; and (v) certain expenses related to benefit plans that are offset by special-purpose investment income; plus (vi) the impact of annual option forfeitures related to fixed indexed annuity surrenders. Investment income not allocated to product lines includes investment income on investments in excess of amounts allocated to product lines, investments held by our holding companies, the spread we earn from our FHLB investment borrowing and FABN programs and variable components of investment income (including call and prepayment income, adjustments to returns on structured securities due to cash flow changes, income (loss) from COLI and alternative investment income not allocated to product lines), net of interest expense on corporate debt and financing arrangements. The spread earned from our FHLB investment borrowing and FABN programs includes the investment income on the matched assets less: (i) interest on investment borrowings related to the FHLB investment borrowing program; (ii) interest credited on funding agreements; and (iii) amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to the FABN program. 
 
 Our fee income segment includes the earnings generated from sales of third-party insurance products, services provided by Optavise and the operations of our broker/dealer and registered investment advisor. 
 
 Expenses not allocated to product lines include the expenses of our corporate operations, excluding interest expense on debt.

 (a) Management believes that an analysis of net income applicable to common stock before: (i) net realized investment gains or losses from sales, impairments and change in allowance for credit losses, net of taxes; (ii) net change in market value of investments recognized in earnings, net of taxes; (iii) changes in fair value of embedded derivative liabilities and MRBs related to our fixed indexed annuities, net of taxes; (iv) fair value changes related to the agent deferred compensation plan, net of taxes; (v) gains or losses related to material reinsurance transactions, net of taxes; (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt, net of taxes; (vii) changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and other tax items; and (viii) other non-operating items consisting primarily of earnings attributable to VIEs, net of taxes ("net operating income," a non-GAAP financial measure) is important to evaluate the financial performance of the company, and is a key measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. The income tax expense or benefit allocated to the items included in net non-operating income (loss) represents the current and deferred income tax expense or benefit allocated to the items included in non-operating earnings. Management uses this measure to evaluate performance because the items excluded from net operating income can be affected by events that are unrelated to the Company's underlying fundamentals. The table above reconciles the non-GAAP measure to the corresponding GAAP measure. 
 
 In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its budgeting process, financial analysis of segment performance and in assessing the allocation of resources. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance an investor's understanding of our financial performance and allow them to make more informed judgments about the Company as a whole. These measures also highlight operating trends that might not otherwise be apparent. However, net operating income is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, as measures of liquidity, or as an alternative to net income as measures of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, net operating income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Net operating income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Our definition and calculation of net operating income are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Also, as we adopted the new accounting standard related to targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts effective January 1, 2023, we updated our method of determining non-operating earnings for our fixed indexed annuities to better identify the volatile non-economic impacts of that line of business. This resulted in fixed indexed annuity margins that more closely reflect the economics of the business. 

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION 
 
 In 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor (the "DOL") proposed a regulation to change the definition of "fiduciary" for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and parallel provisions of the Code, when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and amendments to various existing prohibited transaction exemptions ("PTEs"), including PTE 84-14, that financial professionals rely on when they make investment recommendations to retirement investors. On April 23, 2024, the DOL finalized and published this new definition of "fiduciary" for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code and finalized and published amendments to these PTEs. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, including by a coalition of insurance industry trade associations that filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the amendments. On July 25 and July 26, 2024, two federal district courts located in the Eastern District of Texas (the E.D. Tex. and the Northern District of Texas (the N.D. Tex. ), respectively, entered stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of "fiduciary" and the amendments to the PTEs. The DOL has appealed the stay issued in the E.D. Tex. litigation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The DOL has also filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the stay issued in the N.D. Tex. litigation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; the parties have jointly agreed to stay further proceedings pending the outcome of the interlocutory appeal. We are monitoring these developments, but do not expect any changes in the definition of "fiduciary" (as currently contemplated) to have a significant impact on our business.

 ____________ 
 (a) Amortization and non-deferred commissions are comprised of: (i) the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits; and (ii) commission expenses that are not directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and, therefore, are not eligible to be deferred. Such non-deferred commissions are included in other operating costs and expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.

 CNO is the top tier holding company for a group of insurance companies that develop, market and administer health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance and financial services products. We view our operations by segments, which consist of insurance product lines. These products are distributed by our two divisions. The Consumer Division serves individual consumers, engaging with them on the phone, virtually, online, face-to-face with agents, or through a combination of sales channels. The Worksite Division focuses on the sale of voluntary benefit life and health insurance products in the workplace for businesses, associations, and other membership groups, interacting with customers at their place of employment and virtually. 
 
 Insurance product margin is management's measure of the profitability of its annuity, health and life product lines' performance and consists of insurance policy income plus allocated investment income less insurance policy benefits, interest credited, commissions, advertising expense and amortization of acquisition costs. Income from insurance products is the sum of the insurance margins of the annuity, health and life product lines, less expenses allocated to the insurance lines. It excludes the income from our fee income business, investment income not allocated to product lines, net expenses not allocated to product lines (primarily holding company expenses) and income taxes. Management believes this information helps provide a better understanding of the business and a more meaningful analysis of the results of our insurance product lines. 
 
 Net investment income is allocated to the product lines using the book yield of investments backing the block of business, which is applied to the average insurance liabilities for the block in each period. Net insurance liabilities for the purpose of allocating investment income to product lines are equal to: (i) policyholder account balances for annuity products; (ii) total reserves before the fair value adjustments reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), if applicable, for all other products; less (iii) amounts related to reinsured business; (iv) deferred acquisition costs; (v) the present value of future profits; and (vi) the value of unexpired options credited to insurance liabilities. Investment income not allocated to product lines represents net investment income less: (i) equity returns credited to policyholder account balances; (ii) the investment income allocated to our product lines; (iii) interest expense on notes payable, investment borrowings and financing arrangements; (iv) expenses related to the FABN program; and (v) certain expenses related to benefit plans that are offset by special-purpose investment income; plus (vi) the impact of annual option forfeitures related to fixed indexed annuity surrenders. Investment income not allocated to product lines includes investment income on investments in excess of amounts allocated to product lines, investments held by our holding companies, the spread we earn from our FHLB investment borrowing and FABN programs and variable components of investment income (including call and prepayment income, adjustments to returns on structured securities due to cash flow changes, income (loss) from COLI and alternative investment income not allocated to product lines), net of interest expense on corporate debt and financing arrangements. The spread earned from our FHLB investment borrowing and FABN programs includes the investment income on the matched assets less: (i) interest on investment borrowings related to the FHLB investment borrowing program; (ii) interest credited on funding agreements; and (iii) amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to the FABN program. 
 
 Comprehensive Annual Actuarial Review: We update the assumptions and experience underlying the expected gross 
 margins for policies accounted for as investment contracts annually. Previously, the review was completed in the fourth quarter of each year, however, we began performing this review in the third quarter starting with 2024 to better align with our annual planning process and third quarter is also more consistent with industry practice. In addition, we also review and update our assumptions on a more frequent basis to the extent current conditions or circumstances warrant changes that could be significant to our operating results. The impacts of these unlocking exercises have had a significant impact on our earnings. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we performed our comprehensive annual actuarial review, including, but not limited to, 
 assumptions related to mortality rates, surrender rates, earned rates, credited rates and expenses. This review resulted in a net favorable impact to insurance product margins included in pre-tax operating income of 27.3 million. 
 
 The most significant impacts related to fixed indexed annuities and Medicare supplement products which were favorably (unfavorably) impacted by 36.2 million and (9.4) million, respectively. The primary fixed indexed annuities changes related to higher mortality assumptions. The primary Medicare supplement changes related to higher morbidity and higher persistency assumptions. 
 
 In addition, the comprehensive annual actuarial review unfavorably impacted pre-tax non-operating income by 42.8 million related to changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities and market risk benefits on our fixed indexed annuities. The primary changes related to higher earned rate assumptions.

 The following table summarizes the impact to pre-tax operating earnings from our comprehensive annual actuarial review in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 (dollars in millions): 
 
 Line of business: Insurance policy benefits Fixed indexed annuities 36.2 Supplemental health .3 Medicare supplement (9.4) Long-term care .9 Traditional life (4.5) Interest-sensitive life 3.8 Favorable impact on pre-tax operating earnings 27.3 

Summary of Operating Results: Net operating income was 119.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 101.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 291.3 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 222.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Insurance product margin was 282.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 240.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 786.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 684.4 million in the first nine months of 2023. Fluctuations by product line are discussed in greater detail in the narratives that follow. 
 
 Total net investment income (comprised of investment income allocated and not allocated to products) increased 7.0 percent to 299.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 279.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, and 7.2 percent to 854.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 797.2 million in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting growth in the investment portfolio and higher yields. The higher yields reflect seven consecutive quarters of new money rates in excess of 6.0 percent. In addition, the yield in 2024 benefited from portfolio optimization trades as we selectively sold certain lower yielding securities and reinvested in higher yielding securities.

 Total allocated and unallocated expenses are summarized in the table below. Expenses not allocated to product lines include certain significant items listed in the table below. Total allocated and unallocated expenses as adjusted for the significant items are summarized below (dollars in millions): 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Expenses allocated to product lines 153.0 153.2 469.2 460.2 Expenses not allocated to product lines 18.5 (7.5) 52.8 31.9 Unfavorable impact related to a fixed asset impairment (2.9) (2.9) Net favorable impact from legal matters 21.7 21.7 Adjusted total 168.6 167.4 519.1 513.8 
 
 Total allocated and unallocated expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were up slightly as compared to the same period in the prior year, and were in line with our expectations. Consistent with our disclosure in the second quarter of 2024, we continue to expect our projected expense ratio for the full year to be between 19.0 percent to 19.2 percent, narrowing the range of our original guidance of between 18.8 percent to 19.2 percent. The expense ratio is defined as total allocated and unallocated expenses divided by the sum of insurance policy income and net investment income allocated to products. 
 
 The fee income segment is summarized below (dollars in millions): 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Fee revenue 29.3 27.9 111.8 108.6 Operating costs and expenses (32.0) (30.8) (102.4) (95.4) Net fee income (2.7) (2.9) 9.4 13.2 
 
 Net fee income showed modest improvement in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023, net fee income decreased primarily due to: (i) changes to our revenue recognition assumptions related to sales of third-party products by our Consumer Division reflecting less favorable policy persistency and higher agent persistency resulting in higher renewal commissions; partially offset by (ii) higher sales of third-party products in the 2024 period. 
 
 Investment income not allocated to product lines generally fluctuates from period to period based on the performance of our alternative investments (which are typically reported a quarter in arrears); the earnings related to the investments underlying our COLI; the spread we earn from our FHLB investment borrowing and FABN programs; the level of trading account income; and the impact of annual option forfeitures related to fixed indexed annuity surrenders. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.7 percent.

 Margin from fixed indexed annuities was 79.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 47.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 172.3 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 141.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. The margin, excluding the net favorable impacts of the annual actuarial review previously discussed, was 42.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, and 136.1 million in the first nine months of 2024. The margins, excluding the impacts of the annual actuarial review, have declined in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to additional amortization resulting from higher surrenders and assumption changes partially offset by increased surrender charge income. Spread income has remained flat period over period as investment income increased due to: (i) growth in the block; (ii) increased new money rates; and (iii) portfolio optimization trades in 2024 which increased the yield; offset by increased credited rates due to surrenders of policies with lower crediting rates. Average net insurance liabilities (policyholder account balances less: (i) amounts related to reinsured business; (ii) deferred acquisition costs; (iii) present value of future profits; and (iv) the value of unexpired options credited to insurance liabilities) were 9,899.4 million and 9,381.0 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 9,764.6 million and 9,280.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, driven by deposits and reinvested returns in excess of withdrawals. The increase in net insurance liabilities results in higher net investment income allocated. The earned yield was 4.68 percent in the third quarter of 2024 up from 4.45 percent in the third quarter of 2023, and was 4.62 percent in the first nine months of 2024 up from 4.37 percent in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting higher portfolio yields. 
 
 Net investment income and interest credited exclude the change in market values of the underlying options supporting the fixed indexed annuity products and corresponding offsetting amount credited to policyholder account balances. Such amounts were 62.1 million and (49.8) million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 225.6 million and 22.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Margin from fixed interest annuities was 7.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 23.6 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 26.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. The slight decrease in margin in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, is driven primarily by additional amortization from higher policy surrenders and a reduction in the size of the block. Average net insurance liabilities were 1,568.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1,603.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, and were 1,575.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1,615.7 million in the first nine months of 2023, driven by withdrawals in excess of deposits and reinvested returns. The decrease in net insurance liabilities results in lower net investment income allocated, however, the earned yield increased to 5.31 percent in the third quarter of 2024 from 5.24 percent in the third quarter of 2023, and to 5.29 percent in the first nine months of 2024 from 5.18 percent in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting higher portfolio yields. 
 
 Margin from other annuities was 4.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 23.3 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 3.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. The margin on this relatively small block of business is sensitive to annuitant mortality related to contracts with life contingencies. An increase in mortality in this block will result in a decrease in insurance liabilities and insurance policy benefits. We experienced elevated annuitant mortality on a small number of closed block payout annuity policies in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024.

 Margin from supplemental health business was 68.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 62.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 199.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 186.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. The margin as a percentage of insurance policy income was 38 percent in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 35 percent in the prior year period, and was 37 percent in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 35 percent in the first nine months of 2023. Margins improved in 2024 from the comparable periods in 2023 due to growth in the block and improved morbidity.

 Our supplemental health products (including specified disease, accident and hospital indemnity products) generally provide fixed or limited benefits. For example, payments under cancer insurance policies are generally made directly to, or at the direction of, the policyholder following diagnosis of, or treatment for, a covered type of cancer. Approximately three-fourths of our supplemental health policies inforce (based on policy count) are sold with return of premium or cash value riders. The return of premium rider generally provides that after a policy has been inforce for a specified number of years or upon the policyholder reaching a specified age, we will pay to the policyholder, or a beneficiary under the policy, the aggregate amount of all premiums paid under the policy, without interest, less the aggregate amount of all claims incurred under the policy. The cash value rider is similar to the return of premium rider, but also provides for payment of a graded portion of the return of premium benefit if the policy terminates before the return of premium benefit is earned. Accordingly, the net cash flows from these products generally result in the accumulation of amounts in the early years of a policy (reflected in our earnings as reserve increases which is a component of insurance policy benefits) which will be paid out as benefits in later policy years (reflected in our earnings as reserve decreases which offset the recording of benefit payments). As the policies age, insurance policy benefits will typically increase, but the increase in benefits will be partially offset by investment income earned on the accumulated assets. 
 
 Margin from Medicare supplement business was 26.3 million and 37.2 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 88.3 million and 95.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The margin, excluding the net unfavorable impacts of the annual actuarial review previously discussed, was 35.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, and 97.7 million in the first nine months of 2024. Claims were slightly higher in the third quarter of 2024 and slightly lower in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Claim experience will fluctuate from period to period. Insurance policy income was 156.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 154.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 463.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 466.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. Higher sales in recent periods have contributed to slightly higher insurance policy income in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Over the last several years, we have experienced a shift in the sale of Medicare supplement policies to the sale of Medicare Advantage policies. We receive fee income when Medicare Advantage policies of other providers are sold, which is recorded in our Fee income segment. We continue to invest in both our Medicare supplement products and Medicare Advantage distribution to meet our customers' needs and preferences. 
 
 Medicare supplement business consists of both individual and group policies. Government regulations generally require we attain and maintain a ratio of total benefits incurred to total premiums earned (excluding changes in policy benefits reserves which is a component of Insurance policy benefits) of not less than 65 percent on individual products and not less than 75 percent on group products. The ratio is determined after three years from the original issuance of the policy and over the lifetime of the policy and measured in accordance with statutory accounting principles. Since the insurance product liabilities we establish for Medicare supplement business are subject to significant estimates, the ultimate claim liability we incur for a particular period is likely to be different than our initial estimate. Changes to our estimates are reflected in insurance policy benefits in the period the change is determined. 
 
 Margin from Long-term care products was 32.9 million and 23.2 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 99.3 million and 66.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The margin as a percentage of insurance policy income was 48 percent in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 35 percent in the third quarter of 2023, and was 49 percent in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 34 percent in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in margin in the 2024 periods is primarily due to growth in the block and lower insurance policy benefits, as compared to the 2023 periods. The margin reflected favorable claim experience in the third quarter of 2024 and in the first nine months of 2024, compared to unfavorable claim experience in the comparable periods in 2023. Claim experience will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Effective October 1, 2024, we discontinued ceding 25 percent of long-term care new business under a reinsurance agreement. We will now retain 100 percent of our long-term care new business. This does not impact the inforce business that we previously ceded. As a result, we expect margins to increase modestly in 2025 and grow more in future years as earnings emerge from the sales.

 Margin from interest-sensitive life business was 28.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 22.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 74.6 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 69.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. The margin, excluding the net favorable impacts of the annual actuarial review previously discussed, was 24.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, and 70.8 million in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in margin, excluding the impacts of the annual actuarial review, in the third quarter of 2024 and in the first nine months of 2024, reflects higher margins compared to the same periods in 2023 due to growth in the business offset by increased claims in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 The interest margin was 0.1 million and 1.0 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was 1.9 million and 2.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net investment income in the 2024 periods was slightly higher than the 2023 periods. The increase in average net insurance liabilities results in higher net investment income allocated, net of the impact of earned yields. The earned yield was 4.97 percent and 4.96 percent in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was 4.98 percent in both the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Interest credited to policyholders may be changed annually but is subject to minimum guaranteed rates and, as a result, any reduction in our earned rate may not be fully reflected in the rate credited to policyholders. 
 
 Net investment income and interest credited exclude the change in market values of the underlying options supporting the fixed indexed life products and corresponding offsetting amount credited to policyholder account balances. Such amounts were 5.5 million and (4.8) million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 20.6 million and 3.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Margin from traditional life business was 35.1 million and 36.9 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was 106.4 million and 95.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The margin, excluding the net unfavorable impacts of the annual actuarial review previously discussed, was 39.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, and 110.9 million in the first nine months in 2024. The increase in margin, excluding the impacts of the annual actuarial review, in the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflects lower advertising expense, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in margin in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reflects lower advertising expense and growth in the block. 
 
 Net investment income in the 2024 periods was comparable to the 2023 periods. The increase in average net insurance liabilities results in higher net investment income allocated, which is largely offset by lower earned yields. The earned yield was 4.68 percent and 4.72 percent in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was 4.69 percent and 4.72 percent in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Advertising expense was 18.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, down from 22.6 million in the comparable period in 2023, and was 64.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, down from 76.8 million in the comparable period in 2023. The demand and cost of television advertising can fluctuate from period to period and tends to spike during presidential election cycles. We are disciplined with our marketing expenditures and will increase or decrease our marketing spend depending on the current economics of the purchase or other factors.

 The above table reconciles net investment income to investment income not allocated to product lines. Investment income not allocated to product lines generally fluctuates from period to period based on the performance of our alternative investments (which are typically reported a quarter in arrears); the earnings related to the investments underlying our COLI; the spread we earn from our FHLB investment borrowing and FABN programs; the level of trading account income; and the impact of annual option forfeitures related to fixed indexed annuity surrenders. 

Net Non-Operating Income (Loss): 
 
 The following summarizes our net non-operating income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):

 Net realized investment losses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 11.1 million and 37.6 million, respectively, net of reductions in the allowance for credit losses of 11.6 million and 17.2 million, respectively. Net realized investment losses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were 20.1 million and 64.1 million, respectively, including the unfavorable change in the allowance for credit losses of 2.3 million and 13.7 million, respectively. 
 
 The change in market value of investments recognized in earnings was an increase (decrease) of 12.3 million and (9.2) million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 29.4 million and (15.1) million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in value will fluctuate from period to period based on market conditions. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a decrease in earnings of 3.5 million, compared to an increase in earnings of 6.8 million in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2023, for the mark-to-market change in the agent deferred compensation plan liability which was impacted by changes in the underlying actuarial assumptions used to value the liability. We recognize the mark-to-market change in the estimated value of this liability through earnings as assumptions change. 
 
 We recognized an increase (decrease) in earnings of (127.1) million and 109.4 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (46.3) million and 94.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting from changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities and MRBs related to our fixed indexed annuities. Excluding the net unfavorable impacts of the annual actuarial review previously discussed, we recognized a decrease in earnings of 84.3 million and 3.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. Such amounts include the impacts of changes in market interest rates and equity impacts used to determine the estimated fair values of the embedded derivatives and MRBs. 
 
 Other non-operating items in the third quarter of 2024 included a charge of 8.3 million primarily related to a five percent workforce reduction and transition costs for outsourcing certain operations activities. At the same time, we are planning to add roles to enhance support of our Consumer and Worksite divisions and that add technology expertise in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. In both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2023, the reinsurance receivables allowance for credit losses increased 1.0 million. The remaining other non-operating items are comprised of earnings attributable to VIEs that we are required to consolidate, net of affiliated amounts. Such earnings are not indicative of, and are unrelated to, the Company's underlying fundamentals.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 2024 Outlook 
 
 We are raising our guidance on operating earnings per diluted share. We currently expect operating earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 3.50 to 3.60, excluding any significant items in the year (up from our original guidance of 3.10 to 3.30 per diluted share). This increase reflects our strong results in the two most recent quarters of 2024. Such guidance also assumes that the returns on our alternative investments are in line with our long-term run-rate assumption for the balance of the year, consistent with our initial guidance assumptions. As consistent with our disclosure in the second quarter of 2024, we continue to expect our projected expense ratio guidance to be between 19.0 percent to 19.2 percent (as compared to our original guidance of between 18.8 percent to 19.2 percent). 
 
 In addition, we are raising guidance on the amount of excess cash to the holding company. We currently expect excess cash flow to the holding company to be in the range of 250 million to 275 million (up from our original guidance of 140 million to 200 million). The increase in guidance is primarily driven by a refinement of our expectations on capital consumption within our insurance subsidiaries. The high end of the prior range assumed there was no material change to the risk profile of our investment portfolio; and there was no significant change to economic conditions and the related pattern of credit migration in our investment portfolio. Both of these variables have remained fairly constant through the third quarter and we expect no significant changes in the fourth quarter. However, if we decide to accept a higher level of risk in our investment portfolio; and/or economic conditions deteriorate, prompting adverse credit migration, then additional capital would be required and excess cash flow would be toward the lower end of the range. 
 
 We expect to continue to manage to: (i) a consolidated RBC ratio of 375 percent for our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries; and (ii) minimum holding company liquidity of 150 million over the long term; although we expect to end 2024 well above those target levels. Our target debt to total capital, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), continues to be in the range of 25 percent to 28 percent. Although our debt to total capital ratio, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), was 32.5 percent at September 30, 2024, we expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Notes for the repayment of our 2025 Notes. At September 30, 2024, adjusting for the expected repayment of the 2025 Notes, the debt to total capital ratio, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), would have been 26.0 percent.

 Our capital structure as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows (dollars in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total capital: Corporate notes payable 1,832.9 1,140.5 Shareholders equity: Common stock 1.0 1.1 Additional paid-in capital 1,715.9 1,891.5 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (1,116.0) (1,576.8) Retained earnings 2,086.9 1,899.8 Total shareholders equity 2,687.8 2,215.6 Total capital 4,520.7 3,356.1 
 
 The following table summarizes certain financial ratios as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Book value per common share 25.86 20.26 Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (a) 36.60 34.68 Debt to total capital ratios: Corporate debt to total capital 40.5 34.0 Corporate debt to total capital, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (a) 32.5 23.1 Corporate debt to total capital, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), as adjusted for the expected repayment of the 2025 Notes (a)(b) 26.0 N/A 
 _____________________ 
 (a) This non-GAAP measure differs from the corresponding GAAP measure presented immediately above, because accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) has been excluded from the value of capital used to determine this measure. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful because it removes the volatility that arises from changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Such volatility is often caused by changes in the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio resulting from changes in general market interest rates rather than the business decisions made by management. However, this measure does not replace the corresponding GAAP measure. 
 (b) This non-GAAP measure has been further adjusted for the expected repayment of the 2025 Notes as previously described above. However, this measure does not replace the corresponding GAAP measure. 
 
 Liquidity for Insurance Operations 
 
 Our insurance companies generally receive adequate cash flows from premium collections and investment income to meet their obligations. Life insurance, long-term care and supplemental health insurance and annuity liabilities are generally long-term in nature. Life and annuity policyholders may, however, withdraw funds or surrender their policies, subject to any applicable penalty provisions; there are generally no withdrawal or surrender benefits for long-term care insurance. We actively manage the relationship between the duration of our invested assets and the estimated duration of benefit payments arising from contract liabilities.

 Three of the Company's insurance subsidiaries (Bankers Life, Washington National and Colonial Penn) are members of the FHLB. As members of the FHLB, our insurance subsidiaries have the ability to borrow on a collateralized basis from the FHLB. We are required to hold certain minimum amounts of FHLB common stock as a condition of membership in the FHLB, and additional amounts based on the amount of the borrowings. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the FHLB common stock was 94.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, collateralized borrowings from the FHLB totaled 2.2 billion and the proceeds were used to purchase variable rate fixed maturity securities with similar durations. The borrowings are classified as investment borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The borrowings are collateralized by investments with an estimated fair value of 2.8 billion at September 30, 2024, which are maintained in custodial accounts for the benefit of the FHLB. 
 
 In 2021, Bankers Life established a FABN program pursuant to which Bankers Life may issue funding agreements to a Delaware statutory trust organized in series (the "Trust") to generate spread-based earnings. Under current authorizations, the maximum aggregate principal amount of funding agreements permitted to be outstanding at any one time under the FABN program is 3 billion. In June and September of 2024, Bankers Life issued funding agreements to a series of the Trust in a principal amount of 750 million and 400 million, respectively. The aggregate principal amount of funding agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 was 2.55 billion. The activity related to the funding agreements is reported in investment income not allocated to product lines. 
 
 State laws generally give state insurance regulatory agencies broad authority to protect policyholders in their jurisdictions. Regulators have used this authority in the past to restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay any dividends or other amounts without prior approval. We cannot be assured that the regulators will not seek to assert greater supervision and control over our insurance subsidiaries' businesses and financial affairs. 
 
 Our estimated consolidated statutory RBC ratio of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries was 388 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 402 percent at December 31, 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, the RBC ratio reflected: (i) our estimated consolidated statutory operating earnings of 33 million; and (ii) insurance company dividends (net of capital contributions) of 112 million that were paid to the holding company. Our RBC ratio at September 30, 2024, exceeded our targeted RBC ratio of 375 percent and the minimum 350 percent that is reflected in our risk appetite statement that we share and discuss with rating agencies and insurance regulators. We believe that the 375 percent RBC ratio target continues to adequately support our financial strength and credit ratings. 
 
 Our insurance subsidiaries transfer exposure to certain risk to others through reinsurance arrangements. When we obtain reinsurance, we are still liable for those transferred risks in the event the reinsurer defaults on its obligations. The failure, insolvency, inability or unwillingness of one or more of the Company's reinsurers to perform in accordance with the terms of its reinsurance agreement could negatively impact our earnings or financial position and our consolidated statutory RBC ratio. 
 
 Financial Strength Ratings of our Insurance Subsidiaries 
 
 Financial strength ratings provided by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's"), S P, AM Best Company ("AM Best") and Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") are the rating agency's opinions of the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay policyholder claims and obligations when due. 
 
 Moody's most recently affirmed its "A3" financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries on July 10, 2024. The outlook for these ratings remains stable. Moody s financial strength ratings range from "Aaa" to "C". These ratings may be supplemented with numbers "1", "2", or "3" to show relative standing within a category. In Moody's view, an insurer rated "A" offers good financial security, however, certain elements may be present which suggests a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. Moody's has twenty-one possible ratings. There are six ratings above the "A3" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and fourteen ratings that are below that rating. 
 
 S P most recently affirmed its "A-" financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries on June 4, 2024. The outlook for these ratings remains stable. S P financial strength ratings range from "AAA" to "R" and some companies are not rated. An insurer rated "A", in S P's opinion, has strong financial security characteristics, but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings. Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category. S P has twenty-one possible ratings. There are six ratings above the "A-" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and fourteen ratings that are below that rating.

On February 15, 2024, AM Best affirmed its "A" financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries and the outlook for these ratings is stable. The "A" rating is assigned to companies that have an excellent ability, in AM Best's opinion, to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. AM Best ratings for the industry currently range from "A++ (Superior)" to "F (In Liquidation)" and some companies are not rated. AM Best has sixteen possible ratings. There are two ratings above the "A" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and thirteen ratings that are below that rating. 
 
 On November 15, 2023, Fitch upgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries to "A" from "A-" and the outlook for these ratings is stable. An insurer rated "A", in Fitch's opinion, indicates a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments and indicates strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. This capacity may, nonetheless, be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings. Fitch ratings for the industry range from "AAA Exceptionally Strong" to "C Distressed" and some companies are not rated. Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category. Fitch has nineteen possible ratings. There are five ratings above the "A" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and thirteen ratings that are below that rating. 
 
 Rating agencies have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews and requested additional information from the companies that they rate, including us. They may also adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their rating models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response. Accordingly, downgrades and outlook revisions related to us or the life insurance industry may occur in the future at any time and without notice by any rating agency. These could increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affect relationships with our distribution channels, reduce new sales, reduce our ability to borrow and increase our future borrowing costs.

 As further described in the note to the consolidated financial statements entitled "Notes Payable - Direct Corporate Obligations", the Company issued the 2034 Notes in May 2024. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Offering of the 2034 Notes, together with cash on hand: (i) for general corporate purposes, which includes the repayment of its 2025 Notes; and (ii) to pay fees, costs and expenses in connection with the foregoing and the Offering.

 CNO and CDOC, Inc. ("CDOC", our wholly owned subsidiary and the immediate parent of Washington National and Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas ("CLTX")) are holding companies with no business operations of their own; they depend on their operating subsidiaries for cash to make principal and interest payments on debt, and to pay administrative expenses and income taxes. CNO and CDOC receive cash from insurance subsidiaries, consisting of dividends and distributions, interest payments on surplus debentures and tax-sharing payments, as well as cash from non-insurance subsidiaries consisting of dividends, distributions, loans and advances. The principal non-insurance subsidiaries that provide cash to CNO and CDOC are 40|86 Advisors, Inc., which receives fees from the insurance subsidiaries for investment services, and CNO Services, LLC which receives fees from the insurance subsidiaries for providing administrative services. The agreements between our insurance subsidiaries and CNO Services, LLC and 40|86 Advisors, Inc., respectively, were previously approved by the domestic insurance regulator for each insurance company, and any payments thereunder do not require further regulatory approval. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, CNO, CDOC and our other non-insurance subsidiaries held 453 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents which was above our minimum target level of 150 million. The higher level of liquidity relative to our target level reflects a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Notes as discussed above. In addition, the holding company has invested 500 million of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Notes primarily into certificates of deposit which are expected to be used for the repayment of the 2025 Notes. 
 
 The ability of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to state insurance department regulations and is based on the financial statements of our insurance subsidiaries prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities, which differ from GAAP. These regulations generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory earned surplus of the insurance company without regulatory approval for any 12-month period in amounts equal to the greater of (or in some states, the lesser of): (i) statutory net gain from operations or net income for the prior year; or (ii) 10 percent of statutory capital and surplus as of the end of the preceding year. However, as each of the immediate U.S. based insurance subsidiaries of CDOC has significant negative earned surplus, any dividend payments from the insurance subsidiaries require the prior approval of the director or commissioner of the applicable state insurance department. In the first nine months of 2024, our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to CDOC totaling 165.0 million. We expect to receive regulatory approval for future dividends from our subsidiaries, but there can be no assurance that such payments will be approved or that the financial condition of our insurance subsidiaries will not change, making future approvals less likely. 
 
 CDOC holds surplus debentures from CLTX with an aggregate principal amount of 749.6 million. Interest payments on those surplus debentures do not require additional approval provided the RBC ratio of CLTX exceeds 100 percent (but do require prior written notice to the Texas Department of Insurance). The estimated RBC ratio of CLTX was 335 percent at September 30, 2024. CDOC also holds a surplus debenture from Colonial Penn with a principal balance of 160.0 million. Interest payments on that surplus debenture require prior approval by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Dividends and other payments from our non-insurance subsidiaries, including 40|86 Advisors, Inc. and CNO Services, LLC, to CNO or CDOC do not require approval by any regulatory authority or other third party. However, insurance regulators may prohibit payments by our insurance subsidiaries to parent companies if they determine that such payments could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders.

 The insurance subsidiaries of CDOC receive funds to pay dividends primarily from: (i) the earnings of their direct businesses; (ii) tax sharing payments received from subsidiaries (if applicable); and (iii) with respect to CLTX, dividends received from subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, the subsidiaries of CLTX had earned surplus (deficit) as summarized below (dollars in millions): 
 Subsidiaries of CLTX Earned surplus (deficit) Additional information Bankers Life (a) Colonial Penn (526.3) (b) 
 ____________________ 
 (a) Bankers Life paid dividends of 105.0 million to CLTX in the first nine months of 2024. Bankers Life may pay dividends without regulatory approval or prior notice for any 12-month period if such dividends are less than the greater of: (i) statutory net income for the prior year; or (ii) 10 percent of statutory capital and surplus as of the end of the preceding year. Dividends in excess of these levels require 30 days prior notice. Since Bankers Life's earned surplus balance is zero, Bankers Life is required to request prior approval from the Illinois Department of Insurance for return-of-capital distributions. 
 (b) The deficit is primarily due to transactions which occurred several years ago, including a tax planning transaction and the fee paid to recapture a block of business previously ceded to an unaffiliated insurer. 
 
 A significant deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of the material subsidiaries of CNO or CDOC for any reason could hinder such subsidiaries' ability to pay cash dividends or other disbursements to CNO and/or CDOC, which, in turn, could limit CNO's ability to meet debt service requirements and satisfy other financial obligations. In addition, we may choose to retain capital in our insurance subsidiaries or to contribute additional capital to our insurance subsidiaries to maintain or strengthen their surplus or fund reinsurance transactions, and these decisions could limit the amount available at our top tier insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding companies. In the first nine months of 2024, CDOC made capital contributions of 53.1 million to CLTX. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under our 250 million Revolving Credit Agreement and there are no scheduled repayments of our direct corporate obligations until May 2025, as referenced above and no subsequent scheduled repayments of our direct corporate obligations until May 2029. 
 
 Free cash flow is a measure of holding company liquidity and is calculated as: (i) dividends, management fees and surplus debenture interest payments received from our subsidiaries; plus (ii) earnings on corporate investments; less (iii) interest expense, corporate expenses and net tax payments. In the first nine months of 2024, we generated 257 million of such free cash flow. The Company expects to deploy its free cash flow into investments to accelerate profitable growth, common stock dividends and share repurchases. The amount and timing of future share repurchases (if any) will be based on business and market conditions and other factors including, but not limited to, available free cash flow, the current price of our common stock and investment opportunities. In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 6.5 million shares of common stock for 190.0 million under our securities repurchase program (including 1.4 million of repurchases settled in the fourth quarter of 2024). The Company had remaining repurchase authority of 331.8 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, dividends declared on common stock totaled 50.8 million 0.47 per common share). In May 2024, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend to 0.16 per share from 0.15 per share. 
 
 Moody's most recently affirmed its "Baa3" rating on our senior unsecured debt on July 10, 2024. The outlook for these ratings remains stable. In Moody's view, obligations rated "Baa" are subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain speculative characteristics. A rating is supplemented with numerical modifiers "1", "2" or "3" to show the relative standing within a category. Moody's has a total of twenty-one possible ratings ranging from "Aaa" to "C". There are nine ratings above CNO's "Baa3" rating and eleven ratings that are below its rating.

 S P most recently affirmed its "BBB-" rating on our senior unsecured debt on June 4, 2024. The outlook for these ratings remains stable. In S P's view, an obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category. S P has a total of twenty-two possible ratings ranging from "AAA (Extremely Strong)" to "D (Payment Default)". There are nine ratings above CNO's "BBB-" rating and twelve ratings that are below its rating. 
 
 On February 15, 2024, AM Best affirmed its "bbb" rating on our issuer credit and senior unsecured debt and the outlook for these ratings is stable. In AM Best's view, a company rated "bbb" has an adequate ability to meet the terms of its obligations; however, the issuer is more susceptible to changes in economic or other conditions. Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category. AM Best has a total of twenty-two possible ratings ranging from "aaa (Exceptional)" to "d (In default)". There are eight ratings above CNO's "bbb" rating and thirteen ratings that are below its rating. 
 
 On November 15, 2023, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings to "BBB" from "BBB-". The outlook for these ratings is stable. In Fitch's view, an obligation rated "BBB" indicates that expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category. Fitch has a total of 21 possible ratings ranging from "AAA" to "D". There are nine ratings above CNO's "BBB" rating and eleven ratings that are below its rating. 
 
 We believe that the existing cash available to the holding company, the cash flows to be generated from operations and other transactions will be sufficient to allow us to meet our debt service obligations, pay corporate expenses and satisfy other financial obligations. However, our cash flow is affected by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including insurance regulatory issues, competition, financial markets and other general business conditions. We cannot provide assurance that we will possess sufficient income and liquidity to meet all of our debt service requirements and other holding company obligations.

 _______________ 
 (a) Investment ratings are assigned the second lowest rating by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSROs") (Moody's, S P or Fitch), or if not rated by such firms, the rating assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC"). NAIC designations of "1" or "2" include fixed maturities generally rated investment grade (rated "Baa3" or higher by Moody's or rated "BBB-" or higher by S P and Fitch). NAIC designations of "3" through "6" are referred to as below-investment grade (which generally are rated "Ba1" or lower by Moody's or rated "BB+" or lower by S P and Fitch). References to investment grade or below-investment grade throughout our consolidated financial statements are determined as described above. 
 (b) Certain structured securities rated below-investment grade by NRSROs may be assigned a NAIC 1 or NAIC 2 designation based on the cost basis of the security relative to estimated recoverable amounts as determined by the NAIC. Refer to the table below for a summary of our fixed maturity securities, available for sale, by NAIC designations. 
 97 

CNO FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 ___________________ 

 The NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity investments of insurers for regulatory and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called NAIC designations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements based on statutory accounting principles. The NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality designations of the NRSROs for marketable fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities. However, certain structured securities rated below investment grade by the NRSROs can be assigned NAIC 1 or NAIC 2 designations depending on the cost basis of the holding relative to estimated recoverable amounts as determined by the NAIC. The following summarizes the NAIC designations and NRSRO equivalent ratings: 
 NAIC Designation NRSRO Equivalent Rating 1 AAA/AA/A 2 BBB 3 BB 4 B 5 CCC and lower 6 In or near default 

A summary of our fixed maturity securities, available for sale, by NAIC designations (or for fixed maturity securities held by non-regulated entities, based on NRSRO ratings) as of September 30, 2024 is as follows (dollars in millions):

 Below-Investment Grade Securities 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the amortized cost of the Company's below-investment grade fixed maturity securities, available for sale, was 1,252.5 million, or 5.0 percent of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio (or 816.4 million, or 3.2 percent, of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio measured on credit quality ratings assigned by the NAIC). The estimated fair value of the below-investment grade portfolio was 1,218.7 million, or 97 percent of the amortized cost. 
 
 Below-investment grade corporate debt securities typically have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Based on historical performance, probability of default by the borrower is significantly greater for below-investment grade corporate debt securities and in many cases severity of loss is relatively greater as such securities are generally unsecured and often subordinated to other indebtedness of the issuer. Also, issuers of below-investment grade corporate debt securities frequently have higher levels of debt relative to investment-grade issuers, hence, all other things being equal, are generally more sensitive to adverse economic conditions. The Company attempts to reduce the overall risk related to its investment in below-investment grade securities, as in all investments, through careful credit analysis, strict investment policy guidelines, and diversification by issuer and/or guarantor and by industry.

 Net Realized and Unrealized Investment Losses 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the 46.3 million of gross realized losses on sales of 1,230.3 million of fixed maturity securities, available for sale, included: (i) 30.9 million related to various corporate securities; (ii) 9.6 million related to commercial mortgage-backed securities; and (iii) 5.8 million related to various other investments. Securities are generally sold at a loss following unforeseen issuer-specific events or conditions or shifts in perceived relative values. These reasons include but are not limited to: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectation that the market value could deteriorate; (iii) our desire to reduce our exposure (or reflect changing perceptions of risk) related to an asset class, an issuer or an industry; (iv) prospective or actual changes in credit quality; (v) better match certain characteristics of our investment portfolio with the corresponding characteristics of our insurance liabilities; (vi) changes in expected portfolio cash flows; or (vii) an opportunity to enhance the projected total return of the portfolio. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2023, we recognized 45.8 million of realized losses on sales of 527.0 million of fixed maturity securities, available for sale, including: (i) 37.8 million related to various corporate securities; (ii) 6.0 million related to commercial mortgage-backed securities; and (iii) 2.0 million related to various other investments. 
 
 The following summarizes the investments sold at a loss during the first nine months of 2024 which had been 
 continuously in an unrealized loss position exceeding 20 percent of the amortized cost basis prior to the sale for the period

 Future events may occur, or additional information may become available, which may necessitate future realized losses in our portfolio. Significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 
 
 The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of those fixed maturities, available for sale, with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024, by contractual maturity. Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties. Structured securities frequently include provisions for periodic principal payments and permit periodic unscheduled payments.

 Our investment strategy is to maximize, over a sustained period and within acceptable parameters of quality and risk, investment income and total investment return through active strategic asset allocation and investment management. Accordingly, we may sell securities at a gain or a loss to enhance the projected total return of the portfolio as market opportunities change, to reflect changing perceptions of risk, or to better match certain characteristics of our investment portfolio with the corresponding characteristics of our insurance liabilities. 
 
 Structured Securities 
 
 At September 30, 2024, fixed maturity investments included structured securities with an estimated fair value of 7.3 billion (or 30.6 percent of all fixed maturity securities). The yield characteristics of structured securities generally differ in some respects from those of traditional corporate fixed-income securities or government securities. For example, interest and principal payments on structured securities may occur more frequently, often monthly. In many instances, we are subject to variability in the amount and timing of principal and interest payments. For example, in many cases, partial prepayments may occur at the option of the issuer and prepayment rates are influenced by a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty, including: the relative sensitivity of prepayments on the underlying assets backing the security to changes in interest rates and asset values; the availability of alternative financing; a variety of economic, geographic and other factors; the timing, pace and proceeds of liquidations of defaulted collateral; and various security-specific structural considerations (for example, the repayment priority of a given security in a securitization structure). In addition, the total amount of payments for non-agency structured securities may be affected by changes to cumulative default rates or loss severities of the related collateral. 
 
 The amortized cost and estimated fair value of structured securities at September 30, 2024, summarized by type of security, were as follows (dollars in millions): 
 Estimated fair value Type Amortized cost Amount Percent of fixed maturities Asset-backed securities 1,578.5 1,535.0 6.5 Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 812.5 826.9 3.5 Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities 1,670.0 1,608.7 6.8 Collateralized loan obligations 1,083.2 1,082.2 4.6 Commercial mortgage-backed securities 2,369.8 2,198.4 9.2 Total structured securities 7,514.0 7,251.2 30.6 
 
 Residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") include transactions collateralized by agency-guaranteed and non-agency mortgage obligations. Non-agency RMBS investments are primarily categorized by underlying borrower credit quality: Prime, Alt-A, Non-Qualified Mortgage ("Non-QM"), and Subprime. Prime borrowers typically default with the lowest frequency, Alt-A and Non-QM default at higher rates, and Subprime borrowers default with the highest frequency. In addition to borrower credit categories, RMBS investments include Re-Performing Loan ("RPL") and Credit Risk Transfer ("CRT") transactions. RPL transactions include borrowers with prior difficulty meeting the original mortgage terms and were subsequently modified, resulting in a sustainable payback arrangement. CRT securities are collateralized by Government-Sponsored Enterprise ("GSE") conforming mortgages and Prime borrowers, but without an agency guarantee against default losses. 
 
 Commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") are secured by commercial real estate mortgages, generally income producing properties that are managed for profit. Property types include, but are not limited to, multi-family dwellings including apartments, retail centers, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, nursing homes, warehouses, and office buildings. While most CMBS have call protection features whereby underlying borrowers may not prepay their mortgages for stated periods of time without incurring prepayment penalties, recoveries on defaulted collateral may result in involuntary prepayments.
