. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, and renewals and betterments are capitalized. 

Costs
and estimated earnings in excess of billings result when either: 1) costs are incurred related to certain claims and unapproved change
orders, or 2) the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage-of-completion accounting
method, but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract. Claims occur
when there is a dispute regarding both a change in the scope of work and the price associated with that change. Unapproved change orders
occur when there is a dispute regarding only the price associated with a change in scope of work. For both claims and unapproved change
orders, the Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, when it is determined that recovery of incurred cost is probable and the amounts
can be reliably estimated. 

Change
in Estimates: 

The
Company s estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed and many factors change during a contract performance period
that result in a change to contract profitability. These factors include, but are not limited to, differing site conditions: availability
of skilled contract labor: performance of major material suppliers and subcontractors: on-going subcontractor negotiations and buyout
provisions: unusual weather conditions: changes in the timing of scheduled work: change orders: accuracy of the original bid estimate:
changes in estimated labor productivity and costs based on experience to date: achievement of incentive-based income targets: and the
expected, or actual, resolution terms for claims. The factors that cause changes in estimates vary depending on the maturation of the
project within its lifecycle. For example, in the ramp-up phase, these factors typically consist of revisions in anticipated project
costs and during the peak and close-out phases, these factors include the impact of change orders and claims as well as additional revisions
in remaining anticipated project costs. Generally, if the contract is at an early stage of completion, the current period impact is smaller
than if the same change in estimate is made to the contract at a later stage of completion. Management focuses on evaluating the performance
of contracts individually and uses the cumulative catch-up method to account for revisions in estimates. Material changes in estimates
are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Diluted
net income (loss) per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive
securities outstanding during the period.

ITEM
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called
 forward-looking statements, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. One can identify these forward-looking
statements by their use of words such as expect, plan, will, may, anticipate, 
 believe, estimate, should, intend, forecast, project 
the negative or plural of these words, and other comparable terminology. One can identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. statements are likely to address the Company s growth strategy, financial results and product and
development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results
to differ from the Company s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other
risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual
future results may vary materially. The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One should carefully
evaluate such statements in light of factors described in the Company s filings with the SEC, especially the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K and the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In various filings the Company has identified important factors
that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. One should understand that it is not possible to predict
or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks
or uncertainties. 

Use
of Terms 

The
following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Unless
the context indicates or suggests otherwise, reference to we , our , us and the Company 
in this section refers to the operations of Dream Homes Development Corporation (DHDC), 

PLAN
OF OPERATION 

 Overview 

Building
on a history of over 2,000 new homes built and over 400 elevation/renovation/addition projects since 1993, the management of Dream Homes
 Development Corporation has positioned the company to emerge as a rapidly growing regional developer of new single and multi-family
subdivisions as well as a leader in coastal new home and modular construction, elevation, Build to Lease and Improved Lots for Sale. 

In
addition to the coastal construction market, Dream Homes continues to pursue opportunities in new single and multi-family home construction,
with 5 developments totaling 367 units in title, or under contract and in development. Dream Homes operations include the development
and sale of residential communities, construction of single-family and multi-family homes, Build to Lease and the development and improvement
of Finished Lots for Sale to national builders. 

New
trends in the real estate market that the Company is actively exploring include Build To Lease properties, as well as developing and
improving building lots and developments to sell finished lots to national home builders. This focus and concentration on building both
single and multi-family developments with the intention to lease or sell them immediately upon completion is being made in response to
several factors. One factor is the extreme shortage of rental properties on the market, not only for first time homemakers, but for retirees,
and young professionals who are unclear as to the intentions of settling in one location. The second factor is the overall lender and
funding source preference to lend to Build To Lease and Improved Lots for sale developments, due to the perception that these 2 avenues
are a safer investment over the long term. Finally, the extraordinary amount of interest from non-traditional sources such as pension
and hedge funds, insurance companies and venture capital firms to purchase completed new For Lease developments at attractive metrics,
as well as the virtually unlimited demand for improved lots from national builders has spurred a large growth in these market segments. 

3 

The
Company has made the decision to change focus to better accommodate these growing trends. Currently 2 new multi-family developments,
which represent a total count of 79 units (of the 367 total units in title or under contract), will be changed from Build For Sale to
Build for Lease. The Company intends to hold these properties upon completion and lease-up for an indeterminate period of time, and realize
the rental income from ownership. This strategy will become a very significant revenue stream for the Company and will become a fourth
division of the Company, behind Finished Lots for Sale, custom new homes and renovation/elevation projects. 

In
addition to the projects which the Company currently has under contract for development, improvement, Build to Lease, and Improved Lots
for Sale, there are a number of properties which the Company has the ability to secure, whether through land contract or other types
of options. These parcels represent significant additional opportunities for development, improvement, Build to Lease, and Improved Lots
for Sale. 

The
Company s business model over the last year has been focused on increasing the new home and new development portion of our business,
until it represents a greater portion of the revenue. New home development, whether Build to Lease or Finished Lots for Sale has a much
greater scalability and growth potential than custom homes or elevation/renovation work. Though the Company has enjoyed stable revenue
in the renovation/elevation portion of the company, the new homes division continues to represent a greater percentage of total revenue. 

Dream
Homes operations include the development and sale of a variety of residential communities, including construction of semi-custom
homes, single and multi-family homes and new home Build to Lease and Improved Lots for Sale. 

Due
to the opportunities afforded by the market conditions, Dream Homes and Development Corporation will continue to pursue opportunities
in the construction and real estate field, specifically in new home Build to Lease and Improved Lots for Sale.
