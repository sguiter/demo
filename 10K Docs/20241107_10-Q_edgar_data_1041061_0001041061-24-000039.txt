 restaurants in more than countries and territories. As of September 30, 2024, of these restaurants were owned and operated by franchisees. The Company s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands are global leaders of the chicken, Mexican-style and pizza categories, respectively. The Habit Burger Grill is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, YUM consisted of operating segments: 
 
 The KFC Division which includes our worldwide operations of the KFC concept 
 The Taco Bell Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Taco Bell concept 
 The Pizza Hut Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Pizza Hut concept 
 The Habit Burger Grill Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Habit Burger Grill concept 
 
 YUM's fiscal year begins on January 1 and ends December 31 of each year, with each quarter comprised of months. The majority of our U.S. subsidiaries and certain international subsidiaries operate on a weekly periodic calendar where the first three quarters of each fiscal year consist of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks in fiscal years with 52 weeks and 17 weeks in fiscal years with 53 weeks. For subsidiaries that operate on this periodic weekly calendar, 2024 will include a 53rd week. Our remaining international subsidiaries operate on a monthly calendar similar to that on which YUM operates. 
 
 Our preparation of the accompanying Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 The accompanying Financial Statements include all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly, when read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K, the results of the interim periods presented. Our results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders' deficit for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
 
 Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of advertising and marketing costs, generally in proportion to revenue, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate.

 KFC restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland. The acquisition creates a significant opportunity to accelerate KFC's growth strategy in the large and growing U.K. and Ireland chicken market. The purchase price to be allocated for accounting purposes of million consisted of cash, net of cash acquired, in the amount of million offset by the settlement of a liability of million related to our preexisting contractual relationship with the franchisee. 
 
 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on management's analysis, including preliminary work performed by third party valuation specialists, as of April 29, 2024. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we adjusted our preliminary estimate of the fair value of net assets acquired.

 We will continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of net assets acquired during the remaining measurement period. 
 
 Reacquired franchise rights, which were valued based on after-royalty cash flows expected to be earned by the acquired restaurants over the remaining term of their then-existing franchise agreements, have an estimated weighted average useful life of 5 years. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary estimated fair value of the net, identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recognized represents expected benefits of the acquisition that do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets. This includes value arising from cash flows expected to be earned in years subsequent to the expiration of the terms of franchise agreements existing upon acquisition. The goodwill is expected to be partially deductible for income tax purposes and has been allocated to our KFC U.K. reporting unit.

 Details of our Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt as of December 31, 2023 can be found within our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 On April 26, 2024, KFC Holding Co, Pizza Hut Holdings, LLC and Taco Bell of America, LLC (collectively, the "Borrowers"), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the refinancing of the then outstanding million under the term loan A facility and billion capacity under the revolving facility through the issuance of a new million term loan A facility (the "Term Loan A Facility") and a billion revolving facility (the "Revolving Facility") pursuant to an amendment to the Credit Agreement (as defined in our 2023 Form 10-K). The transaction did not add any additional net new debt to the Company's Balance Sheet. The amendment also removed the excess cash flow mandatory prepayment requirement with respect to the Term Loan A Facility. 
 
 The refinanced Term Loan A Facility is subject to quarterly amortization payments in an amount equal to of the principal amount of the facility as of the refinance date now beginning with the third quarter of 2025. The Term Loan A Facility quarterly amortization payments increase to of the principal amount of the facility as of the refinance date beginning with the third quarter of 2027. All other material provisions of the Credit Agreement remain unchanged. 
 
 As a result of this refinancing, million of fees were capitalized as debt issuance costs, million of which were paid directly to lenders. During the year to date ended September 30, 2024, previously recorded unamortized debt issuance costs of 
 18 

million were written off and recognized within Interest expense, net due to this refinancing. 
 
 Cash paid for interest during the year to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was million and million, respectively.

 billion. These interest rate swaps have been designated cash flow hedges as the changes in the future cash flows of the swaps are expected to offset changes in expected future interest payments on the related variable-rate debt. There were no other interest rate swaps outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 Gains or losses on the interest rate swaps are reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into Interest expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in the same period or periods during which the related hedged interest payments affect earnings. Through September 30, 2024, the swaps were highly effective cash flow hedges. ) ) ) ) Income tax benefit/(expense) ) ) ) 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated net gain included in AOCI related to our cash flow hedges that will be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months is million, based on current Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") interest rates. 
 
 Total Return Swaps 
 
 We have entered into total return swap derivative contracts, with the objective of reducing our exposure to market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities associated with compensation deferrals into our Executive Income Deferral EID plan. While these total return swaps represent economic hedges, we have not designated them as hedges for accounting purposes. As a result, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings within General and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income largely offsetting the changes in the associated EID liabilities. The fair value associated with the total return swaps as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was not significant. 
 
 As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to risk that the counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions carefully selected based upon their credit ratings and other factors, and continually assess the creditworthiness of counterparties. At September 30, 2024, all of the counterparties to our derivative instruments had investment grade ratings according to the three major ratings agencies. To date, all counterparties have performed in accordance with their contractual obligations. 
 
 See Note 13 for the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities.

 Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
 
 The Company has interest rate swaps and other investments, all of which are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis (see Note 12 for discussion regarding derivative instruments). The following table presents fair values for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the measurements fall. 
 Investments Other assets 3 Interest Rate Swaps Prepaid expenses and other current assets 2 Interest Rate Swaps Other assets 2 
 
 The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps were determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved, including nonperformance risk, and using discount rates appropriate for the duration based on observable inputs. 
 
 Investments as of December 31, 2023, primarily included our approximate minority interest in Devyani International Limited Devyani ), a franchise entity that operates KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in India, with a fair value of million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we sold our ownership interest in Devyani for net proceeds of million and recognized pre-tax investment losses of million related to changes in fair value prior to the date of sale. 

Note 14 -

Lease Guarantees 
 
 As a result of having assigned our interest in obligations under real estate leases as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company-owned restaurants, and guaranteeing certain other leases, we are frequently secondarily liable on lease agreements. These leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in . As of September 30, 2024, the potential amount of undiscounted payments we could be required to make in the event of non-payment by the primary lessee was approximately million. The present value of these potential payments discounted at our pre-tax cost of debt at September 30, 2024, was approximately million. Our franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross-default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non-payment under the lease. We believe these cross-default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases, although such risk may not be reduced in the context of a bankruptcy or other similar restructuring of a large franchisee or group of franchisees. The liability recorded for our expected losses under such leases as of September 30, 2024, was not material. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, real estate, environmental and other matters arising in the normal course of business. An accrual is recorded with respect to claims or contingencies for which a loss is determined to be probable and reasonably estimable. 
 
 India Regulatory Matter 
 
 Yum! Restaurants India Private Limited YRIPL ), a YUM subsidiary that operates KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in India, is the subject of a regulatory enforcement action in India (the Action ). The Action alleges, among other things, that KFC International Holdings, Inc. and Pizza Hut International failed to satisfy certain conditions imposed by the Secretariat for Industrial Approval in 1993 and 1994 when those companies were granted permission for foreign investment and operation in India. The conditions at issue include an alleged minimum investment commitment and store build requirements as well as limitations on the remittance of fees outside of India. 
 
 The Action originated with a complaint and show cause notice filed in 2009 against YRIPL by the Deputy Director of the Directorate of Enforcement DOE of the Indian Ministry of Finance following an income tax audit for the years 2002 and 2003. The matter was argued at various hearings in 2015, but no order was issued. Following a change in the incumbent official holding the position of Special Director of DOE (the Special Director ), the matter resumed in 2018 and several additional hearings were conducted. 

21 

Other Matters 
 
 We are currently engaged in various other legal proceedings and have certain unresolved claims pending, the ultimate liability for which, if any, cannot be determined at this time. However, based upon consultation with legal counsel, we are of the opinion that such proceedings and claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Introduction and Overview 
 
 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis MD A ), should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Statements ), the Forward-Looking Statements and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, 2023 Form 10-K ). All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions of U.S. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Percentages may not recompute due to rounding. 
 
 Yum! Brands, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as the Company, YUM, we, us or our franchise or operate a system of over 60,000 restaurants in more than 155 countries and territories, primarily under the concepts of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit Burger Grill (collectively, the Concepts ). The Company s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands are global leaders of the chicken, Mexican-style and pizza categories, respectively. The Habit Burger Grill, is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. Of the over 60,000 restaurants, 98 are operated by franchisees. 
 
 YUM currently consists of four operating segments: 
 
 The KFC Division which includes our worldwide operations of the KFC concept 
 The Taco Bell Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Taco Bell concept 
 The Pizza Hut Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Pizza Hut concept 
 The Habit Burger Grill Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Habit Burger Grill concept 
 
 Through our Good Growth Strategy we intend to unlock the growth potential of our Concepts and YUM, drive increased collaboration across our Concepts and geographies and consistently deliver better customer experiences, improved unit economics and higher rates of growth. Key enablers include accelerated use of technology and better leverage of our systemwide scale. 
 
 Our global citizenship and sustainability strategy is reflected in our Good agenda, which includes our priorities for social responsibility, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and planet. 
 
 Our Growth agenda is based on four key drivers: 
 Unrivaled Culture and Talent: Leverage our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success 
 Unmatched Operating Capability: Recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences 
 Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands: Innovate and elevate iconic restaurant brands people trust and champion 
 Bold Restaurant Development: Drive market and franchise unit expansion with strong economics and value 
 
 We intend for this MD A to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Throughout this MD A, we commonly discuss the following performance metrics: 
 
 Same-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in system sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the YUM system for one year or more, including those temporarily closed. From time-to-time restaurants may be temporarily closed due to remodeling or image enhancement, rebuilding, natural disasters, health epidemic or pandemic, landlord disputes, boycotts, social or civil unrest or other issues. The system sales of restaurants we deem temporarily closed remain in our base for purposes of determining same-store sales growth and the restaurants remain in our unit count (see below). Same-store sales growth excludes, for subsidiaries operating on a monthly calendar, the extra day resulting from a leap year and excludes, for subsidiaries operating on a weekly periodic calendar, the last week of the year in fiscal years with 53rd weeks. We believe same-store sales growth is useful to investors because our results are heavily dependent on the results of our Concepts' existing store base. Additionally, same-store sales growth is reflective of the strength of our Brands, the effectiveness of our operational and advertising initiatives and local economic and consumer trends. 
 
 Gross unit openings reflects new openings by us and our franchisees. Net new unit growth reflects gross unit openings offset by permanent store closures, by us and our franchisees. To determine whether a restaurant meets the definition of a unit we consider whether the restaurant has operations that are ongoing and independent from another YUM unit, serves the primary product of one of our Concepts, operates under a separate franchise agreement (if operated by a franchisee) and 
 23 

has substantial and sustainable sales. We believe gross unit openings and net new unit growth are useful to investors because we depend on new units for a significant portion of our growth. Additionally, gross unit openings and net new unit growth are generally reflective of the economic returns to us and our franchisees from opening and operating our Concept restaurants. 
 
 System sales and System sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation FX reflect the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned and franchise restaurants. Sales at franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the Company at a rate of 3 to 6 of sales. Increasingly, customers are paying a fee to a third party to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our Concepts' products. We also include in System sales any portion of the amount customers pay these third parties for which the third party is obligated to pay us a license fee as a percentage of such amount. Franchise restaurant sales and fees paid by customers to third parties to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our Concepts' products are not included in Company sales on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income; however, any resulting franchise and license fees we receive are included in the Company's revenues. We believe System sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates our primary revenue drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net new unit growth. 
 
 In addition to the results provided in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America GAAP ), the Company provides the following non-GAAP measurements: 
 
 Diluted Earnings Per Share excluding Special Items (as defined below); 
 
 Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items; 
 
 Core Operating Profit. Core Operating Profit excludes Special Items and FX and we use Core Operating Profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally; 
 
 Company restaurant profit and Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales (as defined below). 
 
 These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 
 
 Special Items are not included in any of our Division segment results as the Company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. Our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of Special Items when assessing segment performance. 
 
 Company restaurant profit is defined as Company sales less Company restaurant expenses, both of which appear on the face of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Company restaurant expenses include those expenses incurred directly by our Company-owned restaurants in generating Company sales, including cost of food and paper, cost of restaurant-level labor, rent, depreciation and amortization of restaurant-level assets and advertising expenses incurred by and on behalf of that Company restaurant. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales Company restaurant margin is defined as Company restaurant profit divided by Company sales. We use Company restaurant profit for the purposes of internally evaluating the performance of our Company-owned restaurants and we believe Company restaurant profit provides useful information to investors as to the profitability of our Company-owned restaurants. In calculating Company restaurant profit, the Company excludes revenues and expenses directly associated with our franchise operations as well as non-restaurant-level costs included in General and administrative expenses, some of which may support Company-owned restaurant operations. The Company also excludes restaurant-level asset impairment and closures expenses, which have historically not been significant, from the determination of Company restaurant profit as such expenses are not believed to be indicative of ongoing operations. Further, while we generally include depreciation and amortization of restaurant-level assets within Divisional Company restaurant expenses used to derive Divisional Company restaurant profit, we record amortization of reacquired franchise rights arising from acquisition accounting within Corporate and Unallocated Company restaurant expenses as such amortization is not believed to be indicative of ongoing Divisional results as well as to enhance comparability of acquired stores' margins with those of existing restaurants. Company restaurant profit and Company restaurant margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry. 
 
 Certain performance metrics and non-GAAP measurements are presented excluding the impact of FX. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the FX impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.

 (a) Due to their size and volatility, we have reflected as Special Items those refranchising gains and losses that were recorded in connection with market-wide refranchisings. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded net refranchising gains of 1 million and 2 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items. During the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded net refranchising losses of 3 million and net refranchising gains of 7 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items. 
 
 Additionally, we recorded net refranchising gains of 11 million and 17 million during quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that have not been reflected as Special Items. During the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded net refranchising gains of 34 million and 33 million, respectively, that have not been reflected as Special Items. These net refranchising gains relate to refranchising of restaurants unrelated to market-wide refranchisings that we believe are indicative of our expected ongoing refranchising activity. 
 
 (b) In April 2023, we completed our exit from the Russia market by selling the KFC business in Russia to Smart Service Ltd. Our GAAP operating results presented herein for the quarter and year to date ended June 30, 2023, reflect revenues from and expenses to support the Russian operations for KFC prior to the date of sale, within their historical financial statement line items and operating segments. However, given our decision to exit Russia and our pledge to direct any future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion to humanitarian efforts, we reclassed such net operating profits or losses from the KFC Division segment results to Unallocated Other income (expense). Additionally, we incurred certain expenses related to the dispositions of the businesses and other one-time costs related to our exit from Russia which we recorded within Corporate and unallocated G A and Unallocated Franchise and property expenses. The resulting net Operating Profit of 2 million and net Operating Loss of 10 million for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023, respectively, have been reflected as a Special Items. 
 
 (c) We recorded charges of 11 million and 57 million during the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 3 million and 13 million during the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to General and administrative expenses and charges of 1 million during both the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 to Other (income) expense related to a resource optimization program. This program has allowed us to reallocate significant resources to accelerate our digital, technology and innovation capabilities to deliver a modern, world-class team member and customer experience and improve unit economics. We recently expanded the program to identify further opportunities to optimize the Company s spending and identify additional, critical areas in which to potentially reallocate resources, both with a goal to enable the acceleration of the Company s growth rate. Costs incurred to date related to the program primarily include severance associated with positions that have been eliminated or relocated and consultant fees. Due to their scope and size, these charges have been reflected as Special Items. 
 
 (d) The below table includes the detail of Special Items Tax Benefit:

 Tax Benefit on Special Items Operating Profit was determined by assessing the tax impact of each individual component within Special Items based upon the nature of the item and jurisdictional tax law. 
 29 

Other Income Tax impacts recorded as Special in the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include benefits related to the reversal of reserves due to the favorable resolution of tax audits in foreign jurisdictions. Such reserves were established in prior years related to income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets originally recorded as Special Items as part of intercompany restructurings of intellectual property. Other Income Tax impacts recorded as Special in the year to date ended September 30, 2023 also include the release of valuation allowances associated with a jurisdiction in which a marketwide refranchising event occurred.

 The following items impacted reported results in 2024 and/or 2023 and/or are reasonably likely to impact future results. See also the Detail of Special Items in this MD A for other items similarly impacting results. 
 
 Middle East Conflict 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, certain of our markets, principally in our KFC and Pizza Hut Divisions, began being impacted by a military conflict in the Middle East region. Our sales continue to be impacted significantly in markets across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. The impact in these markets represented a low single-digit headwind to YUM's overall same-store sales growth in both the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, we believe we have experienced conflict-related impacts in a broader set of markets, though such amounts are difficult to precisely quantify. 
 31 

In a few isolated cases, the scale and duration of these sales impacts are affecting the financial health of our less scaled or less well-capitalized franchisees, particularly those whose restaurants have been most heavily impacted. We have experienced an increase in restaurant closures in those markets most heavily impacted by the Middle East conflict during the first three quarters of 2024. We have approximately 275 restaurants in these markets that are currently temporarily closed as of September 30, 2024. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we defaulted a franchisee who operates a market in the Middle East under the terms of their franchise agreement. The number of units impacted by this default comprise less than 1 of our global store count. 
 
 We are working closely with our franchisees in markets who have been most heavily impacted by the Middle East conflict to improve their profitability and position their businesses for healthy growth in the future. Additionally, we are working with the franchisee who we defaulted subsequent to the quarter end in an attempt to help them cure their default and/or transition their franchise agreement to another party. There is risk that we experience further permanent closures in these markets in the fourth quarter of 2024, which would have a negative impact on our unit growth rate and result in the write-off of cash incentives we have previously provided in connection with these units. Given the lower volume nature of the units most at risk for potential closure, we do not currently anticipate that any ongoing financial impact would be material. The Middle East conflict is ongoing, and its dynamic nature makes it difficult to forecast any impacts on the Company s balance of year 2024 revenues, operating profit, including the impacts of any bad debt expense, and unit count with any certainty. 
 
 Impact of Foreign Currency Translation on Operating Profit 
 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted the translation of our foreign currency denominated Divisional Operating Profit by 3 million and 26 million for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This included a negative impact to our KFC Division Operating Profit of 1 million and 21 million for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We currently expect changes in foreign currency to negatively impact Divisional Operating Profit by approximately 20 to 30 million on a full-year basis. 
 
 Investment in Devyani 
 
 During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we sold our approximate 5 minority investment in Devyani International Limited ("Devyani"), a franchise entity that operates KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in India, for pre-tax proceeds of 104 million. Changes in the fair value of our ownership interest in Devyani prior to the date of sale resulted in pre-tax investment losses of 20 million in the year to date ended September 30, 2024 and pre-tax gains of 16 million and 21 million in the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

KFC Division 
 
 The KFC Division has 31,143 units, 88 of which are located outside the U.S. Additionally, 99 of the KFC Division units were operated by franchisees as of September 30, 2024.

Consolidated Cash Flows 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 1,176 million in 2024 versus 1,155 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Operating Profit before Special Items, a decrease in interest payments and timing of accounts receivable collections, partially offset by higher income tax payments and an increase in payments related to our resource optimization program. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 292 million in 2024 versus 4 million in 2023. The change was primarily driven by outflows in the current year related to the KFC U.K. and Ireland restaurant acquisition, lapping proceeds from the prior year sale of KFC Russia and higher current year purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by current year proceeds arising from the sale of our approximate 5 minority investment in Devyani. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 991 million in 2024 versus 921 million in 2023. The change was primarily driven by higher current year share repurchases offset by lower current year net debt repayments. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have historically generated substantial cash flows from our extensive franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment, and from the operations of our Company-owned stores. Our annual operating cash flows have been in excess of 1.3 billion in each of the past five years and we expect that to continue to be the case in 2024. It is our intent to use these operating cash flows to continue to invest in growing our business and pay a competitive dividend, with any remaining excess then returned to shareholders through share repurchases. To the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash do not cover our anticipated cash needs, we maintain a 1.5 billion Revolving Facility under our Credit Agreement which had 210 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. We believe that our ongoing cash from operations, cash on hand, which was approximately 460 million at September 30, 2024, and availability under our Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements over the next twelve months. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the disclosures made in Item 7 of the Company's 2023 Form 10-K regarding our material cash requirements. Due to the ongoing significance of our debt obligations, we are providing the update below. 
 
 Debt Instruments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 96 , including the impact of interest rate swaps, of our 11 billion of total debt outstanding, excluding the Revolving Facility balance, finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts, is fixed with an effective overall interest rate of approximately 4.5 . We ended the quarter with a consolidated net leverage ratio of 4.1x EBITDA. We continually reassess our optimal leverage ratio to maximize shareholder returns. We target a capital structure which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates, duration and flexibility with diversified sources of liquidity and maturities spread over multiple years. We have credit ratings of BB+ (Standard Poor's)/Ba2 (Moody's). 
 
 The following table summarizes the future maturities of our outstanding long-term debt, excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts, as of September 30, 2024.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard is effective for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024, and subsequent interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We do not anticipate the impact of the standard will result in significant new disclosures for the Company. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which updates income tax disclosure requirements related to the income tax rate reconciliation and requires disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction.

The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our disclosures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Yum! Brands, Inc.: 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of Yum! Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (YUM) as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and shareholders deficit for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of YUM as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders deficit for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 20, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of YUM s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to YUM in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
