the trading price of Registrant as of the date of the Merger. Due to the change in control the accounting acquirer in the merger is BioRegenx,
Inc., a Nevada Corporation the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 805. This acquired
company (Registrant) is accounted for as an acquisition and the activities of the acquired company are included in the consolidated financial
statements starting with the acquisition. Assets and liabilities are reported at the purchase price allocated to the relative fair market
value. The financial information reported before the merger date is that of the accounting acquirer, with adjustments to capital accounts
and share amounts to reflect the surviving company s legal capital structure. The name of the Registrant was changed to BioRegenx,
Inc. (The Company). 

Commensurate with the Merger, the Company effected

The Consolidated Financial Statements (the Financial

on hand in the amount of . In addition, notes payable of are in default. As a result, management has concluded that there
is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm,
in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
in the event the company cannot continue as a going concern. 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until it begins generating positive
cash flow. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory
to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing.

The fair value of each option or warrant grant
is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a private company and lacks company-specific historical and
implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly
traded set of peer companies with characteristics similar to the Company. The expected term of the Company s stock options has been
determined utilizing the simplified method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options. The expected
term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined
by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the
expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is zero, based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does
not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

As of March 8 th , 2024, the date of
the merger, the Company s common shares were publicly traded on the OTC Markets Group exchange. On the date of merger and for subsequent
transactions the fair value of equity instruments are valued with reference to the share price reported on the public exchange. For the
period of January 1, 2024 through March 7, 2024 and during the year ended December 31, 2023, common shares of the Company were not publicly
traded and the Company estimated the fair value of common stock using an appropriate valuation methodology, in accordance with the framework
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities
Issued as Compensation. Each valuation methodology includes estimates and assumptions that require the Company s judgment. These
estimates and assumptions include a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions, guideline public
company information, the prices at which the Company sold its common stock to third parties in arms length transactions, the rights
and preferences of securities senior to the Company s common stock at the time, and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event
such as an initial public offering or sale. Significant changes to the assumptions used in the valuations could result in different fair
values of stock options at each valuation date, as applicable.

At the date of the acquisition and as of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management has not yet finalized its valuation analysis. The fair values of
the assets acquired, as set forth below, are considered provisional and subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained
through the purchase price measurement period (a period of up to one year from the closing date). Any prospective
adjustments would change the fair value allocation as of the acquisition date. The Company is still in the process of reviewing
underlying models, assumptions and discount rates used in the valuation of provisional goodwill and intangible assets. The following

of grant and one third each of the next two years. No warrants have been issued under this grant and no compensation expense has been
recognized. 

Company disputes and other claims 

The Company is involved in disputes with certain
parties, including parties that are former officers and board members and vendors associated with their activities. Such disputes arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of conducting business. The disputes including matters involving amounts due to the Company,
contract performance standards, and liabilities under contracts or arrangements entered by the prior officers including with parties related
to them. The Company records a liability when a particular contingency is probable and estimable. The Company faces contingencies that
are reasonably possible to occur; however, they cannot currently be estimated. While assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of these
disputes, management does not currently believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate are estimable or probable
and is therefore unable to represent whether they would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. It is reasonably possible that a change in the contingencies could result in a change in the amount recorded
by the Company in the future.

Management intends to raise additional debt or
equity financing to fund ongoing operations and for necessary working capital. However, there is no assurance that such financing plans
will be successful or be obtained in amounts sufficient to meet the Company s needs. 

Notwithstanding, the Company anticipates generating
losses and therefore may be unable to continue operations in the future. The Company anticipates it will require additional capital in
order to develop its business. The Company may use a combination of equity and/or debt instruments or enter into a strategic arrangement
with a third party. Management has yet to find a solution to its funding requirements. 

The Company, through certain subsidiaries, financed
past activities, in part, with borrowing from private parties, Small Business Administration s Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL)
and related parties. 

Loans from unrelated parties are as follows:

(A) The first Howard note was advanced on 06/28/2016
and the second on 04/03/2017 to Microvascular Health Solutions, LLC. Both notes had one-year terms and both notes are in default. The
stated interest rate on each note was 2.5 per month, upon default the interest rate increased to 3.5 per month. The notes are secured
by the accounts receivable of the borrower. At year end after the default each note contained a provision entitling the lender to 5 ownership
in the borrower, a consolidated subsidiary. The Company estimates that if the interest in the subsidiary were converted into its common
shares it would represent an equivalent of 29,400,000 common shares, which would only be issuable in lieu of the interest in the subsidiary,
if agreed upon by the Company. 

29 

(B) The Goff note had a maturity date of February
13 th , 2016, the note is in default. The original note advanced 15,000 and called for a payment of 22,500 on the maturity
date. The note provides for a 4 interest rate per annum after the maturity date. 

(C) Insurance note is from a finance company that
provided short term financing of insurance premiums. The note bears and interest rate of 15.97 and require ten installments. The balance
will mature at April 30th, 2025. 

(D) In January of 2024, the Company issued two
notes for 165,000 each, Alder and Genisis Glass. The notes are due in twelve months from the note date or before if the company brings
in equity equal to 1,500,000. The funds were designated for the improvement of the technical infrastructure of the newly acquired DocSun
Biomedical Holdings, Inc. Each note was issued with a 15,000 original issue discount. Loan fees of 1,000 plus 4,500 common shares with
a fair value of 9,990 were paid to each lender. The amounts recorded are net of unamortized discounts of 8,376 each consisting of the
original discount and fair value of shares issued. 

(E) EIDL Notes 

The principal amount of economic injury disaster
loans (EIDL) issued under the Small Business Administration s COVID-19 recovery program was 150,000 and 350,000 at September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the long-term balance of the EIDL loans was 150,000 and the current
balance for delinquent loans was 400,000. The total balance is comprised of three notes made by subsidiaries of the Company, secured
by the assets of the Company. One of which was acquired in the merger with Findit, inc. and is in charge off status at the SBA. The Findit
EIDL loan and the other 200,000 subsidiary loan are in default and shown as current liabilities. Each loan has a 30-year term and an
interest rate of 3.75 per annum. The SBA granted a total of thirty months payment deferment period under the EIDL program for Covid-19
related loans, both EIDL loans qualified for and used the full deferment period. Interest continued to accrue during the deferment period
and the deferred amounts will be paid as a balloon payment at the end of the 30-year amortization period. Current payments are being applied
against interest accrued. The notes maturity dates are May 17, 2050 for a 150,000 note, July 12, 2051 for a 200,000 note and July 17,
2050 for the Findit EIDL loan. 

(F) The convertible notes have a stated interest
rate of 16 , of which 10 is payable by adding to the principal of the note and 6 is payable in cash, biannually. The notes are convertible
into common shares at the option of the noteholder at 0.09 cents per common share. The notes mature 2 years after the note date. The Company
has the option to convert the convertible notes in the event of an uplift to a national stock exchange. The conversion price to the Company
is the lessor of 0.09 cents or 85 of the price at on the national exchange. For each 5,000 principal of the notes, the Company granted
2,500 warrants to purchase common stock at 0.20 cents per common share. The warrants expire 2 years after the Company s shares are
listed on an internationally recognized exchange. As of September 30, 2024, four notes were issued for proceeds totaling 130,000. A total
of 65,000 warrants with a fair value of 1,284 were paid in relation to the note proceeds. The amounts recorded are net of unamortized
discounts of 1,101 consisting of the fair value of the warrants granted. A total of 3,361 interest is included in the loan balances.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not required for a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily
applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable
assurance regarding management s control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our
CEO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the period ended September
30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the
identification material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. 

Management s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective
internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

31 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. Our
management concluded we have the following material weaknesses . A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Ineffective Control Environment. The
Company did not maintain an effective control environment, which is the foundation necessary for effective internal control over financial
reporting. Specifically, the Company (i) did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee; (ii) did not have its Board of Directors
review and approve significant transactions; (iii) had an insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control
design, execution and monitoring activities; (iv) had an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge
and experience and ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements commensurate with the Company s
financial reporting requirements; (v) had inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (vi) lack of written
documentation of the Company s key internal control policies and procedures over financial reporting. The Company is required under
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have written documentation of key internal control over financial reporting. The Company did
not formally document policies and controls to enable management and other personnel to understand and carry out their internal control
responsibilities including the lack of closing checklists, budget-to-actual analyses, balance sheet variation analysis, and pro-forma
financial statements. Additionally, the Company did not have an adequate process in place to complete its testing and assessment of the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner; 

Ineffective controls over financial statement
close and reporting process. The Company did not maintain effective controls over its financial statement close and reporting
process. Specifically, the Company: (i) had insufficient preparation and review procedures for disclosures accompanying the Company s
financial statements; and (ii) did not provide reasonable assurance that accounts were complete and accurate and agreed to detailed support
and that reconciliations of accounts were properly performed, reviewed and approved; and 

Insufficient segregation of duties in our finance
and accounting functions due to limited personnel. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions.
During the period ended September 30, 2024, we had limited personnel that performed nearly all aspects of our financial reporting process,
including, but not limited to, access to the underlying accounting records and systems, the ability to post and record journal entries
and responsibility for the preparation of the financial statements. Due to the fact that these duties were often performed by the same
person, this creates a lack of review over the financial reporting process that would likely result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets,
calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies
could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

As of the date of this report, our remediation
efforts continue related to each of the material weaknesses that we have identified in our internal control over financial reporting,
and additional time and resources will be required in order to fully address these material weaknesses. We have not been able to complete
all actions necessary and test the remediated controls in a manner that would enable us to conclude that such controls are effective.
We are committed to implementing the necessary controls to remediate the material weaknesses described below as our resources permit.
These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until (1) the new processes are designed, appropriately controlled and implemented
for a sufficient period of time and (2) we have sufficient evidence that the new processes and related controls are operating effectively. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances
of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

32 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

33 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently involved in any legal proceeding
or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party or
to which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 

We are involved in disputes with certain parties,
including parties that are former officers and board members and vendors associated with their activities. Such disputes arise from time
to time in the ordinary course of conducting business. While assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of these disputes, management
does not currently believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate are estimable or probable and is therefore unable
to represent whether they would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
