Fee Income The Company may receive various fees in the ordinary course of business such as structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication and commitment fees as well as fees for managerial assistance rendered by the Company to the Portfolio Companies.

of its investment company taxable income as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company (among other requirements) intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from corporate-level income taxes. For income tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. The tax character of distributions paid to stockholders may include return of capital, however, the exact amount cannot be determined until we file Form 1099s. The character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from U.S. GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividend and distributions and other permanent book and tax difference are reclassified to Additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. If we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least of our annual ordinary income for the calendar year and of our capital gain net income for the 1-year period ending on October 31 in that calendar year, we will generally be required to pay excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the year.

term and thereafter will continue for successive annual periods provided that such continuance is specifically approved annually by a majority of the Board of Directors or by the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the independent directors. , by our Board of Directors, or by vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, on the one hand, or by the Investment Adviser, on the other hand. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment within the meaning of the Investment Company Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations. The Company will pay the Investment Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the stockholders. Management Fee The management fee will be payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of our net assets. The management fee will be calculated based on the average value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. Net assets means the Company s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Investment Adviser has voluntarily agreed to cap the management fee at an annual rate of of the value of our net assets for the first twelve-month period following the Company s initial closing through December 6, 2024. Incentive Fee The incentive fee will consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of our income and a portion is based on a percentage of our capital gains, each as described below. The Investment Adviser has agreed to waive both components of the incentive fee for the first twelve-month period following the initial closing through December 6, 2024. (1) Incentive Fee Based on Income The portion of the incentive fee that is based on a percentage of our income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from Portfolio Companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under our Administration Agreement with our Administrator, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and any stockholder servicing and/or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash.

per quarter annualized). We will pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: per quarter annualized) ; 

 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.00 as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with approximately of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 

 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Investment Adviser. 

 These calculations are prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any shares issued or repurchased during the relevant quarter. (2) Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar quarter in arrears. The amount payable equals: of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. We will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Investment Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act, including Section 205 thereof. The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. For the avoidance of doubt, the incentive fee will be calculated net of our expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million and million , respectively, of management fees, and million and million , respectively, of incentive fees before the impact of waived fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million , respectively, of management fees were waived, and million and million , respectively, of incentive fees were waived. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management fees payable were million and million , respectively. Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement On December 6, 2023, the Company entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser (i) has agreed to pay a portion of the Company s Other Operating Expenses (as defined below) to the effect that such expenses do not exceed 1.00 (on an annualized basis) of the Company s net asset value NAV ), and (ii) may elect to pay an additional portion of the Company s expenses from time to time (each such payment, a Voluntary Expense Payment , and together with (i), Expense Payments ). Other Operating Expenses means the Company s total organizational and offering expenses, including the organizational and offering expenses in connection with the formation of the Company and the initial closing of the private offering that were incurred prior to the commencement of operations, and all other costs and expenses relating to the Company s operations and transactions, excluding the management fee and the incentive fee, interest, fees and other expenses of financings, taxes, and extraordinary expenses, such as litigation and other expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Company s business. Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess referred to in the Expense Support Agreement as Excess Operating Funds ), the Company will pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Investment Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Investment Adviser to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company under the Expense Support Agreement are referred to as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company s net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) the Company s net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of investments in Portfolio Companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar month will equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such month and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Investment Adviser to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such 

 17 

. The Company s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment will automatically become a liability of the Company on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent the Investment Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month. During three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Investment Adviser provided million and million of expense support, respectively (including million and million , respectively, of Voluntary Expense Payments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024). The Company did not have any obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment as of September 30, 2024. The cumulative amount incurred from the commencement of operations subject to future potential reimbursement i s million. Either the Company or the Investment Adviser may terminate the Expense Support Agreement at any time, with or without notice, without the payment of any penalty, provided that any Expense Payments that have not been reimbursed by us to the Investment Adviser will remain the obligation of the Company following any such termination, subject to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. Co-Investment Exemptive Relief Together with the Investment Adviser, we received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us to participate in co-investment transactions with certain affiliates of the Investment Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates in transactions that involve the negotiation of certain terms of the securities or loans to be purchased (in addition to price-related terms), subject to certain terms and conditions. Co-investment transactions involving the negotiation of only price-related terms will be entered into in reliance on SEC staff no-action letters. We intend to co-invest, from time to time, with other Accounts (as defined below) (including co-investment or other vehicles in which the Investment Adviser or its personnel invest and that co-invest with such other Accounts) in portfolio investments that are suitable for both the Company and such other Accounts. Accounts means Jefferies Finance s own accounts, accounts of Jefferies Finance s clients, including separately managed accounts (or separate accounts), pooled investment vehicles and collateralized loan obligations that are sponsored, managed or advised by Jefferies Finance or other Affiliate Investment Advisers (as defined below). Affiliate Investment Advisers means Accounts advised by our Investment Adviser or investment advisers that are affiliated with us. Even if the Company and such other Accounts invest in the same securities, conflicts of interest may still arise. For example, it is possible that as a result of legal, tax, political, regulatory, accounting or other considerations, the terms of such investment (including with respect to price and timing) for the Company and/or such other Accounts may not be the same. Additionally, the Company and/or such other Accounts may have different expected termination dates and/or investment objectives (including target return profiles) and the Investment Adviser, as a result, may have conflicting goals with respect to the price and timing of disposition opportunities. Placement Agreement On October 19, 2023, the Company entered into a placement agreement (as amended on April 25, 2024, the Placement Agreement among the Company, the Investment Adviser, Jefferies Credit Partners LLC JCP ), the parent company of the Investment Adviser, and Jefferies (the Placement Agent ), pursuant to which the Investment Adviser engaged Jefferies as the placement agent for the sale of the Company s shares of common stock. The Placement Agent agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit purchasers for shares of the Company s common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Placement Agreement. Any fees or expenses payable to the Placement Agent under the Placement Agreement are the sole responsibility of JCP or the Investment Adviser, as applicable. The Company and the Investment Adviser have each jointly and severally agreed to indemnify the Placement Agent under the Placement Agreement subject to the terms and conditions thereunder. The Placement Agreement also contains representations, warranties and other provisions customary for transactions of this nature. Due to Investment Adviser Prior to the commencement of operations on December 7, 2023, the Investment Adviser bore all organization and offering expenses in connection with the formation of the Company and the initial closing of the private offering. Following the commencement of operations, the Company will reimburse the Investment Adviser for these organization and offering costs up to a maximum aggregate amount of million. Due to Investment Adviser of approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities includes primarily the reimbursement amount owed for organization and offering costs. Trademark Sub-License Agreement We have entered into a License Agreement with JFIN, a Delaware limited liability company, that grants us a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to the use of the trademark, service mark and trade name Jefferies and all variations thereof.

Yield analysis 
 
 Discount rate 

(1) 

The significant unobservable input used in the yield analysis is the discount rate based on comparable market yields. Significant increases or decreases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

Distributions The Board authorizes and declares distribution amounts per share. 

Dividend Reinvestment Plan We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends or other distributions authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Company on behalf of stockholders who affirmatively elect to reinvest their dividends or other distributions. As a result, if the Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then stockholders who have elected to participate in our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. Of the total distributions paid during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , million was reinvested by stockholders. Share Repurchase Program At the discretion of our Board of Directors, the Company has commenced a share repurchase program in which it intends to repurchase the Company s common shares in an amount up to of the Company s NAV, calculated as of the prior calendar quarter. The Board of Directors may amend or suspend the share repurchase program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. Should the Board of Directors suspend the share repurchase program, the Board of Directors will consider whether the continued suspension of the program is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders on a quarterly basis. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. Under the share repurchase plan, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers on or around the last business day of that quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by shareholders who tender common shares, the Company will repurchase a pro rata portion of the Common Shares tendered by each shareholder based on the aggregate net asset value of the tendered shares by each shareholder. On October 1, 2024, the Company commenced its initial tender offer to purchase common shares in an amount up to of the Company s NAV as of June 30, 2024 that are tendered by shareholders by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 29, 2024 and not withdrawn. No shareholders tendered by the deadline.

Overview 
 We are a private, perpetually offered, externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company, which has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). We are externally managed by the Investment Adviser, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Investment Adviser is registered as investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. 
 We have entered into an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser, under which we have agreed to pay the Investment Adviser a management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. We have entered into an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with Alter Domus (US) LLC (the Administrator ), under which we pay the Administrator fees for its services in addition to reimbursing the Administrator for all reasonable expenses. 
 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in senior secured loans to U.S. companies in the upper middle market. We generally use the term upper middle market to refer to large companies with annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, greater than 75 million. However, we may from time to time invest in smaller companies. We focus on companies backed by private equity sponsors and our capital is typically used by companies to support business growth, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, refinancing or recapitalizations, and other related activity. 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on senior secured first lien loans of private U.S. companies. Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the expected return on new investments, the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold. In the future, we may generate revenue from dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. The debt we invest in will typically not be rated by any rating agency, but if it were, it is likely that such debt would be below investment grade. In addition, we may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized as additional interest income over the life of the related loan. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee and the incentive fee (each of which is described below) to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest, fees and other expenses of financings and other operating and overhead related expenses. The management fee and incentive fees compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments.

 Prior to the commencement of operations on December 7, 2023, our Investment Adviser and its affiliates bore all organization and offering expenses in connection with our formation and the initial closing of the private offering. We will reimburse the Investment Adviser for all such expenses that it incurs on our behalf up to a maximum aggregate amount of 4.0 million in connection with our formation and the initial closing of the private offering, and the Investment Adviser has agreed to bear all such organization and offering expenses that were incurred prior to the commencement of operations in excess of 4.0 million. In all cases, placement or similar fees incurred in connection with the sales of our common stock are not considered organization or offering costs and will be borne by our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. Following the commencement of operations, we will be responsible for all organization and offering expenses. Organization and offering costs incurred prior to the commencement of operations totaled 3.6 million. 
 Upon commencement of operations, organization expenses incurred were expensed, and our initial offering costs (other than the organization expenses) are being amortized over a twelve-month period beginning with the commencement of our operations. 
 From time to time, our Investment Adviser, our Administrator, or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Investment Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 We have entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Investment Adviser. For additional information see Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. 
 Our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with our risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as described in Note 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. 
 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same to estimate the price when an orderly transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). 
 ASC 820 establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instruments and their specific characteristics. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value. The levels used for classifying investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. 
 30 

The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined as follows: 
 Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments included in Level 1 include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. 
 Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs. 
 Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately held entities and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 
 The Company s board of directors (the Board of Directors or the Board has designated the Investment Adviser as its Valuation Designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, and in that role, the Investment Adviser is responsible for performing fair value determinations relating to all of the Company s investments, including periodically assessing and managing any material valuation risks and establishing and applying fair value methodologies, in accordance with valuation policies and procedures that have been approved by the Company s Board of Directors. Even though the Company s Board of Directors designated the Company s Investment Adviser as Valuation Designee, the Company s Board of Directors continues to be responsible for overseeing the processes for determining fair valuation. 
 The majority of our investments are expected to fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not expect that there will be readily available market values for most of the investments which will be in our portfolio, and we will value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee under the direction of the Board of Directors using a documented valuation policy, described below, and a consistently applied valuation process. The factors that may be taken into account in pricing the investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the Portfolio Company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, and the markets in which the Portfolio Company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. Available current market data are considered such as applicable market yields and multiples of publicly traded securities, comparison of financial ratios of peer companies, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal market, and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Valuation Designee will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise its valuation. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, the valuation procedures adopted by our Board of Directors contemplates a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each Portfolio Company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser, the Valuation Designee, responsible for the Portfolio Company or investment; 

(2) We engage an Independent Valuation Adviser to provide independent valuations of the investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment. The Independent Valuation Adviser independently values such investments using quantitative and qualitative information provided by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser as well as any market quotations obtained from independent pricing services, brokers, dealers or market dealers. The Independent Valuation Adviser also provides analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Independent Valuation Adviser provides an opinion on a final range of values on such investments to the Valuation Designee. The Independent Valuation Adviser defines fair value in accordance with ASC 820 and utilize valuation techniques including the market approach, the income approach or both; 

(3) The Independent Valuation Adviser s preliminary valuations are reviewed by our Investment Adviser, in its capacity as the Valuation Designee. The Independent Valuation Adviser s ranges are compared to our Investment Adviser s valuations to ensure our Investment Adviser s valuations are reasonable; 

(4) The Valuation Designee determines the valuations of our investments in good faith, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, based on the input of the Independent Valuation Adviser, and provides the valuation determinations to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors; 

(5) The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews valuation information provided by the Valuation Designee and the Independent Valuation Adviser. The Audit Committee then will discuss such valuation determinations; and 

(6) Our Board of Directors further discusses the valuation determinations of the Valuation Designee, based on the input of the Independent Valuation Adviser. 

We do not intend to issue common stock at a purchase price below the then-current NAV per share, except as permitted by Section 23 under the Investment Company Act. 
 When our NAV is determined other than on a quarter-end (such as in connection with issuances of common stock on dates occurring mid-quarter), it is determined by our Investment Adviser, acting under delegated authority from, and subject to the supervision of, our Board of Directors and in accordance with procedures adopted by our Board of Directors.

Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act was recently adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for appointing a valuation designee and determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the Investment Company Act. Our valuation procedures comply with the new rule s requirements .

Interest and other financing expenses 
 Total interest expense (including unused fees and amortization of deferred financing and debt issuance costs) of 6.6 million and 14.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by 290.2 million and 193.1 million, respectively, of average borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

The Investment Adviser has agreed to cap the management fee at an annual rate of 0.50 of the value of our net assets for the first twelve-month period following the commencement of operations, which resulted in a waiver of 0.4 million and 1.1 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Incentive fees 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total incentive fees were 0.7 million and 1.9 million, respectively.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through our continuous offering of common stock and debt offerings, the Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and receipt of investment principal and interest. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had one Senior Secured Credit Facility outstanding with a maximum available amount of 500 million that is committed to increase to 800 million on June 7, 2025. We may enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities, including debt securitizations and unsecured debt. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the Investment Company Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness is at least 150 . 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowing capacity under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations in the near term. 
 Cash Equivalents 
 Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments, including money market funds, not held for resale with original maturities of three months or less. 
 Restricted Cash 
 Restricted cash includes the amount of principal and interest collections received as well as amounts in reserve to fund draws on the Senior Secured Credit Facility that are all held at JCP BDC SPV I LLC. 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of 371.8 million of debt outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility matures on December 7, 2028, unless there is an earlier termination or an acceleration following an event of default.

The Company adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends or other distributions authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Company on behalf of stockholders who affirmatively elect to reinvest their dividends or other distributions. As a result, if the Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then stockholders who have elected to participate in our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Of the total distributions paid during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 0.5 million was reinvested by stockholders. 
 To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. Although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investments. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 At the discretion of our Board of Directors, the Company has commenced a share repurchase program in which it intends to repurchase the Company s common shares in an amount up to 5 of the Company s NAV, calculated as of the prior calendar quarter. The Board of Directors may amend or suspend the share repurchase program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. Should the Board of Directors suspend the share repurchase program, the Board of Directors will consider whether the continued suspension of the program is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders on a quarterly basis. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the share repurchase plan, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers on or around the last business day of that quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. 
 If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by shareholders who tender common shares, the Company will repurchase a pro rata portion of the Common Shares tendered by each shareholder based on the aggregate net asset value of the tendered shares by each shareholder. 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company commenced its initial tender offer to purchase common shares in an amount up to 5.0 of the Company s NAV as of June 30, 2024 that are tendered by shareholders by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 29, 2024 and not withdrawn. No shareholders tendered by the deadline. 
 Equity 
 The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share. 
 On March 3, 2023, Jefferies Credit Partners LLC, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, purchased 290,100 shares of common stock of the Company for 1,000 (100 shares of common stock of the Company prior to the forward stock split discussed below). On December 6, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors approved a forward stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock by way of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record as of December 6, 2023 was entitled to receive 2,901 shares for each share of the Company held by such shareholder. 
 Shares of our common stock will be issued by us on a continuous basis at a price per share generally equal to our next calculated NAV per share.

Item 3. Qu antitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of elevated interest rates in response to inflation and significant volatility in the financial markets due to the Russian/Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, has materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. For additional information concerning potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Investment Valuation Risk 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value most of our portfolio investments at fair value based on, among other things, the input of our management and audit committee and the independent valuation firm that has been engaged at the direction of our Board of Directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation. The Board of Directors has designated the Investment Adviser as its Valuation Designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, and in that role, the Investment Adviser is responsible for performing fair value determinations relating to all of the Company s investments, including periodically assessing and managing any material valuation risks and establishing and applying fair value methodologies, in accordance with valuation policies and procedures that have been approved by the Company s Board of Directors. Even though the Company s Board of Directors designated the Company s Investment Adviser as Valuation Designee, the Company s Board of Directors continues to be responsible for overseeing the processes for determining fair valuation. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates and Fair Value Measurements as well as Notes 2 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements, for more information relating to our investment valuation. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund, and continue to expect to fund, a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is, and is expected to continue to be, affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, on a fair value basis, 99.9 of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which are SOFR based and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates, and substantially all are subject to certain floors. Our Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at a Term SOFR or a Base Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin equal to 2.70 for borrowings that reference Term SOFR and 1.70 for borrowings that reference the Base Rate. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 The following table shows the estimated annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate flows for variable rate instruments) to our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure (in thousands):

We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time-to-time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments.

Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
