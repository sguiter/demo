 Peak Housing Financing Prior to 2024, the Company provided a mezzanine loan to the portfolio owner in Peak JV 3, which is owned through a joint venture between the Company and the operating partnership of Peak Housing REIT (the Peak REIT OP ). The entity through which the Company provided the loan (the lender-entity) and the entity to which the loan was provided (the property owner) consolidate into the Company s financial statements. As such, the loan receivable balance and the loan payable balance, and the loan interest income and loan interest expense attributable to the Company, are eliminated through consolidation on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations, respectively. The Company (as lender entity) recognizes Peak REIT OP s portion of interest expense on the loan as income and this amount is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The mezzanine loan was to mature on June 30, 2024; however, on May 22, 2024, the property owner delivered written notice to the Company of its intention to exercise the loan s final extension option, extending the maturity date to December 30, 2024. The loan can be prepaid without penalty. At December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the loan provided by the Company was million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, proceeds from the sales of units in the Peak JV 3 portfolio (refer to Note 4 for further information) have been used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan to million at September 30, 2024. Wayford at Pringle Loan Financing On January 10, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to provide a loan in the maximum aggregate amount up to million (the Pringle Loan to an unaffiliated, third-party borrower to acquire build-to-rent, single-family residential units in Charlotte, North Carolina to be known as Wayford at Pringle. The project is currently under development, and the Company will disburse loan proceeds to the borrower for unit acquisitions as construction is completed. The Pringle Loan is comprised of two notes as follows: Note A in the maximum principal amount up to million and Note B in the maximum principal amount up to million. Note B has certain conversion options that require the consent of both parties before such options can be exercised; neither party has unilateral control to enforce a conversion. The Company has evaluated both notes and concluded that loan accounting treatment is appropriate for Note A, whereas Note B, due to the conversion options, meets the criteria of a debt security and is considered as available for sale. The Company records both notes in notes and accrued interest receivable, net in its consolidated balance sheets, and the interest income earned on both notes is recorded in interest income from loan investments in its consolidated statements of operations. Note A and Note B both have an initial maturity of January 12, 2026 and contain (4) extension options subject to certain conditions. Note A bears interest on the amount drawn at the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus through initial maturity, and if extended, such rate becomes subject to a rate floor. Note A has regular monthly payments that are interest-only during the term of the loan, and no prepayment of Note A, in part or in whole, can be made prior to prepayment of Note B subject to certain conditions. On Note B, interest shall accrue on the amount drawn at a rate of per annum, compounded monthly, with outstanding principal and accrued interest amounts due upon maturity. Note B can be prepaid in part or in whole subject to minimum interest. As of September 30, 2024, construction was completed on of the total units, and the Company had funded million of Note A and fully funded the million of Note B. There were no unrealized gains or losses associated with Note B as of September 30, 2024 as the Company determined that the million face value of Note B represents its fair value at such measurement date. The Woods at Forest Hill Loan Financing In December 2023, the Company assumed an million senior loan (the Woods Loan made to an unaffiliated third-party borrower for build-to-rent, single family residential units in Forest Hill, Texas. The Woods Loan investment was in addition to the Company s existing preferred equity investment in The Woods at Forest Hill. The Woods Loan borrower is currently in the process of selling the individual units, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the borrower sold of the units that collateralized the Company s loan and preferred equity investments in The Woods at Forest Hill. Proceeds from the sales of these units were used to fully pay off the Woods Loan investment made by the Company in the aggregate amount of million, which included principal investment of million and accrued interest of million, with the final payment received in August 2024. Following the payoff of the Woods Loan, remaining available proceeds from the unit sales were used to partially redeem the Company s preferred equity investment in The Woods at Forest Hill (refer to Note 7 for further information).

(2) Real estate assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are presented separately within operating real estate held for sale, net on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair value is based on discussions with third party brokers, historical sales experience, and current market conditions. 
 Derivative Financial Instruments The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are valued using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and volatility. The fair value of interest rate caps is determined using the market-standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts which would occur if floating interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The floating interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The inputs used in the valuation of interest rate caps and swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Overview We own and operate high-quality single-family properties located in attractive markets with a focus on the knowledge-economy and high-quality of life growth markets of the Sunbelt and Western United States. Our principal objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on investments where we believe we can drive growth in funds from operations and net asset value by acquiring pre-existing single-family residential units, developing build-to-rent communities, and through Value-Add renovations. Our Value-Add strategy focuses on repositioning lower-quality, less current assets to drive rent growth and expand margins to increase net operating income and maximize our return on investment. As of September 30, 2024, we held twenty real estate investments, consisting of twelve consolidated investments and eight preferred equity and loan investments. The twenty investments represent an aggregate of 4,000 residential units, comprised of 2,742 consolidated units, of which 170 units are under development, and 1,258 units through preferred equity and loan investments, which includes planned units and those under development. As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated operating investments were approximately 90.5 occupied; excluding units classified as held for sale and down/renovation units, our consolidated operating investments were approximately 94.3 occupied.

 We have elected to be treated, and currently qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain our REIT status, we are required, among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and we would not be permitted to qualify as a REIT for four years following the year in which we lost our qualification. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and results of operations. We intend to continue to organize and operate in such a manner as to remain qualified as a REIT. Inflation and Related Economic Volatility While inflationary pressures have shown signs of moderation, including a 50-basis point reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve in September 2024, we continue to monitor inflation and interest rates and resulting economic changes in credit and capital markets. Inflation and its related impacts, including increased prices for services and goods and higher interest rates and wages, and any policy interventions by the U.S. government, could negatively impact our residents ability to pay rents and our results of operations. Substantially all our leases are for a term of one year or less, which we believe mitigates our exposure to inflation, by permitting us to set rents commensurate with inflation (subject to rent regulations to the extent they apply and assuming our current or prospective residents will accept and can pay commensurate increased rents, of which there can be no assurance). Inflation could outpace any increases in rent and adversely affect us. We may not be able to mitigate the effects of inflation and related impacts, and the duration and extent of any prolonged periods of inflation, and any such related adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition are unknown at this time. Inflation may also cause increased volatility in financial markets, which could affect our ability to access the capital markets or impact the cost or timing at which we are able to do so. Inflation may also increase the costs to complete our development projects, including costs of materials, labor and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Higher construction costs could adversely impact our investments in real estate assets and our expected yields on development projects. Additionally, developments in the banking industry in early 2023 caused uncertainty and concern regarding the strength of the banking system. As a result, the cost of obtaining debt from credit and capital markets increased as many lenders increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, and reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Although our banking relationships are primarily with large national banks, a significant disruption to the banking system could lead to market-wide liquidity problems which could adversely affect our access to capital and our cost of capital. If we need to incur debt from a source other than our revolving credit facilities, we cannot be certain the additional financing will be available to the extent required and on acceptable terms. If debt financing on acceptable terms is not available, we may be unable to fully execute our growth strategy, otherwise take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Other weakened economic conditions, including job losses, high unemployment levels, stock market volatility, and uncertainty about the future, could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels. Unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results. Other Significant Developments Investment Activity Summary Provided below is a summary of our investment activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: Acquisition of Villas at Huffmeister On March 25, 2024, we, through a 95 owned joint venture entity, acquired a 294-unit single-family residential community located in Houston, Texas known as Villas at Huffmeister.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue Rental and other property revenues increased 1.8 million, or 18 , to 12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 10.2 million for the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to: (i) the acquisition of 294 units at Villas at Huffmeister during the first quarter 2024 and 200 units at Avenue at Timberlin Park during the third quarter 2024, and (ii) rental rate improvements from our active management and organic market rent growth. The increase was partially offset by the sale of 176 units at Navigator Villas and 95 single family units in our portfolio since July 1, 2023. Our average rent per occupied unit increased 54, or 3.4 , to 1,635 as compared to 1,581 during the prior year period. Average occupancy decreased 20 basis points from 91.1 to 90.9 on a year over year basis. Interest income from loan investments amounted to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to zero for the same prior year period due to three new loan investments since the fourth quarter 2023. We did not have any loan investments during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Expenses Property operating expenses increased 1.3 million, or 25 , to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.1 million for the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to: (i) the acquisition of 294 units at Villas at Huffmeister during the first quarter 2024 and 200 units at Avenue at Timberlin Park during the third quarter 2024, and (ii) an increase in turnover expenses subsequent to initial renovation completed in previous years. The increase was partially offset by the sale of 176 units at Navigator Villas and 95 single-family units since July 1, 2023. Property operating expenses consist of controllable (payroll, repairs and maintenance, turnover, administrative, advertising, and utilities) and non-controllable (real estate taxes and insurance) expenses. Controllable expenses were 3.5 million and 2.6 million, and non-controllable expenses were 2.9 million and 2.5 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Property management and asset management fee expenses were 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.1 million for the same prior year period. Property management fees are based on a stated percentage of property revenues and asset management fees are based on a stated percentage of capital contributions or assets under management, where applicable. General and administrative expenses amounted to 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.7 million for the same prior year period. Of the 2.5 million total expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 1.5 million related to direct costs incurred by us, while the remaining 1.0 million related to the operating expense reimbursement to our Manager, which includes rent, utilities, and IT expenses. The expense reimbursement to our Manager also included a 0.7 million reimbursement for accounting and legal services. Prior to the fourth quarter 2023, the Manager elected to not seek reimbursement for legal and accounting services during our first year of operations. For the third quarter 2024, we will pay the full operating expense reimbursement of 1.0 million to the Manager in cash; for the same prior year period, we paid the full operating expense reimbursement of 0.4 million to the Manager through the issuance of C-LTIP Units. Management fees to related party amounted to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.0 million for the same prior year period. The increase was due to an increase in equity primarily from our continuous registered offering of Series A Preferred Stock, which began in the third quarter of 2023. For the third quarter 2024, we will pay the base management fee of 2.4 million to the Manager as one half (50 in C-LTIP Units and the remainder in cash; for the same prior year period, we paid the full base management fee of 2.0 million to the Manager through the issuance of C-LTIP Units. Weather-related losses amounted to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to zero for the same prior year period. The 2024 expense primarily relates to hurricane damage in Texas. Depreciation and amortization expenses were 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.1 million for the same prior year period, with the increase primarily attributable to the acquisition of Villas at Huffmeister during the first quarter 2024. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense amounted to income of 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to income of 0.2 million for the same prior year period. This was due to a 10.3 million increase in gain on sales of real estate investments and a 0.6 million increase in interest income from our short-term cash investments. These income sources were partially offset by a 1.7 million net increase in interest expense primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of the interest rate caps and swaps and an increase in the outstanding debt to 231.8 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to 167.1 million at September 30, 2023 and a 1.0 million impairment on real estate.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue Rental and other property revenues increased 4.1 million, or 13 , to 34.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 30.6 million for the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to: (i) the acquisition of 294 units at Villas at Huffmeister during the first quarter 2024 and 200 units at Avenue at Timberlin Park during the third quarter 2024, and (ii) rental rate improvements from our active management and organic market rent growth. The increase was partially offset by the sale of 176 units of Navigator Villas and 104 single-family units in our portfolio since January 1, 2023. Our average rent per occupied unit increased 57, or 3.7 , to 1,617 as compared to 1,560 during the prior year period. Average occupancy remained consistent at 91.9 on a year over year basis. Interest income from loan investments amounted to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to zero for the same prior year period due to three new loan investments since the fourth quarter 2023. We did not have any loan investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses Property operating expenses increased 3.2 million, or 23 , to 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14.2 million for the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to: (i) the acquisition of 294 units at Villas at Huffmeister during the first quarter 2024 and 200 units at Avenue at Timberlin Park during the third quarter 2024, and (ii) an increase in turnover expenses subsequent to initial renovation completed in previous years. The increase was partially offset by the sale of 176 units at Navigator Villas and 104 single-family units since January 1, 2023. Property operating expenses consist of controllable (payroll, repairs and maintenance, turnover, administrative, advertising, and utilities) and non-controllable (real estate taxes and insurance) expenses. Controllable expenses were 9.2 million and 6.8 million, and non-controllable expenses were 8.2 million and 7.4 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Property management and asset management fee expenses were 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.3 million for the same prior year period. Property management fees are based on a stated percentage of property revenues and asset management fees are based on a stated percentage of capital contributions or assets under management, where applicable. General and administrative expenses amounted to 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.5 million for the same prior year period. Of the 7.8 million total expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 4.5 million related to direct costs incurred by us, while the remaining 3.3 million related to the operating expense reimbursement to our Manager, which includes rent, utilities, and IT expenses. The expense reimbursement to our Manager also included a 2.2 million reimbursement for accounting and legal services. Prior to the fourth quarter 2023, the Manager elected to not seek reimbursement for legal and accounting services during our first year of operations. Commencing with the operating expense reimbursement for the first quarter 2024, we paid, and expect to continue to pay, the operating expense reimbursement to the Manager entirely in cash; prior to the first quarter 2024, we paid the full operating expense reimbursement to the Manager through the issuance of C-LTIP Units. Management fees to related party amounted to 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.9 million for the same prior year period. The increase was due to an increase in equity primarily from our continuous registered offering of Series A Preferred Stock, which began in the third quarter of 2023. Commencing with the base management fee for the first quarter 2024, we paid, and expect to continue to pay, the base management fee to the Manager as one half (50 in C-LTIP Units and the remainder in cash; prior to the first quarter 2024, we paid the full base management fee to the Manager through the issuance of C-LTIP Units. Acquisition and other transaction costs amounted to zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.8 million for the same prior year period. Acquisition costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future periods. The 2023 expense primarily relates to the transition of property management services for over 1,000 homes. Weather-related losses amounted to 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to zero for the same prior year period. The 2024 expense primarily relates to hurricane damage in Texas.

 Depreciation and amortization expenses were 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.1 million for the same prior year period, with the increase primarily attributable to the acquisition of Villas at Huffmeister during the first quarter 2024. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense amounted to income of 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to income of 2.1 million for the same prior year period. This was due to a 10.3 million increase in gain on sales of real estate investments and a 2.2 million increase in interest income from our short-term cash investments. These income sources were partially offset by a 4.1 million net increase in interest expense primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of the interest rate caps and swaps and an increase in the outstanding debt to 231.8 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to 153.2 million at December 31, 2022, a 2.2 million impairment on real estate, and a 0.3 million increase in provision for credit losses. Net Operating Income We believe that net operating income NOI is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and interest. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. NOI also is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company s operating performance. We believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from operating income or net income prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). NOI allows us to evaluate the operating performance of our properties because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance and captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses.

 However, NOI should only be used as a supplemental measure of our financial performance. The following table reflects net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders together with a reconciliation to NOI, as computed in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):

Our primary short-term liquidity requirements historically have related to (i) our operating expenses and other general business needs, (ii) investment in real estate, (iii) distributions to stockholders, (iv) committed investments and capital requirements to fund development and renovations at existing properties, (v) ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, including our revolving credit facilities and our maturing debt, and (vi) Class A common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase plan. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our short-term liquidity needs could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024. While consolidated occupancy excluding units classified as held for sale and down/renovation units remains strong at 94.3 as of September 30, 2024, in future periods we may experience reduced levels of tenant retention, and reduced foot traffic and lease applications from prospective tenants. In general, we believe our available cash balances, cash flows from operations, proceeds from the offering of our Series A Preferred Stock, proceeds from our revolving credit facilities, proceeds from future mortgage debt financings for acquisitions and/or development projects, and other financing arrangements will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements with respect to our existing portfolio for the next 12 months. In general, we expect that our results related to our existing portfolio will improve in future periods as a result of anticipated future investments in and acquisitions of single-family residential properties and build-to-rent development properties.

 We believe we will be able to meet our primary liquidity requirements going forward through, among other sources: 155.1 million in cash available at September 30, 2024; capacity of 65 million, of which approximately 13 million was available at September 30, 2024, on our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from future mortgage debt financings for acquisitions and/or development projects; cash generated from operating activities; and proceeds from the offering of our Series A Preferred Stock and potential offerings of common and preferred stock, as well as issuances of units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership OP Units ). 
 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 related to our mortgage notes secured by our properties and revolving credit facilities. At September 30, 2024, our estimated future required payments on these obligations were as follows (amounts in thousands): 

Total 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 Thereafter Mortgages Payable (Principal) 126,849 413 39,177 6,809 80,450 Revolving Credit Facilities 105,000 20,000 85,000 Estimated Interest Payments on Mortgages Payable and Revolving Credit Facilities 29,808 3,513 13,741 9,934 2,620 Total 261,657 23,926 137,918 16,743 83,070 Estimated interest payments are based on the stated rates for mortgage notes payable assuming the interest rate in effect for the most recent quarter remains in effect through the respective maturity dates. As of September 30, 2024, we have contractual commitments to fund future cash obligations in certain of our loan and preferred equity investments in the aggregate of 7.8 million. In addition, we have made a commitment to fund the total estimated project costs of 56.9 million for the development of Abode Wendell Falls, a 170-unit build-to-rent development project in Wendell, North Carolina. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining estimated project costs to complete Abode Wendell Falls is 50.0 million. As equity capital market conditions permit, we may supplement our capital for short-term liquidity needs with proceeds of potential offerings of our common and preferred stock, as well as the issuance of OP Units. Given the significant volatility in the trading price of REIT equities and our otherwise stable financial condition and liquidity position, we cannot provide assurances that these offerings are a likely source of capital to meet short-term liquidity needs. On February 13, 2024, our board of directors (the Board authorized a stock repurchase plan for the repurchase, from time to time, of up to an aggregate of 5 million of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock, with such repurchases to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act and subject to Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The repurchase plan has a term of one year and may be discontinued at any time. The extent to which we repurchase shares of our Class A common stock under the repurchase plan, and the timing of any such repurchases, depends on a variety of factors including general business and market conditions and other corporate considerations. We expect to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock through open market transactions subject to market conditions, certain price limitations and other conditions established under the plan. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in conformity with the method, timing, price and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. As of September 30, 2024, we had not made any repurchases of our Class A common stock. Our primary long-term liquidity requirements relate to (i) costs for additional single-family residential investments, including build-to-rent development projects, (ii) repayment of long-term debt and our revolving credit facilities, (iii) capital expenditures, (iv) cash redemption requirements related to our Series A Preferred Stock, and (v) Class A common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase plan. We intend to finance our long-term liquidity requirements with net proceeds of additional issuances of common and preferred stock, including issuances in connection with the continuous registered offering of our Series A Preferred Stock, our revolving credit facilities, as well as future acquisition or project-based borrowings. Our success in meeting these requirements will therefore depend upon our ability to access capital. Further, our ability to access equity capital is dependent upon, among other things, general market conditions for REITs and the capital markets in general, market perceptions about us and our asset class, and current trading prices of our securities.

 As we did in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we may also selectively sell consolidated operating assets at appropriate times, which would be expected to generate cash sources for both our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We may also meet our long-term liquidity needs through borrowings from a number of sources, either at the corporate or project level. We believe our revolving credit facilities will serve as our primary debt source that will continue to enable us to deploy our capital more efficiently and provide capital structure flexibility as we grow our asset base. In addition to restrictive covenants, our revolving credit facilities contain material financial covenants. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities. We will continue to monitor the debt markets, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and as market conditions permit, access borrowings that are advantageous to us. If we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, we would likely need to curtail our investment activities, including acquisitions and improvements to and developments of real properties, which could limit our growth prospects. This, in turn, could reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more securities or borrowing more money. We also may be forced to dispose of assets at inopportune times to maintain REIT qualification and Investment Company Act exemption. We expect to maintain a distribution on our Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms which require monthly dividends. While our distributions through September 30, 2024 have been paid from cash flow from operations and in accordance with our policy, distributions in the future may be paid from cash flow from operations, proceeds from the offering of our Series A Preferred Stock, the sales of assets, and additional sources, such as from borrowings. We have notes receivable in conjunction with properties that are in lease-up. To date, these investments have been structured as senior loans, and in the future, we may also provide mezzanine financing to these types of projects. The notes receivable provide a current stated return and require repayment based on a fixed maturity date. If the property does not repay the notes receivable upon maturity, our income, FFO, CFFO and cash flows could be reduced below the stated returns currently being recognized if the property does not produce sufficient cash flow to pay its operating expenses and debt service, or to refinance its debt obligations. We also have preferred equity interests in properties that are in various stages of development and in lease-up, and our preferred equity investments are structured to provide a current and/or accrued preferred return during all phases. Each joint venture in which we own a preferred equity interest is required to redeem our preferred equity interests, plus any accrued preferred return, based on a fixed maturity date, generally in relation to the property s construction loan or mortgage loan maturity. Upon redemption of the preferred equity interests, our income, FFO, CFFO and cash flows could be reduced below the preferred returns currently being recognized. Alternatively, if the joint ventures do not redeem our preferred equity interest when required, our income, FFO, CFFO and cash flows could be reduced if the development project does not produce sufficient cash flow to pays its operating expenses, debt service and preferred return obligations. As we evaluate our capital position and capital allocation strategy, we may consider alternative means of financing our development loan and preferred equity investment activities at the subsidiary level. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we have off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures. At September 30, 2024, we own interests in six joint ventures that are accounted for as held to maturity debt securities. Cash Flows from Operating Activities As of September 30, 2024, we held twenty real estate investments, consisting of twelve consolidated investments and eight preferred equity and loan investments, with the twenty investments representing an aggregate of 4,000 residential units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 4.1 million after net loss of 4.8 million was adjusted for the following: non-cash items of 9.4 million; an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of 3.2 million; distributions of income and income from preferred equity investments of 2.1 million; and an increase in due to affiliates, net of 0.1 million; offset by: an increase in accounts receivable, prepaids and other assets of 5.2 million; and an increase in notes and accrued interest receivable of 0.7 million.

 Cash Flows from Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 22.4 million, primarily due to the following: 51.5 million used in acquiring consolidated real estate investments; 24.6 million used in investments in notes receivable; 5.9 million used on capital expenditures; 3.0 million used in investments in preferred equity investments; and 2.7 million paid for an interest rate cap; offset by: 44.0 million of proceeds from sales of real estate investments; 12.8 million of proceeds from the redemption of preferred equity investments; 8.3 million of repayments of notes receivable; and 0.1 million of insurance proceeds related to real estate investments. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 96.8 million, due to the following: net proceeds of 76.7 million from the issuance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; 35.0 million of proceeds from revolving credit facilities; 23.7 million of borrowings on mortgages payable; and 1.0 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests; offset by: 21.3 million of repayments on our mortgages payable including prepayment penalties; 8.5 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests; 3.9 million of distributions to common stockholders; 2.6 million used in the purchase of interests from noncontrolling interests; 1.7 million of distributions to preferred stockholders; 1.5 million of payments of deferred financing fees; and 0.1 million of distributions paid to partially owned properties noncontrolling interests. 
 Capital Expenditures The following table summarizes our total capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Redevelopment/renovations 2,568 3,917 Routine capital expenditures 2,939 2,268 Normally recurring capital expenditures 470 314 Total capital expenditures 5,977 6,499 Redevelopment and renovation costs are non-recurring capital expenditures for significant projects, such as preparing a unit for rental. The renovation work varies, but may include flooring, cabinetry, paint, plumbing, appliances and other items required to make the unit rent ready. Routine capital expenditures are necessary non-revenue generating improvements that extend the useful life of the property and that are less frequent in nature, such as roof repairs and concrete work/asphalt resurfacing. Normally recurring capital expenditures are necessary non-revenue generating improvements that occur on a regular ongoing basis, such as flooring and appliances.

 Funds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unit Holders We believe that funds from operations FFO ), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), and core funds from operations CFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. We define FFO, consistent with the NAREIT definition, as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable real estate property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for notes receivable, preferred equity investments and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. CFFO makes certain adjustments to FFO, removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations such as acquisition and other transaction costs, non-cash interest, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, provision for (recovery of) credit losses, losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs (includes prepayment penalties incurred and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and fair market value adjustments of assumed debt), one-time weather-related costs, equity compensation expense, and preferred stock accretion. We believe that CFFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility, but which do not directly relate to our core recurring property operations. As a result, we believe that CFFO can help facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and provides a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential. Our calculation of CFFO differs from the methodology used for calculating CFFO by certain other REITs and, accordingly, our CFFO may not be comparable to CFFO reported by other REITs. Our management utilizes FFO and CFFO as measures of our operating performance after adjustment for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, and acquisition and other transaction costs that are required by GAAP to be expensed but may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and that may not accurately compare our operating performance between periods. Furthermore, although FFO and CFFO and other supplemental performance measures are defined in various ways throughout the REIT industry, we also believe that FFO and CFFO may provide us and our stockholders with an additional useful measure to compare our financial performance to certain other REITs. Neither FFO nor CFFO is equivalent to net income (loss), including net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, FFO and CFFO do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Neither FFO nor CFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income, including net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

Presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the sustainability of the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO or CFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO or CFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders or as an indication of our liquidity, nor is either indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Both FFO and CFFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.

 (1) Holders of record of newly issued Series A Preferred Stock shares that are held only a portion of the applicable monthly dividend period will receive a prorated dividend based on the actual number of days in the applicable dividend period during which each such share of Series A Preferred Stock was outstanding. (2) Holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock shares as of the close of business on each day of the applicable month were entitled to additional contingent special daily dividends for each such day, to be aggregated and payable (if at all) on the payable date, in each case equal to the amount (if any) by which (i) the Stated Value of the Series A Preferred Stock multiplied by (a) the sum of (I) the average 10-year Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rate for the period from the 26 th of the prior month to the 25 th of the applicable month (as reported by the United States Department of the Treasury), plus (II) two percent, divided by (b) twelve, divided further by (c) the actual number of days in the applicable month, exceeds (ii) the quotient of (a) 0.125 divided by (b) the actual number of days in the applicable month. (3) Holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock shares are entitled to an enhanced special dividend, which replaces the additional contingent special daily dividends, equal to the amount by which (i) the Stated Value of the Series A Preferred Stock multiplied by (a) the sum of (I) the average of the one-month Term SOFR for each day commencing on the 26 th of the prior month to the 25 th of the applicable month, plus (II) two percent, divided by (b) twelve, exceeds (ii) the standard monthly dividend of 0.125 per share of Series A Preferred Stock. The enhanced special dividend will be aggregated with the standard monthly dividend so as to effect a dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock that is subject to a 6.5 minimum and 8.5 maximum annual rate.

 A portion of each dividend may constitute a return of capital for tax purposes. There is no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or at this rate. Holders of OP Units, LTIP Units and C-LTIP Units are entitled to receive distribution equivalents at the same time as dividends are paid to holders of our Class A common stock. Our Board will determine the amount of dividends to be paid to our stockholders. The determination of our Board will be based on several factors, including funds available from operations, our capital expenditure requirements and the annual distribution requirements necessary to maintain our REIT status for federal income tax purposes. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to maintain our REIT status for tax purposes, we must make distributions equal to at least 90 of our REIT taxable income , as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders each year. While our policy is generally to pay distributions from cash flow from operations, we may declare distributions in excess of funds from operations. Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are disclosed in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent Events Other than the items disclosed in Note 15 Subsequent Events to our interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended September 30, 2024, no material events have occurred that required recognition or disclosure in these financial statements. Refer to Note 15 of our interim Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowing activities. There is inherent roll-over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements. We are not subject to foreign exchange rates or commodity price risk, and all our financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes. Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below in thousands) presents the principal payments and the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt, by year of expected maturity, to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. Fair value adjustments and unamortized deferred financing costs, net, of approximately (4.3) million are excluded. 

2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Mortgage Notes Payable 413 1,859 37,318 1,107 5,702 80,450 126,849 Weighted Average Interest Rate 4.01 3.97 4.12 5.26 5.90 5.71 5.22 Revolving Credit Facilities 20,000 85,000 105,000 Weighted Average Interest Rate 7.97 8.00 7.99 The fair value of mortgages payable is estimated at 124.1 million at September 30, 2024. The table above incorporates those exposures that exist at September 30, 2024; it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates. At September 30, 2024, we had interest rate caps and swaps, which are not accounted for as hedges, that we primarily use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Our interest rate caps and swaps mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying interest rate for 128.5 million of our debt. Based on our debt outstanding and interest rates in effect at September 30, 2024, a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on the portion of our debt bearing interest at variable rates would increase interest expense by approximately 50,000 or decrease interest expense by approximately 50,000, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, which are controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. In connection with our existing disclosure controls and procedures, in late September 2024, we determined that a Current Report on Form 8-K was required to be filed in connection with the acquisition of a real estate operation during the first quarter of 2024. Such Form 8-K has been filed prior to the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The delinquent Form 8-K filing was an isolated incident. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e), taking into account the circumstances relating to the delinquent Form 8-K, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Notwithstanding the fact that the delinquent Form 8-K was detected in connection with our existing disclosure controls and procedures, we have nonetheless instituted additional procedures designed to ensure timely filings in the future. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors Other than the following, there have been no material changes to our potential risks and uncertainties as presented in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024. Your interests could be subordinated and/or diluted by the incurrence of additional debt, the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, including additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and by other transactions. As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness was approximately 231.8 million, which includes 105.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. We may incur significant additional debt in the future. The Series A Preferred Stock is subordinate to all our existing and future debt and liabilities and those of our subsidiaries. Our future debt may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends to preferred stockholders in the event of a default under the debt facilities or under other circumstances. In addition, our charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series, of which 30,000,000 have been classified as shares of Series A Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had issued and outstanding 3,889,446 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The issuance of additional preferred stock on parity with or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock would dilute the interests of the holders of shares of preferred stock of the applicable class or series, and any issuance of preferred stock senior to the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock, or any issuance of additional indebtedness, could affect our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on any or all of the foregoing class or series of preferred stock. We may issue preferred stock on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. Other than the right of holders to cause us to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock upon a change of control, none of the provisions relating to the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock relate to or limit our indebtedness or afford the holders of shares thereof protection in the event of a highly leveraged or other transaction, including a merger or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all our assets or business, that might adversely affect the holders of such shares. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.

Extension of Exemption from 9.8 Ownership Limitation As previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 12, 2023 by the Company, on June 28, 2023, pursuant to Section 6.1.8 of Article VI of the Company s Second Articles of Amendment and Restatement dated October 5, 2022 (the Charter ), the Board adopted resolutions decreasing each of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and the Common Share Ownership Limit (each as defined in the Charter) from 9.8 to 8.75 (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) for all stockholders of the Company that are not Excepted Holders (as defined in the Charter) (collectively, the Decreased Ownership Limits ), in connection with an exemption granted by the Board, pursuant to Section 6.1.7 of the Charter, to Par Sanda and Sand Capital Associates, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (together, the Sand Group from the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and the Common Share Ownership Limit and establishing an Excepted Holder Limit (as defined in the Charter) for the Sand Group, subject to certain limitations and conditions (collectively, the Original Exemption ). The Decreased Ownership Limits and the Original Exemption were to terminate no later than December 28, 2024 (the Revocation Date ). On November 5, 2024, pursuant to the Charter, the Board adopted resolutions to modify and extend the Original Exemption (the Modified Exemption such that the Revocation Date will be no later than December 31, 2025 (the Extended Revocation Date provided, however, that the Modified Exemption is conditioned on the same terms as the Original Exemption, with the exception of the Extended Revocation Date. We have elected to make the foregoing disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q instead of in a Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 8.01.
