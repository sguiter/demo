Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates , expects , intends , plans , believes , seeks , estimates , would , should , targets , projects and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our ability and experience operating a BDC or maintaining our tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code; 
 our dependence on key personnel; 
 our ability to maintain or develop referral relationships; 
 our ability to replicate historical results; 
 the ability of OFS Advisor to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria; 
 the belief that the carrying amounts of our financial instruments, such as cash, cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate the fair value of such items due to the short maturity of such instruments and that such financial instruments are held with high credit quality institutions to mitigate the risk of loss due to credit risk; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with OFS Advisor and other affiliates of OFSAM Holdings; 
 constraint on investment due to access to material nonpublic information; 
 restrictions on our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates; 
 the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 
 our ability to incur additional leverage pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and the impact of such leverage on our net investment income and results of operations; 
 competition for investment opportunities; 
 the belief that the seniority of our debt investments in a borrower s capital structure may provide greater downside protection against adverse economic changes, including those caused by the impacts of interest rate changes and elevated inflation rates, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the escalated armed conflict in the Middle East, instability in the U.S. and international banking systems, uncertainties related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the risk of recession or a shutdown of U.S. government services and related market volatility on our business, our portfolio companies, our industry and the global economy; 
 the percentage of investments that will bear interest on a floating rate or fixed rate basis; 
 the holding period of our investments; 
 the impact of alternative reference rates on our business, including potential additional interest rate reductions approved by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which may impact our investment income, cost of funding and the valuation of our investments; 
 our ability to raise debt or equity capital as a BDC; 
 the timing, form and amount of any distributions from our portfolio companies; 
 the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business; 
 the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 
 the impact of current political, economic and industry conditions, including changes in the interest rate environment, inflation, significant market volatility, supply chain and labor market disruptions, including those as a result of strikes, work stoppages or accidents, resource shortages and other conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, which, in turn, impacts our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 the impact of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the escalated armed conflict in the Middle East and general uncertainty surrounding the financial and political stability of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and China; 
 1 

our ability to consummate credit facilities in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; 
 the impact of information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions, and cybersecurity attacks; 
 the belief that we have sufficient levels of liquidity to support our existing portfolio companies; 
 the belief that our cash and cash equivalent balances are not exposed to any significant credit risk as a result of the previous banking failures; 
 the fluctuation of the fair value of our investments due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value; and 
 the effect of new or modified laws or regulations governing our operations. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, those described or identified in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 5, 2024. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We have based the forward-looking statements on information available to us on the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements and projections contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

 components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of and based on the average value of the Company s total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and assets owned by any consolidated entity) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, OFS Advisor agreed to reduce its base management fee attributable to all of the OFSCC-FS Assets to per quarter annualized) of the average value of the OFSCC-FS Assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. OFS Advisor s base management fee reduction is renewable on an annual basis, and OFS Advisor is not entitled to recoup the amount of the base management fee reduced with respect to the OFSCC-FS Assets. OFS Advisor most recently renewed the agreement to reduce its base management fee for the 2024 calendar year on January 8, 2024. 
 The incentive fee has parts. The first part of the incentive fee Income Incentive Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination and sourcing, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest or dividend feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest, equity investments with accruing or PIK dividend and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during such quarter. 
 The incentive fee with respect to pre-incentive fee net income is of the amount, if any, by which the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds a hurdle rate (which is annualized) and a catch-up provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, OFS Advisor receives no incentive fee until the net investment income equals the hurdle rate of , but then receives, as a catch-up, of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than . The effect of this provision is that, if pre-incentive fee net

 (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 

 in any calendar quarter, OFS Advisor will receive of the pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter in which the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. The Company s net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of the Company s gross assets used to calculate the base management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months. 
 The second part of the incentive fee (the Capital Gains Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals of the Company s aggregate realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the election to be a BDC through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses, losses on extinguishment of debt, income taxes from realized capital gains and unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less all previous amounts paid in respect of the Capital Gains Fee. Since inception through September 30, 2024, the Company has not made a Capital Gains Fee payment. 
 The Company accrues the Capital Gains Fee if, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized capital gains (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is positive. An accrued Capital Gains Fee relating to net unrealized appreciation is deferred, and not due to OFS Advisor, until the close of the year in which such gains are realized. If, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized capital gains (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) decreases during a period, the Company will reverse any excess Capital Gains Fee previously accrued such that the amount of Capital Gains Fee accrued is no more than of the sum of net realized capital gains (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no accrued Capital Gains Fees. 
 License Agreement: The Company entered into a license agreement with OFSAM under which OFSAM has granted the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name OFS. 
 Administration Agreement: OFS Services furnishes the Company with office facilities and equipment, necessary software licenses and subscriptions, and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities pursuant to the Administration Agreement.

In addition, OFS Services assists the Company in determining and publishing its net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of its tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to its stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of the Company s expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. Under the Administration Agreement, OFS Services also provides managerial assistance on the Company s behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted the Company s offer to provide such assistance. Payment under the Administration Agreement is equal to an amount based upon the Company s allocable portion of OFS Services s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including, but not limited to, rent, information technology services and the Company s allocable portion of the cost of its officers, including its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, chief accounting officer and their respective staffs.

 Non-Accrual Loans: Management reviews, for placement on non-accrual status, all loans and CLO mezzanine debt investments that become past due on principal and interest, and/or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid cash interest is reversed. Additionally, Net Loan Fees are no longer recognized as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status.

Note 5. 
 
 Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 
 Transfers between levels during the reporting periods were due to the availability of reliable Indicative Prices in those periods. The Company classifies loan investments as Level 2 when sufficient Indicative Prices are available, and the depth of the market is sufficient, in management's judgment, to transact at those prices in amounts approximating the Company s investment position at the measurement date. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market or observable inputs existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions, or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company might realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded and incur a realized capital loss. The Company s investments are subject to market risk as a result of economic and political developments, including impacts from interest rate changes and elevated inflation rates, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the escalated armed conflict in the Middle East, instability in the U.S. and international banking systems, uncertainties related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the risk of recession or a shutdown of U.S. government services and related market volatility. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which certain investments are traded and can affect the fair value of the Company s investments. The Company s investments are also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates, including potential additional interest rate reductions approved by the U.S. Federal Reserve, may impact our investment income, cost of funding and the valuation of our investment portfolio.

 (2) NAV liquidation represents the fair value, or estimated expected residual value, of the investment. 
 (3) Two valuation techniques were weighted to determinate the fair value. 
 Averages in the preceding two tables were weighted by the fair value of the related instruments. 
 Changes in market credit spreads or events impacting the credit quality of the underlying portfolio company (both of which could impact the discount rate), as well as changes in enterprise value and/or EBITDA multiples, among other things, could have a significant impact on fair values, with the fair value of a particular debt investment susceptible to change in inverse relation to the changes in the discount rate. Changes in enterprise value and/or EBITDA multiples, as well as changes in the discount rate, could have a significant impact on fair values, with the fair value of an equity investment susceptible to change in tandem with the changes in enterprise value and/or EBITDA multiples, and in inverse relation to changes in the discount rate. Due to the wide range of approaches in developing input assumptions to these valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful.

 in aggregate principal of unsecured notes. The Unsecured Notes Due February 2026 bear interest at a rate of per year payable semi-annually and mature on February 10, 2026. The Company may redeem the Unsecured Notes Due February 2026 in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at its option at par plus a make-whole premium, if applicable. 
 Unsecured Notes Due October 2028 : On October 28, 2021 and November 1, 2021, the Company issued in aggregate principal of unsecured notes.

The Company may redeem the Unsecured Notes Due October 2028 in whole or in part at any time. 
 The Unsecured Notes are direct unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all current and future unsecured indebtedness of the Company. Because the Unsecured Notes are not secured by any of the Company s assets, they are effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured unsubordinated indebtedness (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured as to which the Company subsequently grants a security interest), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including, without limitation, borrowings under the Banc of California Credit Facility. 
 The indenture governing the Unsecured Notes contains certain covenants, including: (i) prohibiting additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt securities, unless the Company's asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC, equals at least after such borrowings; and (ii) prohibiting (a) the declaration of any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of the Company s capital stock (except to the extent necessary for the Company to maintain its treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code), or (b) the purchase of any capital stock unless the Company s asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least at the time of such capital transaction and after deducting the amount of such transaction.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For additional overview information on the Company, see Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Overview 
 Key performance metrics per common share are presented below: 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Net asset value 11.29 11.51 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net investment income 0.27 0.26 0.94 1.15 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations 0.12 0.77 0.22 0.27 Distributions paid 0.34 0.34 1.02 1.00 
 Our NAV per common share decreased to 11.29 at September 30, 2024 from 11.51 at June 30, 2024, due to a net loss on investments of 0.15 per common share and our quarterly distribution of 0.34 per common share exceeding our quarterly net investment income of 0.27 per common share. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, total investment income decreased to 10.9 million from 11.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease of 0.2 million in interest income. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, interest income decreased to 10.6 million from 10.9 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a smaller average investment portfolio at cost. See Results of Operations for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt was 249.1 million and remained unchanged compared to our total outstanding debt at June 30, 2024. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our weighted-average debt interest costs remained stable at 6.46 compared to 6.45 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 50 of our outstanding debt matures in 2027 and beyond, and 72 of our outstanding debt carries fixed interest rates and is unsecured. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss on investments of 1.9 million, primarily due to net realized losses of 11.1 million, partially offset by net unrealized appreciation of 9.2 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our net realized loss of 11.1 million was primarily due to a 7.8 million loss upon the write-off of our debt and equity investments in Master Cutlery, LLC, which had no impact on our NAV during the quarter as the loss had been substantially recognized in prior fiscal periods. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our net unrealized appreciation of 9.2 million was primarily due to net unrealized appreciation of 2.8 million on our common equity in Pfanstiehl Holdings, Inc., as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized depreciation on exited investments. As of September 30, 2024, our loan portfolio had non-accrual loans with an aggregate fair value of 21.1 million, or 5.4 of our total investments at fair value. See Portfolio Composition and Investment Activity for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio of 161 exceeded the minimum asset coverage requirement of 150 under the 1940 Act, and we remained in compliance with all applicable covenants under our outstanding debt facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had unused commitments of 25.0 million under our Banc of California Credit Facility, as well as 80.9 million under our BNP Facility, each of which is subject to a borrowing base and other covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we had a payable for investments purchased of 14.7 million and unfunded commitments of 8.5 million to eight portfolio companies. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information. 
 On October 29, 2024, the Board declared a distribution of 0.34 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those relating to revenue recognition and fair value estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting policy and estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board. For descriptions of our revenue recognition and fair value policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements

 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement with OFS Advisor to manage our operating and investment activities. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay OFS Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and including assets owned by any consolidated entity) as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 3 . 
 The Administration Agreement with OFS Services, an affiliate of OFS Advisor, to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our operations. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 3 . 
 A license agreement with OFSAM, the parent company of OFS Advisor, under which OFSAM has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name OFS. Under this agreement, we have a right to use the OFS name for so long as OFS Advisor or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the OFS name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with OFS Advisor is in effect. 
 OFS Advisor s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive to us and OFS Advisor is free to furnish similar services to other entities, including other funds advised or sub-advised by OFS Advisor, so long as its services to us are not impaired. OFS Advisor also serves as the investment adviser to other funds, including HPCI and OCCI. Additionally, OFS Advisor provides sub-advisory services to various funds, including: (i) CMFT Securities Investments, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CIM Real Estate Finance Trust, Inc., a corporation that qualifies as a real estate investment trust; and (ii) CIM Real Assets Credit Fund, an externally managed registered investment company that operates as an interval fund that invests primarily in a combination of real estate, credit and related investments. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, OFS Advisor agreed to reduce its base management fee attributable to all of the OFSCC-FS Assets to 0.25 per quarter (1.00 annualized) of the average value of the OFSCC-FS Assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. OFS Advisor s base management fee reduction is renewable on an annual basis and OFS Advisor is not entitled to recoup the amount of the base management fee reduced with respect to the OFSCC-FS Assets. OFS Advisor most recently renewed the agreement to reduce its base management fee for the 2024 calendar year on January 8, 2024. 
 The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with certain affiliates absent an order from the SEC permitting the BDC to do so. On August 4, 2020, we received our existing Order, which superseded a previous order that we received on October 12, 2016, and provides us with greater flexibility to enter into co-investment transactions with certain Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies 
 51 

and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions. We are generally permitted to co-invest with Affiliated Funds if, under the terms of the Order, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that: (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned; and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. 
 In addition, we may file an application for an amendment to our existing Order to permit us to co-invest in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds even if such other funds had not previously invested in such existing portfolio companies, subject to certain conditions. However, if filed, there is no guarantee that such application will be granted. 
 Conflicts may arise when we make an investment in conjunction with an investment being made by an Affiliated Account, or in a transaction where an Affiliated Account has already made an investment. Investment opportunities are, from time to time, appropriate for more than one account in the same, different or overlapping securities of a portfolio company s capital structure. Conflicts arise in determining the terms of investments, particularly where these accounts may invest in different types of securities in a single portfolio company. Potential conflicts arise when addressing, among other things, questions as to whether payment obligations and covenants should be enforced, modified or waived, or whether debt should be restructured, modified or refinanced. For a discussion of the risks associated with conflicts of interest, see Item 1. Business Regulation Conflicts of Interest , Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to OFS Advisor and its Affiliates We have potential conflicts of interest related to the purchases and sales that OFS Advisor makes on our behalf and/or on behalf of Affiliated Accounts in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 The following table presents our ten largest investments by portfolio company based on fair value as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands): Portfolio Company Type Amortized Cost Fair Value of Total Portfolio, at Fair Value of Net Assets, at Fair Value Pfanstiehl Holdings, Inc.

As of September 30, 2024, our common equity investment in Pfanstiehl Holdings, Inc., a global manufacturer of high-purity pharmaceutical ingredients, accounted for 18.7 and 48.7 of our total portfolio at fair value and our total net assets, respectively. The value of this investment is substantially comprised of unrealized appreciation of 73.4 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 5.1 and 13.3 of our total portfolio at fair value and net assets, respectively, were comprised of Structured Finance Securities managed by a single adviser. 
 A deterioration or improvement in the operating performance of these portfolio investments, or other factors underlying the valuation of these investments, could have a material impact on our NAV. 
 Portfolio Yields 
 The following table presents weighted-average yield metrics for our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Weighted-average performing income yield (1) : 
 Debt investments 13.3 13.7 Structured Finance Securities 14.2 12.4 Interest-bearing investments 13.6 13.4 Weighted-average realized yield (2): 
 Interest-bearing investments 11.8 11.8 
 (1) Performing income yield is calculated as (a) the actual amount earned on performing interest-bearing investments, including interest, prepayment fees and amortization of Net Loan Fees, divided by (b) the weighted-average of total performing interest-bearing investments at amortized cost . 
 (2) Realized yield is calculated as a) the actual amount earned on interest-bearing investments, including interest, prepayment fees and amortization of Net Loan Fees, divided by (b) the weighted-average of total interest-bearing investments at amortized cost , in each case, including debt investments on non-accrual status and non-income producing Structured Finance Securities. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted-average performing income yield on interest-bearing investments increased to 13.6 from 13.4 during the prior quarter, primarily due to the sale of certain Structured Finance Securities and the redeployment of proceeds into higher yielding CLO subordinated note securities, partially offset by the timing of the redeployment of proceeds from repayments related to certain debt investments. 
 Weighted-average yields of our investments are not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders, but rather the gross investment income from our investment portfolio before the payment of all of our fees and expenses. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yields will remain at their current levels. As of September 30, 2024, 91 of our total loan portfolio, at fair value, consisted of variable rate investments, generally indexed to SOFR. See additional information under Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk .

 Non-Cash Investment Activity

The net realized loss of 3.5 million was fully recognized in prior fiscal periods and did not impact our NAV during the quarter. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our first lien debt investment in GoTo Group underwent a restructuring whereby our first lien debt investment was exchanged at a price equal to 77 of par for new first lien debt investments in the company. We recognized a realized loss of 0.7 million on the debt restructure corresponding to the amount forgiven upon the exchange. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we restructured our first lien debt investments in Avison Young to, among other things, exchange our first lien debt investments for new first lien debt investments, preferred equity and common equity. The cost of the existing first lien debt investments was ascribed to the new investments received in the exchange, and no realized loss was recognized. We also invested an incremental 0.8 million in new-issue first lien debt. 
 Risk Monitoring 
 We categorize debt investments into seven risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt.

 Non-Accrual Loans 
 Management reviews, for placement on non-accrual status, all loans and CLO mezzanine debt investments that become past due on principal and interest, and/or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid cash interest is reversed. Additionally, Net Loan Fees are no 
 55 

longer recognized as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Depending upon management s judgment, interest payments subsequently received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as interest income or applied as a reduction to amortized cost. Interest accruals and Net Loan Fee amortization are resumed on non-accrual investments only when they are brought current with respect to principal and interest payments and, in the judgment of management, it is probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest from the investment. 
 As of September 30, 2024 
 The following table shows the classification of our debt investments on non-accrual status (dollar amounts in thousands):

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, one first lien debt investment with an amortized cost and fair value of 4.5 million and 2.4 million, respectively, was placed on non-accrual status. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we wrote off our subordinated debt investment in Master Cutlery, LLC, which was previously on non-accrual status, following a partial-recovery payment of 0.3 million, resulting in a net realized loss of 4.4 million. The net realized loss was fully recognized in prior periods as an unrealized loss.

Results of Operations 
 Our key financial measures are described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Key Financial Measures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 5, 2024. The following is a discussion of the key financial measures that management employs in reviewing the performance of our operations. 
 We do not believe that our historical operating performance is necessarily indicative of our future results of operations. We are primarily focused on debt investments in middle-market and larger companies in the United States and, to a lesser extent, equity investments, including warrants and other minority equity securities, and Structured Finance Securities. This approach differs from our historical investment concentration in that we now also focus on the debt of larger U.S. companies and Structured Finance Securities. Moreover, as a BDC and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints on our operations, including, but not limited to, limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. For the reasons described above, the results of operations described below may not necessarily be indicative of the results we expect to report in future periods. 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, annual comparisons of net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful. 
 The following analysis compares our quarterly results of operations to the preceding quarter, as well as our year-to-date results of operations to the corresponding period in the prior year. We believe a comparison of our current quarterly results to the preceding quarter is more meaningful and transparent than a comparison to the corresponding prior-year quarter as our results of operations are not influenced by seasonal factors the latter comparison is designed to elicit and highlight.

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Consolidated operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Investment income Interest income: Cash interest income 7,535 7,931 23,683 31,171 PIK interest income 349 492 1,183 610 Net Loan Fee amortization

 Investment Income 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income decreased to 10.9 million from 11.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease in interest income of 0.2 million. 
 Interest income decreased 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to an aggregate decrease of 0.5 million in contractual cash and PIK interest, partially offset by an increase in accretion of interest income on our CLO subordinated notes of 0.4 million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, dividend and fee income remained stable compared to the prior quarter. 
 Fee income is primarily comprised of unused fees, prepayment fees and syndication fees that generally result from periodic transactions rather than from holding portfolio investments, and are considered non-recurring. We receive syndication fees on investments where OFS Advisor sources, structures, and arranges the lending group. 
 57 

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 7.1 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in total interest income of 8.9 million, partially offset by an increase in total dividend income of 1.8 million. 
 Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Interest expense 4,022 4,117 12,711 14,798 Base management fee 1,472 1,478 4,473 5,573 Income Incentive Fee 901 859 3,159 3,866 Professional fees 391 414 1,219 1,262 Administration fee 337 453 1,184 1,302 Other expenses 192 407 934 1,196 Total expenses 7,315 7,728 23,680 27,997 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.1 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease of 6.1 million in our average outstanding debt balances compared to the prior quarter. 
 Other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.2 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to an excise tax refund accrual of 0.1 million upon finalizing the prior year tax return, as well as the prior quarter including the write-off of 0.1 million of deferred offering costs upon our new shelf registration statement being deemed effective. 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.1 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to the full repayment of our SBA debentures in March 2024 and a reduction in the outstanding amount under the BNP Facility. 
 Base management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.1 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in our average total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) during the period. 
 Income Incentive Fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.7 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in our average interest-bearing investment portfolio, at cost, which reduced our net investment income during the current year. 
 Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments 
 Net gain (loss) on investments, inclusive of realized and unrealized gains (losses), by investment type for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Debt investments (4,327) (3,079) (8,656) (3,080) Equity investments 3,916 8,310 (1,421) (5,052) Structured Finance Securities (1,272) 1,798 841 (3,421) Current/deferred income tax expense (232) (138) (433) (54) Total net gain (loss) on investments (1,915) 6,891 (9,669) (11,607)

Net gain (loss) on investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss on investments of 1.9 million, primarily comprised of aggregate net losses of 5.6 million on our loans and Structured Finance Securities, and partially offset by net gains of 3.7 million on our equity securities. 
 Three months ended June 30, 2024 
 For the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized a net gain on investments of 6.9 million, primarily due to net unrealized appreciation of 11.2 million, net of taxes, partially offset by net realized losses of 4.3 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, our net unrealized appreciation of 11.2 million, net of taxes, was primarily related to net unrealized appreciation of 7.8 million on our common equity in Pfanstiehl Holdings, Inc., and net unrealized appreciation of 2.1 million on our subordinated note investment in Apex Credit CLO 2020 Ltd. 
 Net gain (loss) on investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss on investments of 9.7 million, primarily due to a net loss on our debt investments of 8.7 million, of which 6.4 million related to net unrealized depreciation on our current non-accrual debt investments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our common equity investment in Pfanstiehl Holdings, Inc. experienced net unrealized appreciation of 2.7 million. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our portfolio experienced net losses of 11.6 million, primarily due to net unrealized depreciation of 6.7 million on our common equity, warrants and other investments and 3.4 million on our Structured Finance Securities, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our common equity investment in Pfanstiehl Holdings, Inc. experienced unrealized depreciation of 8.4 million. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we redeemed SBA debentures of 19.0 million, and, as a result, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.2 million related to the acceleration of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs on the redeemed debentures. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents of 20.3 million, which included 8.0 million held by OFSCC-FS. Distributions from OFSCC-FS to the Parent are restricted by the terms and conditions of the BNP Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Parent received 8.8 million in cash distributions from OFSCC-FS. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an unused commitment of 25.0 million under our Banc of California Credit Facility, as well as an unused commitment of 80.9 million under our BNP Facility, both of which are subject to a borrowing base requirements and other covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we had a payable for investments purchased of 14.7 million and unfunded commitments of 8.5 million to eight portfolio companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount outstanding of the senior securities issued by us was 249.1 million, for which our asset coverage was 161 , exceeding our minimum asset coverage requirement of 150 under the 1940 Act. The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness. 
 59 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 We generate operating cash flows from net investment income and the net proceeds from liquidation of portfolio investments, and use cash in our operations in the net purchase of portfolio investments and payment of expenses. Significant variations may exist between net investment income and cash from net investment income, primarily due to the recognition of non-cash investment income, including certain Net Loan Fee amortization, PIK interest and PIK dividends, which generally will not be fully realized in cash until we exit the investment, as well as accreted interest income on Structured Finance Securities, which may not coincide with cash distributions from these investments. As discussed in Item 1. Financial Statements Note 3, we pay OFS Advisor a quarterly incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income, which may include investment income that we have not received in cash. In addition, we must distribute substantially all of our taxable income, which approximates, but will not always equal, the cash we generate from net investment income to maintain our RIC tax treatment. We also obtain cash to fund investments or general corporate activities from the issuance of securities and our revolving lines of credit. These principal sources and uses of cash and liquidity are presented below (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash from net investment income (1) 
 8,815 12,638 Net (purchases and originations) / repayments and sales of portfolio investments (1) 
 33,100 34,365 Net cash provided by operating activities 41,915 47,003 Distributions paid to stockholders (2) 
 (13,666) (13,398) Net repayments under revolving lines of credit (21,400) (13,600) Repayments of SBA debentures (31,920) (19,000) Net cash used in financing activities (66,986) (45,998) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (25,071) 1,005 
 (1) Cash from net investment income includes all other cash flows from operating activities reported in our statements of cash flows. Net purchases and originations/repayments and sales of portfolio investments includes the purchase and origination of portfolio investments, proceeds from principal payments on portfolio investments, proceeds from sale or redemption of portfolio investments, changes in receivable for investments sold, payable from investments purchased as reported in our statements of cash flows, as well as differences in proceeds from distributions received from Structured Finance Securities relative to accretion of interest income on Structured Finance Securities. 
 (2) The determination of the tax attributes of our distributions is made annually as of the end of our fiscal year based upon our ICTI for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of our distributions for a full year. 
 Cash from net investment income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash from net investment income of 8.8 million decreased 3.8 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 5.7 million in cash interest and dividend income. 
 Net (purchases and originations) / repayments and sales of portfolio investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales and repayments of portfolio investments of 33.1 million were primarily due to 79.2 million of cash we received from principal repayments, sales on our portfolio investments and the proceeds from distributions received from Structured Finance Securities, net of accretion of interest income on Structured Finance Securities, partially offset by 46.1 million of cash we used to purchase portfolio investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net sales and repayments of portfolio investments of 34.4 million were primarily due to 69.1 million of cash we received from amortized cost repayments, sales on our portfolio investments, net proceeds from distributions received from Structured Finance Securities and accretion of interest income on Structured Finance Securities, partially offset by 34.7 million of cash we used to purchase portfolio investments.

- and million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had - - outstanding and an unused commitment of 25.0 million under the Banc of California Credit Facility, subject to a borrowing base and other covenants. The Banc of California Credit Facility bears interest at a variable Prime Rate plus a 0.25 margin, with a 5.00 floor, and as of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on the Banc of California Credit Facility was 8.75 . 
 million in outstanding Unsecured Notes. The Unsecured Notes are direct unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our current and future unsecured indebtedness. Because the Unsecured Notes are not secured by any of our assets, they are effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured unsubordinated indebtedness (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured as to which we subsequently grant a security interest), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including, without limitation, borrowings under the Banc of California Credit Facility and BNP Facility. 
 In order to, among other things, reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase the Unsecured Notes for cash in open market purchases and/or privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account our current liquidity, prospects for future access to capital, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no outstanding Unsecured Notes were repurchased. 
 million was drawn as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the BNP Facility bear interest based on SOFR for the relevant interest period, plus an applicable spread (subject to an effective floor of 2.65 ). The reinvestment period (and the ability to access the undrawn facility commitment) of the BNP Facility ends on June 20, 2025, unless extended. Borrowings under the BNP Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets held by OFSCC-FS. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance in all material respects with the applicable covenants under the BNP Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on the BNP Facility was 8.78 and the unused commitment under the facility was 80.9 million. 
 On a stand-alone basis, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, OFSCC-FS held approximately 154.5 million and 158.3 million in total assets, respectively, which accounted for approximately 37 and 34 of our total consolidated assets, respectively. 
 
 Other Liquidity Matters 
 We expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio utilizing our current borrowings, follow-on equity offerings, and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We cannot assure stockholders 
 61 

that our plans to raise capital will be successful or available to us on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments or make additional investments in our portfolio companies. The illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value and incur a capital loss. 
 As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our assets, as defined by the 1940 Act, are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than 250 million, in each case organized in the United States. Conversely, we may invest up to 30 of our portfolio in opportunistic investments not otherwise eligible under BDC regulations. Specifically, as part of this 30 basket, we may consider investments in investment funds that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions to the 1940 Act and in advisers to similar investment funds, as well as in debt or equity of middle-market portfolio companies located outside of the United States and debt and equity of public companies that do not meet the definition of eligible portfolio companies because their market capitalization of publicly traded equity securities exceeds the levels provided for in the 1940 Act. We have, and may continue to, make opportunistic investments in Structured Finance Securities and other non-qualifying assets, consistent with our investment strategy. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 81 of our investments were qualifying assets. 
 On May 3, 2018, our Board, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, effective May 3, 2019, our minimum required asset coverage ratio decreased from 200 to 150 . 
 On May 22, 2018, the Board authorized the Stock Repurchase Program under which we could acquire up to 10.0 million of our outstanding common stock through the two-year period ended May 22, 2020. On each of May 4, 2020 and May 3, 2022, our Board extended the Stock Repurchase Program for additional two-year periods. On April 30, 2024, our Board extended the Stock Repurchase Program for the two-year period ending on May 22, 2026. Under the extended Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase shares in open-market transactions, including through block purchases, depending on prevailing market conditions and other factors. We expect the Stock Repurchase Program to be in place through May 22, 2026, or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. The Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares, and all repurchases will be made in accordance with SEC Rule 10b-18, which sets certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of stock repurchases. The Stock Repurchase Program may be extended, modified or discontinued at any time for any reason. We have provided our stockholders with notice of our intention to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with 1940 Act requirements. We retire all shares of common stock that we purchased in connection with the Stock Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not make any repurchases of common stock on the open market under the Stock Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, the approximate dollar value of shares remaining that may be purchased under the program was 9.6 million. 
 As a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if the Board determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approve such sale. On June 26, 2024, our stockholders approved a proposal to authorize us, with approval of our Board, to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock (during a twelve-month period) at a price below our then-current net asset value per share in one or more offerings, subject to certain limitations (including that the cumulative number of shares sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed 25 of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale). We have not sold any shares below net asset value pursuant to the proposal approved by our stockholders. 
 We continue to monitor the current banking environment. If the banks and financial institutions with whom we have credit facilities enter into receivership, undergo consolidation or become insolvent in the future, our liquidity may be reduced significantly. At various times, our cash balances at third-party financial institutions exceed the federally insured limit. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are retained in custodian accounts with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association and Citibank N.A., and we do not believe they are exposed to any significant credit risk.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 20.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well unused commitments of 25.0 million under our Banc of California Credit Facility and 80.9 million under our BNP Facility, respectively, to meet our short-term contractual obligations, subject to contractual requirements and regulatory asset coverage requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had a payable for investments purchased of 14.7 million and 8.5 million in unfunded commitments to fund portfolio investments that can be funded with our current cash or credit facilities. 
 Long-term contractual obligations, such as our BNP Facility that matures in 2027 and had 69.1 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024, could be repaid by selling OFSCC-FS portfolio investments that have a fair value of 144.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The OFSCC-FS portfolio includes 38.2 million of broadly syndicated loans in larger portfolio companies that generally can be sold over a relatively short period to generate cash. We cannot, however, be certain that this source of funds will be available and upon terms acceptable to us in sufficient amounts in the future. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than its current fair value and incur significant realized losses on our invested capital. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 180.0 million of outstanding Unsecured Notes, of which 125.0 million matures on February 10, 2026. The Unsecured Notes Due February 2026 can be repaid by selling portfolio investments or by issuing additional senior securities to refinance the debt. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 50 of our outstanding debt matures in 2027 and beyond, 72 of our outstanding debt carries fixed interest rates and is unsecured. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have entered into contracts with third parties under which we have material future commitments the Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which OFS Advisor has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which OFS Services has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet. There is no guarantee that these amounts will be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. We continue to believe that we have sufficient levels of liquidity to support our existing portfolio companies and will meet these unfunded commitments by using our cash on hand or utilizing our available borrowings under the Banc of California Credit Facility and BNP Facility. In addition, we generally hold broadly syndicated loans in larger portfolio companies that can be sold over a relatively short period to generate cash. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than its current fair value and incur significant realized losses on our invested capital. 
 Distributions 
 We are taxed as a RIC under the Code. In order to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our ICTI, as defined by the Code. Additionally, to avoid a 4 excise tax on undistributed earnings we are required to distribute each calendar year the sum of: (i) 98 of our ordinary income for such calendar year; (ii) 98.2 of our net capital gains for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year; and (iii) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax. Maintenance of our RIC status requires adherence to certain source of income and asset diversification requirements. Generally, a RIC is entitled to deduct dividends it pays to its stockholders from its income to determine taxable income . Taxable income includes our taxable interest, dividend and fee income, and taxable net capital gains. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. In addition, gains realized for financial reporting purposes may differ from gains included in taxable income as a result of our election to recognize gains using installment sale treatment, which generally results in the deferment of gains for tax purposes until notes or other amounts, including amounts held in escrow received as consideration from the sale of investments, are collected in cash. Taxable income includes non-cash income, such as changes in accrued and reinvested interest and dividends, which includes contractual PIK interest, and the amortization of discounts and fees. Cash collections of income resulting from contractual PIK interest and dividends or the amortization of discounts and fees generally occur upon the repayment of the loans or debt securities that include such items. Non-cash taxable income is reduced by non-cash expenses, such as realized losses and depreciation, and amortization expense.

Our Board maintains a variable dividend policy with the objective of distributing quarterly distributions in an amount not less than 90-100 of our taxable quarterly income or potential annual income for a particular year. In addition, during the year, we may pay a special dividend, such that we may distribute approximately all of our annual taxable income in the year it was earned, while maintaining the option to spill over our excess taxable income to a following year. We may choose to retain a portion of our taxable income in any year and pay the 4 U.S. federal excise tax on the retained amounts. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated ICTI would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. The determination of the tax attributes of our distributions is made annually as of the end of our fiscal year based upon our estimated ICTI for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Each year, a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the source of the distribution is mailed to our stockholders. 
 Recent Developments 
 On October 29, 2024, our Board declared a distribution of 0.34 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. The economic effects of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the escalated armed conflict in the Middle East, interest rate changes and elevated inflation rates, ongoing supply chain and labor market disruptions, including those as a result of strikes, work stoppages or accidents, uncertainties related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, instability in the U.S. and international banking systems and the risk of recession or a shutdown of U.S. government services has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility has impacted and could continue to impact our market risks. For additional information concerning risks and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 5, 2024. 
 Investment Valuation Risk 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value a significant portion of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by OFS Advisor, as valuation designee, based, in part, on independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of OFS Advisor to assist in the valuation of most portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, some investments may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than its current fair value. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates as well as Notes 2 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information relating to our investment valuation. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, 91 of our loan portfolio, at fair value, bore interest at floating interest rates and contained interest rate reset provisions that adjust applicable interest rates to current rates on a periodic basis. The 50 basis point reduction in the U.S. Federal Reserve target federal funds rate effected in September 2024 influences SOFR-based rates, to which our variable rate debt investments are generally indexed. This rate decrease will likely result in our variable rate debt investments generating less interest income, all-else equal. Changes in interest rates, including potential additional interest rate reductions approved by the U.S. Federal Reserve, may impact our investment income, cost of funding and the valuation of our investments. Additional reductions in interest rates would reduce our interest income, which could in turn decrease our net investment income if such decreases in base interest rates are not offset by other factors, such as increases in the spread over such base interest rates or decreases in our operating expenses. 
 Our Unsecured Notes bear interest at fixed rates, which may result in net interest margin compression in a period of falling rates. As of September 30, 2024, our Banc of California Credit Facility and BNP Facility had floating interest rate provisions based on the applicable reference rates. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 1-month and 3-month SOFR were 4.85 and 4.59 , respectively. Assuming that the interim and unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following tables show the annualized impact of hypothetical changes in interest rate indices (in thousands). 
 Basis point increase Interest income Interest expense Net change 25 (233) (1) 
 149 (1) 
 (84) 50 315 (24) 291 75 863 (197) 666 100 1,411 (370) 1,041 125 1,959 (542) 1,417

Basis point decrease Interest income Interest expense Net change 25 (1,328) 494 (834) 50 (1,876) 667 (1209) 75 (2,424) 840 (1,584) 100 (2,971) 1,012 (1,959) 125 (3,519) 1,185 (2,334) 
 (1) A portion of the loan portfolio and our BNP Facility have yet to reset to comparatively lower current SOFR rates and a 25 basis point increase from current rates would still yield an interest rate lower than the current interest rate on these securities as of September 30, 2024. 
 Although we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of our net interest margin sensitivity to interest rate changes as of September 30, 2024, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our portfolio, and other business developments, including borrowings under our credit facilities, that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We, OFS Advisor and OFS Services, are not currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings threatened against us as of September 30, 2024. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business, including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company expects the Stock Repurchase Program to be in place through May 22, 2026, or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. The Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares, and all repurchases will be made in accordance with SEC Rule 10b-18, which sets certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of stock repurchases. The Stock Repurchase Program may be extended, modified or discontinued at any time for any reason. The Company retires all shares of common stock that it purchases in connection with the Stock Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, the approximate dollar value of shares remaining that may be purchased under the program was 9.6 million.

I. GENERAL (CODE OF ETHICS) 
 A. INTRODUCTION 
 The Code of Ethics Code has been jointly adopted by OFS Capital Management, OFS CLO Management, LLC, OFS CLO Management II, LLC and OFS CLO Management III, LLC (collectively, OFS Adviser or the Firm and certain entities that are controlled by or under common control with OFS Adviser Affiliates ), as determined from time to time by Senior Management, and each of OFS Capital Corporation, Hancock Park Corporate Income, Inc., OFS Credit Company, Inc. and any investment company that OFS Adviser may sponsor and or manage from time to time (each, an OFS Fund and collectively, OFS Funds in order to establish applicable policies, guidelines and procedures that promote ethical practices and conduct by all Supervised Persons of OFS Adviser, including, but not limited to, certain employees, interns, consultants, temporary employees, principals and others designated by the Compliance Department, and that prevent violations of applicable laws including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended Company Act ). 1 Supervised Person is defined as any director, officer, member or employee (or other person occupying similar status or performing similar functions) of OFS Adviser or any other person who provides investment advice on behalf of OFS Adviser and is subject to the supervision and control of OFS Adviser 2 . 
 Unless instructed otherwise or approved by the Compliance Department, temporary employees and consultants will generally be deemed a Supervised Person if the employee s or consultant s work assignment or engagement exceeds ninety (90) calendar days. This Code is available to all Supervised Persons on OFS Adviser s compliance portal. All Supervised Persons must read it carefully and certify at least annually (and at such other times that a Compliance Officer may request) that they have read and understand, and agree to abide by the Code. 
 The Code is designed to address conflicts of interest that may arise in an employee s personal dealings as well as those on behalf of the Firm and its Advisory Clients 3 . The following policies comprise the Code and address certain of these conflicts 
 the Personal Investment Policy, 
 
 1 The Code is adopted by OFS Adviser and each OFS Fund pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of each of Rules 204A-1 and 206(4)- 7 under the Advisers Act and Rules 17j-1 and 38a-1under the Company Act. 
 2 The Chief Compliance Officer or his her designee may consider any director, officer, member, principal or employee, including, but not limited to, intern, consultants and temporary employees, of an Affiliate of OFS Adviser to be a Supervised Person of OFS Adviser if the Chief Compliance Officer determines that such person performs services for OFS Adviser, through any staffing or similar agreement, such that the person would constitute a Supervised Person if such person was a director, officer, member, employee, intern or temporary employee of OFS Adviser. The Compliance Department maintains a list of all such persons and whether each person is (1) a Supervised Person and (2) an Access Person and will notify each person of relevant requirements. The majority of OFS Adviser s personnel are employees of Orchard First Source Capital, Inc., an Affiliate of OFS Adviser. 
 3 Advisory Client means any individual, group of individuals, partnership, trust, company or other investment fund entity for whom OFS Adviser acts as investment adviser. For example, any OFS Fund is an Advisory Client. For the avoidance of doubt, Advisory Clients include public and private investment funds, including comingled funds and single investor funds Funds and managed accounts managed by OFS Adviser, but do not include the underlying individual investors in such Funds Investors ), although certain protections afforded to Advisory Clients pursuant to this Code do extend to Investors through Rule 206(4)-8 of the Advisers Act.

Examples of such conflicts include

Accordingly, no Supervised Person may maliciously create, disseminate or use false rumors. This prohibition covers oral and written communications, including the use of electronic communication media such as e-mail, PIN messages, instant messages, tweets, text messages, blogs, and chat rooms. Because of the difficulty identifying false rumors, the Firm discourages Supervised Persons from creating, passing, or using any rumor. 
 C. PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTING AND TRAININ G 
 Each Supervised Person is required to complete all assigned compliance certifications, disclosures and trainings by the Compliance Due Date. Absent an exemption granted to you by a Compliance Officer, failure to complete such items by the Compliance Due Date will likely constitute a violation of this Code and may result in the imposition of sanctions. 
 The Compliance Department also presents and or coordinates mandatory training on this Code at least biennially and may assign mandatory or voluntary training on the Code or other Firm policies at such other times as the Compliance Department deems appropriate. Failure to attend or complete mandatory training sessions, unless excused in writing by a Compliance Officer, will likely constitute a violation of this Code and may lead to the imposition of sanctions. The Compliance Department maintains an attendance or completion list, as appropriate, of all Supervised Persons assigned to such training sessions.

F. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND WAIVERS BY OFS ADVISER AND THE OFS FUNDS

II. PERSONAL INVESTMENT POLICY 
 A. INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS 
 The Advisers Act, specifically Rule 204A-1, requires Access Persons of a registered investment adviser, such as OFS Adviser, to provide periodic reports regarding transactions and holdings in Reportable Securities (as defined below) beneficially owned by Access Persons. Rule 17j-1 under the Company Act requires similar reports for Access Persons to a Fund, such as each of the OFS Funds. 
 The purpose of this Personal Investment Policy and related procedures is to advise Access Persons of their ethical and legal responsibilities with respect to Securities transactions that may involve (i) possible conflicts of interest with Advisory Clients, including the OFS Funds, and (ii) the possession and use of material, nonpublic information MNPI ). It is a violation of the Code for any Access Person of OFS Adviser or any OFS Fund to use their knowledge concerning a trade, pending trade, or contemplated trade or investment by an OFS Fund or any other Advisory Client to profit personally, directly or indirectly, as a result of such transaction, including by purchasing or selling such Securities. 
 The following definitions are utilized within this Personal Investments Policy and more broadly within the rest of the Code. 
 Access Person with respect to OFS Adviser means (a) any Supervised Person who (i) has access to nonpublic information regarding any Advisory Client s purchase or sale of Securities, or nonpublic information regarding the portfolio holdings of any Advisory Client (including any OFS Fund) or (ii) is involved in making Securities recommendations to Advisory Clients (including any OFS Fund), or has access to such recommendations that are nonpublic and (b) all directors, officers and partners of OFS Adviser. 5

The Compliance Department will maintain a list of all such persons and whether each person is (1) a Supervised Person and (2) an Access Person and will notify each person of relevant requirements.

Reportable Security means every Security and Reportable Fund in which an Access Person or a Related Person has a Beneficial Ownership or other Beneficial Interest, except for an Exempt Security.

 B. PRECLEARANCE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 Under the Advisers Act and the Company Act, OFS Adviser and each OFS Fund are required to keep records of transactions in Reportable Securities in which Access Persons have Beneficial Ownership or a direct or indirect Beneficial Interest. 
 In most cases, determining whether an Access Person or his or her Related Person has Beneficial Ownership of, or a Beneficial Interest in the Reportable Securities held in an account (which would make such account an Affiliated Account for purposes hereof) is a straight-forward process. It is, however, important to note that, in some cases, an owner of an equity interest in an entity may be considered to have Beneficial Ownership of the assets of that entity. In general, equity holders are not deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of Securities held by an entity that is not controlled by the equity holders or in which the equity holders do not have or share investment control over the entity s portfolio. Because the determination of whether an equity holder controls an entity or its investment decisions can be complicated, Access Persons are encouraged to seek guidance from a Compliance Officer. To the extent such guidance is not sought, any failure by an Access Person to properly identify all Affiliated Accounts will be treated as a violation of the Code. 

6 Note that, for most purposes, evidences of indebtedness are treated as Securities for securities law purposes insider trading prohibitions are an exception to this general rule.

 All Access Persons and Related Persons must submit preclearance requests for all transactions in Publicly Traded Reportable Securities in Non-Managed Accounts. Preclearance requests shall be made through the Firm s compliance portal. A record of such approval (or denial), and a brief description of the reasoning supporting such decision will be maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of the Advisers Act and the Company Act. 
 Preclearance authorization for publicly traded Reportable Securities is effective until the next market close following the approval, unless explicitly extended or revoked by a Compliance Officer. If the approved transaction is not completed by the next close of market trading, the Access Person must submit a new pre-approval request and again receive approval from a Compliance Officer for the relevant transaction. Market close is determined by the exchange on which the security, selected by the Access Person, is traded.

 If a trade is approved during market trading hours, the Access or Related Person will have until market close on the same day the approval was granted to complete the trade. If the approved transaction is not completed during market hours on the same day, a new preclearance request must be submitted. 
 If a trade is approved after market close, the Access or Related Person will have until market close on the following trading day to complete the trade. 
 Preclearance requests may be rejected for any reason a Compliance Officer deems appropriate, but requests related to personal securities trades that would violate the provisions of the Statement of Restrictions section below, including but not limited to the No Front Running section, or the Restricted List or Trades of OFS Funds Directors sections below, will generally be rejected.

 Within sixty (60) calendar days of becoming an Access Person, every new Access Person must transfer all Non-Managed Accounts in which Reportable Securities are held or are capable of being held to a broker-dealer to which the Compliance Department has access via the Firm s compliance portal (an Approved Broker ). Subsequently, any new Non-Managed Accounts opened on behalf of such Access Person or his or her Related Person in which Reportable Securities will be held or transacted must be established with an Approved Broker. The Compliance Department maintains a list of Approved Brokers, which can be found on the Firm s compliance portal site.

3. Managed Accounts 
 The Firm recognizes that it may be impossible or impractical for accounts that are controlled or invested on a fully discretionary basis by a third party, such as an investment adviser or broker Managed Accounts ), to comply with the Preclearance and Reporting Requirements section and Statement of Restrictions section of the Code. Therefore, Managed Accounts are exempted from such procedures, provided that the Access Person cedes any and all control over investment decisions for the account (other than general asset class and objectives guidelines) to such third party and does not communicate with such person with respect to individual transactions for the account. Special rules apply with respect to whether an Access Person controls the investment decisions of an entity in which he or she invests guidance from a Compliance Officer should be sought in such instances. 
 The Firm requires that general information regarding Managed Accounts, including broker, account title, account number, and the status of the account, be reported through the Firm s compliance portal. In order to properly establish a Managed Account, the Access Persons is required to provide to the Compliance Department evidence that full investment discretion has been provided to the third-party investment adviser or broker (e.g., provide the investment management agreement or a letter from the investment adviser broker attesting that it has full investment discretion over the Access Persons or their Related Persons account). Upon establishing a Managed Account in the Firm s compliance portal and quarterly thereafter, the Access Person is required to certify within the Firm s compliance portal that he or she does not participate, directly or indirectly in individual investment decisions in the Managed Account or be made aware of such decisions before transactions are executed. 
 4. Non-Transferable Accounts 
 The Firm recognizes that it may be impossible or impracticable for certain types of Non- Managed Accounts (e.g. 401(k) accounts) of Access Persons or their Related Persons with other employers, or an account pledged to secure a personal loan, etc. to be transferred to an Approved Broker. A Compliance Officer may exempt any such Non-Managed Account from the Approved Broker procedures set forth above provided that the Access Person shall be responsible for reporting transactions and holdings of Reportable Securities (e.g. employer shares) in such account as set forth above and complying with the Statement of Restrictions section of the Code with respect to such Non- Managed Accounts. 
 The Firm requires that all such non-transferable Non-Managed Accounts be reported to the Compliance Department so that an exemption may properly be granted. General information regarding such accounts must be reported through the Firm s compliance portal. A Compliance Officer may, as a condition to exempting such Affiliated Accounts, require, initially and periodically thereafter, copies of account statements, a certification from the Access Person, or such other information as such Compliance Officer deems prudent.

5. Transactions Subject to Review 
 Transactions and holding information reported via the Firm s compliance portal will be reviewed by a Compliance Officer and compared against the investments made or considered by each of the Advisory Clients. Such review and comparison are designed to evaluate compliance with the Code and, further, to determine whether there have been any violations of applicable law. Reporting made by a Compliance Officer is reviewed by a different Compliance Officer so that no Compliance Officer is reviewing his or her own reporting.

The request to liquidate must be made by the New Hire prior to his or her start date by completing the Request to Place a Liquidating Trade in a Restricted Security form, which can be obtained from Compliance. Compliance will review each request on a case-by-case basis and approve or deny the request, assessing all available and relevant information .

Personal Securities Trades made in accordance with a Predetermined Schedule by Access Persons who serve on the board of directors of such companies are exempt from the restriction against trading in Securities added to the Restricted List after the adoption of the Predetermined Schedule, however such Predetermined Schedules must be provided to Compliance prior to any transaction conducted pursuant to the relevant Predetermined Schedule. Such transactions are also subject to the reporting requirements set forth in Section B Preclearance and Reporting Requirements. Further, purchases and

sales of Securities by such company s directors during an established trading window may be permitted with prior notice to, and at the discretion of, a Compliance Officer. 
 
 6. No Personal Trades Through OFS Adviser s Traders 
 No Personal Securities Trades may be effected through OFS Adviser s trading personnel. 
 7. Use of Brokerage for Personal or Family Benefit 
 No Access Person may, for direct or indirect personal or a Related Persons benefit, execute a trade with a broker by using the influence (actual or implied) of OFS Adviser or any Access Person s influence (actual or implied) with OFS Adviser. 
 8. Short Sale Transactions 
 No Access Person or Related Person may enter into a short sale transaction or any transaction that has the same economic effect (e.g., inverse single stock ETF, short common stock, purchase a put option or sell a naked call option) on any Security of an issuer for which a position is held long by an Advisory Client. Before Access Persons or their Related Person makes a short sale transaction, the Access Person must submit a pre-clearance request through the Fim s compliance portal to engage in a short transaction on a Security. 
 9. Acquiring Five (5) Percent or more of a Publicly Traded Company 
 Access Persons are required to report to a Compliance Officer, via the Firm s compliance portal, any ownership exceeding 5 of a class of equity securities of a publicly traded company that they or their Related Persons or Family Members have a beneficial interest in. 

7 A Rule 10b5-1 plan is a written plan for trading Securities that is designed in accordance with Rule 105-1(c). Any person executing pre-planned transactions pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan that was established in good faith at a time when that person was unaware of material nonpublic information has an affirmative defense against accusations of insider trading, even if actual trades made pursuant to the plan are executed at a time when the individual may be aware of material nonpublic information.

III. INSIDE INFORMATION POLICY 
 
 A. INTRODUCTION 
 The prohibitions against insider trading set forth in the federal securities laws play an essential role in maintaining the fairness, health, and integrity of our markets. These laws also establish fundamental standards of business conduct that govern our daily activities and help to ensure that Advisory Client s trust and confidence are not compromised in any way. Consistent with these principles, OFS Adviser forbids any Supervised Person from (i) trading Securities for the Firm, any Advisory Client or any account in which a Supervised Person has a Beneficial Interest, if that Supervised Person is aware of material and nonpublic information MNPI or Inside Information concerning an issuer or (ii) communicating MNPI to others in violation of the law. This conduct is frequently referred to as insider trading. This policy applies to all Supervised Persons, and extends to activities within and outside of each Supervised Person s duties at OFS Adviser or with any OFS Fund. 
 The term insider trading is not specifically defined under the federal securities laws (most guidance in this area can be found under case law and related judicial decisions), but generally is used to refer to improper trading in Securities 8 on the basis of MNPI (whether or not the person trading is an insider). A person is generally deemed to trade on the basis of MNPI if that person is aware of MNPI when making the purchase or sale, regardless of whether the person specifically relied on the information in making an investment decision. It is generally understood that the law prohibits trading by an insider on the basis of MNPI about the Security or issuer. To be held liable under the law, the person trading generally must violate a duty of trust or confidence owed directly, indirectly or derivatively to the issuer of that Security or the shareholders of that issuer, or to any other person who is the source of the material nonpublic information (e.g., an employer). The law also prohibits the communication of inside information to others and provides for penalties and punitive damages against the tipper even if he or she does not gain personally from the improper trading. 

8 OFS Adviser often transacts in syndicated or other loan interests on the basis of information that is not available to other members of the syndicate, or to the public in general however, for the limited purpose of this policy, Securities (as defined in the Exchange Act) do not include such loan interests or other evidences of indebtedness. If you are uncertain as to whether a particular investment is a security for purposes of this policy, contact the Legal Compliance Department

B. KEY TERMS 
 1. What is a Security 
 The Exchange Act, which covers insider trading, defines Security very broadly to include most types of financial instruments, 9 except bank debt 10 . There may be instances where Supervised Persons receive information about such investments that is not generally known by other institutional investors - even those institutional investors who may be similarly situated (e.g., lenders that are privy to nonpublic information and have access to bank-level information or primary lender meetings). Although trading in non-security investments on the basis of nonpublic information is not prohibited by federal securities laws, such trading may be prohibited by fiduciary obligations, other federal or state statutes, or contractual obligations such as confidentiality agreements 11 . In situations where OFS Adviser has access to MNPI to which other potential investors counterparties may not have access, Supervised Persons should consult with a Compliance Officer or Senior Management, as appropriate, as to whether a proposed purchase or sale of an investment should be made, and, if made, should include the use of a Big Boy letter (see the Firm s Confidentiality Policy), a confidentiality agreement (see the Firm s Confidentiality Policy), or, if the investment is a syndicated loan, the execution by OFS Adviser of the standard LSTA form, which includes disclosure concerning the possibility of access to such information. In addition, even if trading in a non-security investment is permissible because the above standards are met, Supervised Persons are still prohibited from trading in any Securities issued by the relevant borrower, either for an Advisory Client or themselves, if the information obtained would be material with respect to the Securities transaction. This would also include indirect participation in such a transaction for example, by participating in an Investment Committee meeting in which a decision regarding such Securities was being considered. 
 2. Who is an Insider 
 The concept of an insider is broad. It includes officers, directors, and employees of a company. In addition, a person can be a temporary insider if he or she enters into a special 
 
 9 For purposes of the Inside Information Policy, Security means any note, stock, treasury stock, security feature, security-based swap, bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or lease, any collateral- trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly known as a security or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing but shall not include currency or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker's acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited. 
 10 Note that, for most purposes, evidences of indebtedness are treated as securities for securities law purposes insider trading prohibitions are an exception to this general rule. 
 11 The Compliance Department maintains the Private Company List and Advisory Clients may not transact in these investments unless an exception to the prohibition from trading a security on the Private Company List has been granted by the CCO or his or her designee. Please refer to the Confidentiality Policy for more information. 

 25

confidential relationship in the conduct of a company s affairs and as a result is given access to information solely for the company s purposes. A temporary insider can include, among others, a company s attorneys, accountants, consultants, bank lending officers, investment advisers (such as OFS Adviser) and the employees of such organizations. OFS Adviser may become a temporary insider by signing a confidentiality agreement or by accessing material nonpublic information of a public issuer via a private electronic workspace. 
 3. What is Material Information 
 Trading on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the information is deemed material. Material information generally is defined as information with respect to which there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making his or her investment decisions, or information that could reasonably be expected to have a substantial effect on the price of a company s Securities. 
 Among other things, the following types of information are generally regarded as material 
 dividend or earnings announcements 
 write-downs or write-offs of assets 
 additions to reserves for bad debts or contingent liabilities 
 expansion or curtailment of company or major division operations 
 merger, joint venture announcements 
 new product service marketing announcements 
 new supplier manufacturing production announcements 
 material charge impairment announcements 
 senior management changes 
 changes in control 
 material restatement of previously issued financial statements 
 discovery or research developments 
 criminal indictments and civil and government investigations, litigations and or settlements 
 pending labor disputes 
 debt service or liquidity problems 
 bankruptcy or insolvency problems 
 tender offers, stock repurchase plans, etc. 
 recapitalizations 
 Material information does not have to relate to a company s business. For example, in Carpenter v. U.S. , 18 U.S. 316 (1987), the Supreme Court considered as material certain information about the contents of a forthcoming newspaper column that was expected to affect the market price of a Security. In that case, a Wall Street Journal reporter was found criminally liable for disclosing to others the dates that reports on various companies would appear in the Journal and whether those reports would be favorable or not.

4. What is Nonpublic Information 
 Information is nonpublic until it has been effectively communicated to the marketplace. One must be able to point to some fact to show that the information is generally public. For example, information found in a report filed with the SEC, or appearing in Dow Jones , Reuters Economic Services , The Wall Street Journal , Bloomberg, or other publications of general circulation would be considered public. Supervised Persons should seek specific guidance from a Compliance Officer in situations where information concerning an issuer or its affiliated entities (e.g., subsidiaries) may not have been made available to the investment community generally but was made available to a group of institutional investors. 
 5. Contacts with Companies 
 From time to time, Supervised Persons may meet with members of senior management at publicly-traded companies associated with an investment deal or a prospective investment deal. OFS Adviser may make investment decisions on the basis of the Firm s conclusions formed through such contacts and analysis of publicly-available information regarding foreign and U.S. companies. Difficult legal issues arise when, during these contacts, a Supervised Person becomes aware of MNPI about those companies. This could happen, for example, if a company s chief financial officer prematurely discloses quarterly results to a Supervised Person, a broker, or a securities analyst, or if an investor relations representative makes a selective disclosure of adverse news to a handful of investors. In such situations, Supervised Persons should immediately contact a Compliance Officer if he or she believes that he or she may have received MNPI about a publicly traded company. 
 6. Tender Offers 
 Tender offers raise heightened concerns in the law of insider trading for two reasons. First, tender offer activity often produces gyrations in the price of the target company s Securities. Trading during this period is more likely to attract regulatory attention (and produces a disproportionate percentage of insider trading cases). Second, the SEC has adopted a rule which expressly forbids trading and tipping while in possession of MNPI regarding a tender offer received from the tender offeror, the target company or anyone acting on behalf of either. Supervised Persons should exercise caution any time they become aware of nonpublic information relating to a tender offer. 
 7. Shadow Trading 
 Shadow Trading occurs when a Supervised Person possesses MNPI regarding a company and trades in the securities of another company that is economically linked to the company for which that Supervised Person has MNPI. Economically Linked is the concept that MNPI about one issuer could likely affect the price of the securities of another issuer due to being in the same sector, employing the same service providers, being subject to the same cybersecurity failings, etc. that are in the same sector or subsector in predictable ways. An SEC insider trading case claiming a defendant engaged in impermissible insider trading through shadow trading was upheld in a court case in April 2024, see SEC v. Matthew Panuwat . Supervised Persons should be aware that the SEC considers 

 27 
 
 Page -27- 
 OFS Capital Management Confidential. Do not copy or distribute. 

shadow trading to be insider trading and ensure they do not engage in transactions in economically linked securities while in possession of MNPI about a different, closely correlated issuer (securities of companies in the same industry). For example, a Supervised Person obtains MNPI regarding Southwest Airlines discovery of a significant defect in its Boeing 737 planes, which is expected to cause its stock price to decline once that news is made available to the public. The Supervised Person then uses that information to short Alaska Airlines stock, as Alaska Airlines also primarily utilizes Boeing 737 s in their fleet and its stock is likely to be affected in the same way as they are in the same industry and economically linked . 
 8. Penalties for Insider Trading 
 Penalties for trading on or inappropriately communicating MNPI are severe, both for the individuals involved and their employers. A person can be subject to some or all of the penalties below, even if he or she does not personally benefit from the violations. Penalties include 
 civil injunctions 
 disgorgement of profits 
 punitive damages (i.e., fines for the person who committed the violation of up to three (3) times the profit gained, or loss avoided, irrespective of whether the person actually benefited personally) 
 felony convictions which include possible jail sentences and 
 fines and sanctions against the employer or other controlling person. 
 
 C. INSIDER TRADING PROCEDURES 
 The following procedures have been established to assist Supervised Persons in avoiding insider trading, and to aid OFS Adviser in preventing, detecting, and imposing sanctions for insider trading. The following procedures should be read in conjunction with other policies set forth in this Code, and in the Compliance Policies. 
 1. Identifying MNPI 
 Before trading in the Securities of a company about which they may have potential MNPI, Supervised Persons should ask themselves the following questions 
 Is the information material Is this information that an investor would consider important in making his or her investment decisions (e.g., whether the investor should buy, sell, or hold a Security) Is this information that would substantially affect the market price of the Securities if generally disclosed 

28 
 
 Page -28- 
 OFS Capital Management Confidential. Do not copy or distribute. 

Is the information nonpublic To whom has this information been provided Has the information been effectively communicated to the marketplace by being published in Reuters , The Wall Street Journal , Bloomberg, or other publications of general circulation Remember that information that has been communicated to a relatively large group of sophisticated investors does not by itself mean that the information is public (e.g., large group of potential bank debt investors during an invitation only meeting). 
 2. Restricting Access to MNPI 
 Care should be taken so that MNPI is secure. For example, files containing MNPI should be sealed or locked access to computer files containing MNPI should be restricted. As a general matter, materials containing such information should not be removed from the Firm s premises and, if they are, appropriate measures should be maintained to protect the materials from loss or disclosure. Among other things, Supervised Persons should 
 distribute materials containing MNPI only on a need-to-know basis 
 take care so that telephone conversations cannot be overheard when discussing matters involving MNPI (e.g., speaker telephones should generally be used in a way so that outsiders who might be in OFS Advisers offices are not inadvertently exposed to this information) 
 limit access to offices and conference rooms when these rooms contain MNPI and 
 not leave materials containing MNPI displayed on the computer screen when they leave their computers unattended. 
 3. Review and Dissemination of Certain Investment Related Information 
 As part of its consideration of certain investments, including in certain types of non-Securities (e.g., bank debt instruments), the Firm may enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties (e.g., issuers, sponsors, syndicate members or other lenders) that could have implications for the Firm s compliance with federal securities laws. Those agreements may sometimes contain so-called stand- still provisions, which specifically restrict the Firm s activity in Securities of identified issuers, but more typically simply raise the possibility that nonpublic information may be disclosed to the recipient and seek the receiving party s acknowledgment of that understanding and agreement not to disclose any MNPI transmitted. The procedures for executing confidentiality agreements are set forth in the Firm s Confidentiality Policy. Many potential counterparties or their agents specifically require that potential investors sign a confidentiality agreement before they will be provided access to investment- related information. Because of the importance of our policies regarding access to and use of confidential information, confidentiality agreements may only be reviewed, negotiated, and executed as set forth in the Firm s Confidentiality Policy.

4. Determination of Materiality 
 Given the unique asset classes in which OFS Adviser typically invests, Supervised Persons may receive detailed information about a Security that may not be otherwise readily available to the investing public. The issue of materiality and the ultimate determination as to whether the information provided rises to the level of MNPI should not be made independently by a Supervised Person. Rather, the employee should contact the Compliance Department to conduct a materiality assessment and an informed determination may be made. Unless otherwise determined by the Compliance Department, in consultation with investment staff and outside legal counsel, as appropriate, information received about a publicly-traded Security that is not readily available to the investing public shall be deemed to be and treated as material. 
 5. Use of Expert Networks 
 While it is permissible to utilize Expert Networks, which provide information, advice, analysis, market expertise or industry experience for use in the due diligence process of a potential investment, formulating investment views or on-going oversight of current investments, OFS Adviser must be particularly sensitive about the information that these Expert Networks provide. Accordingly, OFS Adviser has adopted an Expert Network Policy which governs the contact and interaction with Expert Networks, and requires Supervised Persons to obtain preapproval from the Compliance Department before engaging an Expert Network. OFS Adviser s Expert Network Policy is hereby incorporated into this Code by reference. Those Supervised Person who have been approved to use Expert Networks are required to fully comply with all policies, procedures, certifications and training requirements associated with the Expert Network Policy, and any instance of non-compliance will likely constitute a violation of the Code. 
 6. Value-Added Investors 
 Certain investors, who are affiliated with public companies, can pose additional risk for Supervised Persons exposure to MNPI. The SEC has coined the term value-added investors VAIs to refer to these types of investors. VAIs are investors with whom OFS Advisor has direct contact (i.e., those investors of OFS Advisory Clients with whom OFS Advisor has ongoing relationships and not investors who interact with OFS Advisor for one off purposes) and are 
 Public company executives, officers, directors, or corporate insiders who may possess or have access to MNPI due to their position and 
 Executives, principals or portfolio managers at investment firms such as hedge funds, investment advisers, broker-dealers, or investment banks who may possess or have access to MNPI due to the nature of their position. 
 The Compliance Department maintains a VAI List. Certain OFS Supervised Persons who are responsible for interfacing with VAIs OFS VAI Contacts will promptly contact the Compliance Department if they become aware of a VAI and or provide updates to the VAI List and attest to their compliance with the VAI policy on a quarterly basis. The Compliance Department will assess the 

 30

names on the VAI List and request additional information, as necessary, and add those issuers identified as associated with a VAI to the Watch List, as appropriate. 
 If you become aware of a current or prospective investor that could be considered a VAI or have questions regarding this policy, please contact the Compliance Department.

IV. GIFTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND POLITICAL ACTIVITIES 
 A. INTRODUCTION 
 OFS Adviser attempts to minimize any activity that might give rise to a question as to whether the Firm s objectivity as a fiduciary has been compromised. 
 B. GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT POLICY 
 One possible area of fiduciary concern relates to providing or receiving meals, gifts, entertainment or anything of value from third parties with which OFS Adviser or its Advisory Clients do business, including each OFS Fund, joint business partners, service providers and current and prospective clients (collectively Outside Parties and each an Outside Party ). 
 Supervised Persons are prohibited from soliciting anything of value from Outside Parties. Further, no Supervised Person may give or receive any gift, meal or entertainment that could or is intended to influence decision-making or to make a person beholden, in any way, to another person or company that seeks to do or is currently doing business with the Firm or its Advisory Clients. Lavish or luxurious gifts and entertainment, and gifts and entertainment that are received or provided on a frequent basis, are generally deemed to meet this standard and, unless a Compliance Officer indicates otherwise, are prohibited. In addition, depending upon a Supervised Person s responsibilities, specific regulatory requirements may dictate the types and extent of gifts and entertainment that Supervised Persons may give or receive. The Firm is committed to competing solely on the merit of its products and services, and Supervised Persons should avoid any actions that create a perception that favorable treatment of Outside Parties by the Firm was sought, received or given in exchange for a particular decision or action. 
 1. Business Meals 
 Generally, Supervised Persons may share food and beverages (meals) with Outside Parties in the ordinary course of business. Meals received by Supervised Persons from Outside Parties should not exceed 250 per person per meal, unless preapproved by Compliance. Meals provided by Supervised Persons to Outside Parties are generally permissible and should also not exceed 250 per person per meal, unless preapproved by Compliance . No food or beverage should be provided to Public Officials without preclearance and preapproval by Compliance . 

32

2. Providing Business Gifts 
 Any Supervised Person who offers a gift to an Outside Party must be sure that it cannot reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to gain an unfair business advantage or otherwise reflect negatively upon the Firm. In addition, a Supervised Person may never use personal funds or resources to do something that cannot be done with Firm resources. A gift may include any services or merchandise of any kind or discounts on merchandise or services and other items of value. Generally, Supervised Persons are prohibited from giving gifts of cash, cash equivalents (such as gift cards and gift certificates) and securities to Outside Parties . This policy does not prohibit the provision of occasional or nominal non-cash gift items, such as holiday gifts, to Outside Parties so long as the amount provided by a Supervised Person to any one recipient over a calendar year does not exceed 250. Once the aggregate amount proposed to be provided by a Supervised Person to any one recipient during one calendar year exceeds 250, that Supervised Person must submit a preclearance request and obtain preapproval via the Firm s compliance portal. Further, anything of value (e.g., meals, beverages, gifts, and entertainment) to be provided to Public Officials requires preclearance approval via the Firm s compliance portal . 
 The Compliance Department shall periodically review gifts provided for compliance with this Code as part of quarterly expense reimbursement review process. 
 If you are unsure of OFS Adviser s policy with respect to providing gifts in any circumstance, you should consult with a Compliance Officer. 
 3. Receiving Business Gifts 
 No Supervised Person should obtain any material personal benefits or favors because of his or her position with the Firm. Each Supervised Person s decisions on behalf of the Firm must be free from undue influence. Soliciting gifts from Outside Parties is strictly prohibited. A gift may include any services or merchandise of any kind or discounts on merchandise or services and other items of value. Supervised Persons are prohibited from receiving gifts of cash, cash equivalents (such as gift cards and gift certificates) and securities from Outside Parties. This policy does not prohibit the receipt of occasional or nominal non-cash gift items, such as holiday gifts, so long as the amount received by a Supervised Person from any one source over a calendar year does not exceed 250. Any gift that will cause the total received by that Supervised Person from a single source to exceed 250 for the calendar year, and any additional gift thereafter received during the calendar year, requires preclearance by a Compliance Officer. Also, one of the following actions will generally be required return the gift, donate the gift to charity or to OFS for a corporate raffle or keep the gift and write a check to charity for the difference between the fair market value of the gift and 250. Such requests should be submitted via the Firm s compliance portal. 

 33 
 
 Page -33- 
 OFS Capital Management Confidential. Do not copy or distribute. 

Gifts in any amount received by a Supervised Person from an Outside Party, except for gifts of nominal value (such as logo items, including pens, notepads, coffee mugs and baseball caps) must be disclosed in the Firm s compliance portal at the time of receipt. 
 4. Entertainment 
 The gift policies above are not intended to prohibit the acceptance or provision of non- extravagant entertainment that facilitates the handling of the Firm s business. Business entertainment (e.g., concerts, exhibitions or sporting events, where the person providing the entertainment is present), that is not frequent or lavish and does not influence the selection of vendors or other Outside Parties, is acceptable. Entertainment received by a Supervised Person where the outside party providing the entertainment is not in attendance is considered a gift. From time to time, an employee may have the opportunity to invite a guest to a business entertainment event hosted by an Outside Party the guest s ticket is considered as a gift for purposes of this policy. Business meals are not considered entertainment for purposes of this Policy (see Section IV.B. 1. Business Meals above for additional information). 
 No Supervised Person may provide or accept extravagant or excessive entertainment to or from an Outside Party. Any entertainment that a Supervised Person reasonably expects to exceed 1,000 in market value per person must be pre-approved by a Compliance Officer . Also, if the entertainment provided by the Supervised Person is part of an entertainment program (e.g., purchasing season box seats, where multiple events are scheduled over multiple dates, for multiple Outside Parties), and although the market value per person may be below the 1000 limit, these programs must also be approved in advance by a Compliance Officer. Further, entertainment of any value to be provided to Public Officials requires pre-approval from a Compliance Officer. Such requests should be submitted via the Firm s compliance portal. 
 A Supervised Person receiving entertainment in an amount less than the 1,000 limit must disclose the entertainment via the Firm s compliance portal. The disclosure should be made no later than 30 calendar days of the date of participating in such event. 
 5. Travel and Lodging 
 Supervised Persons may occasionally be invited to conferences or other events by Outside Parties, which include an offer of travel and or lodging. Employees must contact a Compliance Officer to obtain approval prior to accepting the travel and or lodging. Requests to accept travel or lodging that appear to be extravagant or frequent in nature will generally be prohibited. 
 6. Giving Gifts, Entertainment and Meals to Public Officials 
 Specific requirements and restrictions apply regarding the offering of meals, gifts and entertainment (including any food and beverages) to Public Officials and can vary depending on the governmental branch body, state, or other jurisdiction. For example, many government pension plans 

 34 
 
 Page -34- 
 OFS Capital Management Confidential. Do not copy or distribute. 

place strict limits on the value of any meal provided by a service provider, such as the Firm, to the pension plans employees. Certain jurisdictions even ban service providers from providing anything of value to their public employees, including promotional items of nominal value. Penalties for violating these gift laws can range from monetary fines to disqualification from RFP participation and rescindment of existing investment mandates. Private unions are subject to Department of Labor gift rules and regulations and service providers, such as the Firm, must comply with prescribed limits and reporting requirements when providing gifts and entertainment (including any food and beverages) to union employees. Accordingly, it is against Firm policy to offer or give gifts, entertainment (including any food and beverages), or anything of value to Public Officials or union officials or employees unless the regulations applicable to that individual permit acceptance of such items. Further, Supervised Persons are required to obtain preclearance from a Compliance Officer to offer or give anything of value, including nominal items or snacks, to Public Officials or union officials or employees. Such requests for prior approval should be submitted via the Firm s compliance portal. 
 If you plan to contact a Public Official for the first time in order to solicit business or to request that any action or decision be made by a Public Official or its affiliated public body, you may need to register as a lobbyist. Many states and other local jurisdictions have enacted lobbying laws that can vary in how they define lobbying and registration as a lobbyist is required. Further, in the event that you are required to register as a lobbyist, you will likely be subject to lower gift and entertainment limits. Accordingly, you should contact Compliance for further guidance prior to initial contact with Public Officials. 
 If you are unsure of applicable laws, rules, and regulations with respect to providing gifts, meals and entertainment (including any food or beverages) to Public Officials or union official or employees in any circumstance, you should consult with a Compliance Officer. 
 7. Receiving Gifts or Entertainment from Traders or Brokers Agent Bank Employees 
 Traders or other investment professionals with the ability to influence the selection of brokers agent banks with respect to trading in Securities and broadly syndicated loans are prohibited from receiving meals over 250 and gifts or entertainment of any value from an employee of such broker agent bank without submitting a preclearance request and receiving preapproval from Compliance. Such request for pre-approval should be submitted via the Firm s compliance portal. 
 8. Charitable Contributions 
 The following charitable contributions require preclearance by a Compliance Officer 
 8.1 Charitable contributions by OFS Advisers and or its affiliated operating entities . 
 Such contributions may be permissible only with the approval of Senior Management and 

35 
 
 Page -35- 
 OFS Capital Management Confidential. Do not copy or distribute. 

requested through the Firm s compliance portal. The Compliance Officer will consult with Senior Management if such requests are not initiated by a member of Senior Management. 
 8.2 Charitable contributions by OFS Funds, separately managed accounts and investment vehicles . 
 Such contributions generally must, at a minimum (1) provide a direct benefit to the contributing entity (2) require the preliminary approval of the Senior Managing Director and (3) be consistent with the contributing entity s governing documents. If the proposed contribution amount exceeds the entity s applicable budget, a member of Senior Management must also approve the contribution prior to submitting a preclearance request through the Firm s compliance portal. 
 8.3 Charitable contributions by an employee, at the request or for the benefit of a Public Official or a Public Official s immediate family member or close associate . 
 Such contributions may be permissible only if the Compliance Officer can reasonably conclude that the contribution is lawful, ethical and in compliance with the policies and standards under this Code. 
 In all cases, unless an exception has been granted by a Compliance Officer, the beneficiary of the contribution must be an organization formed under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or is otherwise operating exclusively as a non-profit civic charity that is not involved in any political or lobbying activity. Further, such contributions should never be used as bribes (i.e., to improperly influence or reward any action or decision for OFS s benefit). 
 C. POLITICAL ACTIVITY POLICY 
 1. Introduction 
 The SEC, along with certain states, municipalities and public pension plans, have adopted regulations limiting or completely disqualifying investment advisers from providing services to, or accepting placements from, a government entity if certain political contributions 12 are made or solicited 13 by the Firm, certain of its Supervised Persons, or, in some instances, a Supervised Person s Related Persons.

practically every level of government (including local, state and federal) may preclude the Firm from providing services to, or accepting placements from, the applicable government entity and may compel the firm to repay compensation received by the Firm for with such services or placements. 
 OFS Adviser and its Affiliates (other than natural persons, as provided below) generally do not make or solicit contributions in any amount to any federal, state, county or local political campaign, candidate or officeholder, or any political organization (e.g., political party committee and political action committee PAC )). As such, Supervised Persons are prohibited from making or soliciting contributions in the name of or on behalf of OFS Advisers and or its Affiliates unless otherwise approved by the Compliance Department and a member of Senior Management. 
 No Supervised Person of the Firm or his her Related Persons may engage in any Political Activity for any federal, state, county, or local political campaign, candidate or officeholder, or any political organizations (e.g., political party committee, political action committee), without the prior written approval of a Compliance Officer. Such requests should be submitted via the Firm s compliance portal. Political Activity for the purpose of this Policy is defined as monetary or in-kind campaign contributions to, or for the benefit of, any government official, candidate running for office, political party or legislative leadership, politically active non-profit, ballot measure committee or PAC as well as the solicitation and coordination of campaign contributions. Volunteering for a campaign that does not include solicitation or coordination of campaign contributions does not require pre- approval. 
 A Supervised Person and their Related Persons wishing to engage in a Political Activity must submit a Political Activity pre-clearance request on behalf of the Supervised Person (or his or her Related Person) through the Firm s compliance portal prior to engaging in Political Activity, and such submission must include all pertinent information related to the proposed activity, including, but not limited to, the individual wishing to contribute, amount of the contribution, the name of the intended recipient, the nature of the recipient s candidacy, whether the proposed recipient holds an existing political office (whether local, state or federal), and whether the Supervised Person (or his or her Related Person, where applicable) is legally entitled to vote for the proposed recipient. Because of the serious nature of the sanctions applicable to a pay to play violation, requests to engage in Political Activity for candidates seeking election to state and local offices will generally be limited, depending on whether a Supervised Person is legally entitled to vote for the candidate. As such, requests to donate to state or local candidates and officials may be approved up to 350, where the Supervised Person is legally entitled to vote for the candidate, and is limited to 150 or less, where a Supervised Person is not legally entitled to vote for the candidate or where the relevant jurisdiction imposes more restrictive limits. Once approved, Supervised Persons and or their Related Persons (as applicable) must make the contribution within 60 days of the approval date, unless otherwise noted by Compliance. If the Political Activity is not completed within this time frame, a new preclearance request must be submitted. In addition, if the proposed Political Activity is a monetary contribution, Supervised Persons are responsible for ensuring that the contribution is made solely towards the political campaign or candidate for which it is approved.

The Firm expects that every Supervised Person will explain the importance of compliance with this policy to his her Related Persons, and ensure their clear understanding of the obligation to follow these requirements. Moreover, the applicable laws in this area are complex and a trap for the unwary - no Supervised Person should attempt to decide for himself or herself whether a Political Activity is prohibited or permissible. Supervised Persons are responsible for complying with and tracking their own Political Activity limits. 
 2. Indirect Violations 
 The pay to play laws also prohibit actions taken indirectly that the Firm or its Supervised Persons could not take directly without violating the law. For example, it is improper and unlawful to provide funds to a third party (such as a consultant or attorney) with the understanding that the third party will use such funds to make an otherwise prohibited contribution. Such indirect violations may trigger disqualification of the Firm from receiving compensation and result in other sanctions, including possible criminal penalties. If any Supervised Person learns of facts and circumstances suggesting a possible indirect violation, that Supervised Person must report such facts and circumstances to a Compliance Officer immediately. 
 3. Periodic Disclosure 
 In order to ensure compliance with this policy, every Supervised Person must submit via the Firm s compliance portal, a disclosure and certification setting forth all Political Activity by the Supervised Person and his her Related Persons for the previous two (2) years or confirming that no such contributions have been made, prior to and at commencement of employment and or first becoming a Supervised Person. Supervised Persons are also required to disclose and certify all Political Activity in which they or their Related Persons have engaged on a quarterly basis.

V. OUTSIDE AFFILIATIONS POLICY 
 A. OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES 
 From time to time, Supervised Persons may be asked and or desire to own, work for or serve as a general partner, managing member, principal, proprietor, consultant, agent, representative, or employees of an outside organization for or without compensation, all of which are considered Outside Business Activities . These organizations may include, but are not limited to, public or private corporations, limited and general partnerships, family offices, endowments, and foundations. 
 In addition, Outside Business Activities may include a Supervised Person s personal publications regarding credit investments or a Supervised Person s personal use of social media for actual or intended monetary benefit. Examples of such publications or social media include, but are not limited to, printed articles, weblogs, video logs, You Tube, X, Instagram and TikTok. 
 Outside Business Activities may, however, create potential conflicts of interest and or provide access to MNPI. In order for the Compliance Department to address these potential issues, Supervised Persons must obtain prior approval from their supervisor and a Compliance Officer to engage in Outside Business Activities . Approval should be requested through the Firm s compliance portal. 
 Prior approval is generally not required to assume positions with charitable and other non- profit organizations or civic and trade associations. However, if your responsibilities will include the provision of investment advice, such as participation on the investment committee of a non-profit organization, or the organization is a client or business partner of the Firm or its Affiliates, you must obtain prior approval from your supervisor and a Compliance Officer. 
 B. DIRECTOR AND OFFICER POSITIONS 
 In other instances, Supervised Persons may be asked or desire to serve as a director, trustee or officer, with or without compensation, for organizations unaffiliated with the Firm and its Affiliates Outside Director and Officer Positions ). Separately, Supervised Persons may be asked to serve as a director or officer, with or without compensation, for organizations that are affiliated with the Firm, or its Affiliates Affiliated Director and Officer Positions ). 
 As a prospective board member, trustee or officer, it is critical that you coordinate with the Compliance Department to ensure that potential conflicts of interest are addressed and special measures are taken to handle and maintain the confidentiality of any information that you may obtain in your new position. 
 1. Outside Director and Officer Positions 
 As such, in the event that you wish to assume an Outside Director and Officer Position, you must obtain prior approval from your supervisor and a Compliance Officer . Outside Director and Officer Positions will be approved only if any associated conflicts of interest and risks, 

 39 
 
 Page -39- 
 OFS Capital Management Confidential. Do not copy or distribute. 

actual or apparent, can be satisfactorily mitigated or resolved. Please note, however, you are not required to seek pre-approval or provide disclosure to serve as a board member or officer of a personal residential organization, such as a homeowner s association or coop board, or an entity formed for personal estate planning purposes. 
 2. Affiliated Positions 
 If you are assuming an Affiliated Director and Officer Position, you must only disclose your new position to the Compliance Department and in a timely manner . However, you are not required to pre-clear or disclose director or officer positions with holding companies, or pass- through entities affiliated with OFS, the OFS Funds or the OFS Funds underlying assets. 
 Disclosures of Affiliated Director and Officer Positions should be made through the Firms compliance portal. 
 C. EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIPS 
 The Firm needs to be aware of relationships maintained by Supervised Persons with third parties that may create the potential for conflicts of interest. The Firm uses this information to assess the need to prohibit certain Supervised Persons from handling matters where such a conflict exists or institute mitigating controls surrounding the levels of business activity or contract negotiations where a relationship posing a conflict has been identified. This may include situations where a Supervised Person s Related Person or Family Member is 1) a director, an owner of more than 5 of or a senior management executive of a public company, 2) employed or engaged by a company with which the Firm is conducting or may conduct business, and such Related Person or Family Member is in a position to make decisions with respect to such business or is directly involved with the relationship with the Firm (e.g. a law firm, real estate broker or general contractor), or 3) employed with or serving in an office of a state or local government entity (e.g., city retirement system, state office, public university), in which the Related Person or Family Member has the authority, directly or indirectly, to affect the entity s current or prospective relationship with the Firm. Such relationships should be disclosed using the Firm s compliance portal. 
 For purposes of this Code, Family Member means the parents, children, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and in-laws of the Supervised Person regardless of residence, financial dependence, or investment control.

VI. ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY 
 The purpose of the OFS Adviser s Anti-Corruption Policy is to ensure compliance by the Firm and its employees with applicable anti-bribery laws. As such, the Policy prohibits OFS Adviser employees from offering, promising, paying or providing, or authorizing the promising, paying or providing (in each case, directly or indirectly, including through third parties) of any amount of money or anything of value to any Public Official or Private Sector Counterparty (defined below), including a person actually known to be an immediate family member of such parties, in order to improperly influence or reward any action or decision by such person for the Firm s benefit. 
 Neither funds from the Firm nor funds from any other source may be used to make any such payment or gift on behalf of or for the Firm s benefit. 
 A. INTERACTION WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (also referred to as the FCPA is a U.S. federal law that generally prohibits the bribery of foreign officials (also referred to as Public Officials ), directly or indirectly, by any individual, business entity or employee of any such entity for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and or gaining an unfair advantage. 
 Public Official , for purposes of this Policy, includes any person who is employed full- or part-time by a government, or by regional subdivisions of governments, including states, provinces, districts, counties, cities, towns and villages or by independent agencies, state-owned businesses, state- controlled businesses or public academic institutions. This would include, for example, employees of sovereign wealth funds, government-sponsored pension plans (i.e. pension plans for the benefit of government employees), heads of state, lower level employees of state-controlled businesses and government-sponsored university endowments. Public Official also includes political party officials and candidates for political office. For example, a campaign contribution is the equivalent of a payment to a Public Official under the FCPA. In certain cases, providing a payment or thing of value to a person actually known to be an immediate family member of a Public Official or a charity associated with a Public Official may be the equivalent of providing a thing of value to the Public Official directly. 
 Under the FCPA, the employees of public international organizations, such as the African and Asian Development Banks, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the Organization of American States, are considered Public Officials. 
 In April 2010, the United Kingdom, passed its own anti-bribery law, the Bribery Act 2010 (the Bribery Act ). However, the law went further than the FCPA, prohibiting not only bribery of foreign public officials but also the bribery of private parties. Further, the Bribery Act, unlike the FCPA, prohibits passive bribery or the acceptance of bribes, in addition to active bribery, or giving a bribe. 

41

The OFS Adviser Anti-Corruption Policy is applicable to all OFS Adviser employees, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency. Although the FCPA and the Bribery Act are the principal anti-bribery statutes applicable to OFS Adviser and its employees worldwide, OFS Adviser and its employees are also subject to the applicable anti-bribery laws of all jurisdictions in which they do business and any jurisdictions involved in OFS Adviser s cross-border transactions. OFS Adviser employees who are not U.S. or U.K. citizens or residents may also be subject to anti-bribery laws of their countries of citizenship or residency, as applicable. 
 Prior to transacting business (including merger and acquisition transactions and the retention of certain third parties) outside the U.S. or U.K., you should consult with the CCO or Chief Legal Officer or local counsel to obtain the applicable policies, requirements and procedures pertinent to complying with the applicable anti-bribery laws of such jurisdictions. 
 B. INTERACTION WITH PRIVATE SECTOR COUNTERPARTY REPRESENTATIVES 
 OFS employees should be sensitive to anti-corruption issues in their dealings directly or indirectly, with Private Sector Counterparty Representatives. A Private Sector Counterparty Representative is an owner, employee, or representative of a private entity, such as a partnership or corporation, with which OFS Adviser is conducting or seeking to conduct business. Individuals affiliated with current and prospective clients, joint venture partners and service providers and other third parties in such a capacity are all Private Sector Counterparty Representatives . 
 Bribery concerns may arise in connection with your day-to-day interactions with Private Sector Counterparty Representatives, regarding, for example, the offering of investment opportunities or the solicitation of OFS Adviser business by service providers. It is important to be mindful of the anti- bribery laws and to avoid any action that may give the appearance of bribery in your dealings with such individuals. While you may engage in the exchange of gifts, meals and entertainment with Private Sector Counterparty Representatives in the normal and routine course of business, it is important that you adhere to this Policy and to the Gifts and Entertainment Policy of this Code to avoid running afoul of the anti-corruption laws. 
 C. RETENTION OF CERTAIN THIRD PARTIES 
 Payments by OFS Adviser to Third Parties raise special concerns under the FCPA, Bribery Act and any other applicable anti-bribery laws. A Third Party is defined as any consultant, investor, joint venture partner, local partner, broker, agent or other third party retained or to be retained by OFS Adviser for purposes of dealing with a Public Official or a Private Sector Counterparty Representative on behalf of OFS Adviser or where the contemplated services are likely to involve business-related interactions with a Public Official or Private Sector Counterparty Representative on behalf of OFS on

behalf of OFS Adviser or where the contemplated services are likely to involve business-related interactions with a Public Official or Private Sector Counterparty Representative on behalf of OFS Adviser. Because of the risk that a Third Party may seek to secure business for OFS Adviser or its Advisory Clients through violations of the FCPA or Bribery Act and that OFS Adviser or its Advisory Client s Portfolio Companies may be subject to liability under the FCPA or Bribery Act as a result, any agreement with a Third Party that is engaged to do business with OFS Adviser is subject to specific due diligence and contractual requirements to assure compliance with the Firm s Anti-Corruption Policy. 
 
 D. PRE-APPROVAL, REPORTING, DUE DILIGENCE AND CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS 
 Unless otherwise authorized by the CCO or a Compliance Officer, you are required to adhere to the following policies and procedures, designed to facilitate your compliance with applicable anti- bribery laws. 
 You must submit a preclearance request and obtain pre-approval for the following types of expenses and contributions 
 Gifts and entertainment, including food and beverages, travel, or lodging or anything of value provided to a Public Official or a person known to be an immediate family member or guest of a Public Official
