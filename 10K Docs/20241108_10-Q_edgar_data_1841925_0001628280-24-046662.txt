 For all acquisitions, trade receivables and payables, as well as other current and non-current assets and liabilities and deferred revenue, were valued at the existing carrying value as they represented the fair value of those items at the acquisition date, based on management s judgments and estimates. 
 Because the acquisition related to Kinetic occurred within the last twelve months, the Company s fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation are preliminary and may change during the allowable measurement period, which is up to the point the Company obtains and analyzes the information that existed as of the date of the acquisition necessary to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but in no case to exceed more than one year from the date of the acquisition. Changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for the business combination of Kinetic upon the finalization of more detailed analyses of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of the transaction will change the allocation of the purchase price. Subsequent changes to the purchase allocation during the measurement period that are material will be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. As of November 8, 2024, the

The purchase price is subject to working capital and other adjustments as provided in the Share Sale and Purchase Agreement. 
 The Company paid a premium (i.e., goodwill) over the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired as this acquisition immediately expands the Company s ADAS and User Experience product and technology offering to its global tier one and automotive OEM customer base. Specifically, indie can now leverage Exalos technology portfolio to extend its FMCW LiDAR portfolio. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
 The Company incurred various acquisition-related costs, which were primarily legal expenses and recorded as part of the S elling, General and Administrative expenses. Total costs incurred were during the year ended December 31, 2023. Total costs incurred are for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company maintained an adjustment holdback for the purpose of providing security against any adjustment to the amounts at closing. The holdback period extended for months from the closing date and was paid in shares of Class A common stock. On September 27, 2024, the adjustment holdback was settled and shares of Class A common stock were issued with a final fair value of . Accordingly, the fair value of the adjustment holdback liability was reduced to as of September 30, 2024 and a loss of was recorded in Other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Total purchase consideration transferred at closing also included contingent consideration that had a fair value of as of the acquisition date. The acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the Company s assessment of the probability of achieving the performance targets that ultimately obligate the Company to transfer additional consideration to the seller though the Monte Carlo simulation. The contingent consideration is comprised of two tranches, with maximum payout up to and , respectively, both subject to Exalos achieving certain revenue targets. Both tranches are payable in cash or Class A common stock, at indie s election, up to a maximum of , upon the achievement of a revenue threshold of for the period ending on September 30, 2024 and the achievement of a revenue threshold of for the period ending on September 30, 2025, respectively. The fair value of any outstanding contingent consideration liabilities will be remeasured as of the end of each reporting period with any resulting remeasurement gains or losses recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The first and second tranche of this earn-out liability are both reflected in Contingent considerations in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. On November 7, 2024, the first tranche of contingent consideration was settled through the issuance of shares of Class A common stock and cash payment of .

 Change in the contingent considerations was driven by updating the valuation methodology from probability-weighted method to Monte Carlo Simulations analysis. The Company initially used the probability-weighted method to determine the fair value of the equity-based earn out as certain information was not available to conduct the Monte Carlo Simulations analysis. 
 Changes in fair value of inventory, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets step-up and deferred tax liabilities were a result of gathering additional information during the measurement period. The Company also revised the initial values of intangible assets as a result of switching from utilizing publicly available benchmarking information to determine the fair value of the intangible assets to primarily utilizing an income method based on forecasts of expected future cash flows. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment to increase the amortization of intangible assets of in the condensed consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that would have been recorded during year ended December 31, 2023 if the adjustment to the intangible assets had been recognized as of the date of the acquisition. 
 Developed technology relates to near-infrared super-luminescent diodes SLEDs ), which can be used in Fiber-Optic Gyroscopes FOG for aerospace and defense navigation systems and sensors for fiber-optic sensing applications. Exalos existing SLEDs technology is complementary to TeraXion s fiber-optic technology and immediately expands indie s ADAS and user experience product and technology. Developed technologies was valued using relief from royalty of the income approach. The selected royalty rate was determined based on an analysis of licensing agreements related to similar technologies and was further adjusted to reflect the maintenance R D expenses associated with sustaining the technology. The economic useful life was determined to be based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period. 
 Customer relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of products to existing customers of Exalos. The fair value was determined by applying the excess earnings method of the income approach. The economic useful life was determined to be . 
 Backlog relates to various purchase orders in place with Exalos customers at the time of the acquisition. The fair value was determined by applying the excess earnings method of the income approach. The economic useful life was determined to be .

The selected royalty rate was determined based on an analysis of licensing agreements related to similar technologies and was further adjusted to reflect the maintenance R D expenses associated with sustaining the technology. 
 Under both the relief from royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods, the fair value models incorporated estimates of future cash flows, estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows, estimates of future growth rates and management s

 Contract Balances 
 Certain assets or liabilities are recorded depending on the timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections on a contract-by-contract basis. Contract liabilities primarily relate to deferred revenue, including advance consideration received from customers for contracts prior to the transfer of control to the customer, and therefore revenue is recognized upon delivery of products and services or as the services are performed. 
 Contract liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities

Deferred revenue fluctuates over time due to changes in the timing of payments received from customers and revenue recognized for services provided. 
 Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted development arrangements that has not been recognized, which includes deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of performance obligations that have not been recognized as revenue was , of which approximately is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next months.

On November 30, 2023, the Company responded to the demand letter, denying that any breach occurred or that the party is entitled to any damages. There have been no further developments on this matter. The Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a potential loss, if any, on this matter. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against the claims made in the demand letter. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing matter, from time to time, the Company may be a party to routine claims or litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business. These may include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of these matters and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company continues to reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates.

 Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Current and continued inflationary conditions have led to, and may continue to lead to, rising prices or rising interest rates, which has had a dampening effect on overall economic activity and consumer demand for automotive products. Additionally, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the implications of these events has created global political and economic uncertainty. We are closely monitoring developments, including potential impact to our business, customers, suppliers, our employees and operations in Israel, the Middle East and elsewhere. At this time, the impact to indie is subject to change given the volatile nature of the situation.

 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 54.0 million, compared to 60.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 6.5 million, which was primarily driven by a 2.1 million decrease in product revenue and a 4.4 million decrease in contract revenue. The decrease in product revenue was due primarily to change in product volume (units sold) as a result of the cyclical trough in the automotive market. The decrease in contract revenue of 4.4 million was primarily due to a large multi-year non-recurring engineering project that commenced in early 2022 that is winding down in the current year towards its completion stage.

 Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 32.7 million, compared to 35.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 2.5 million or 7 was primarily due to a 1.5 million decrease in product shipments in connection with the decline in products sold as described above and a 1.5 million decrease in product cost. Total cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 also included an additional 0.9 million in amortization related to acquired intangible assets and amortization for inventory step-up value both as a result of the business combinations that took place during the period. 
 Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 46.0 million, compared to 41.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 4.4 million or 11 was primarily due to a 3.7 million increase in share-based compensation expense and 0.8 million increase in personnel cost. Increases in share-based compensation expense were primarily driven by new equity awards granted since the same period in prior year. We expect research and development expense to stabilize over time. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.8 million, compared to 19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.0 million or 5 was primarily due to a 0.8 million increase in share-based compensation expense due to an increase in employee headcount and additional equity awards granted since the same period prior year. We expect selling, general, and administrative expense to stabilize over time.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains (losses) from change in fair value for warrants, contingent considerations and acquisition-related holdbacks. The gains (losses) recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 represent the following: 
 
 i) Warrants: During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain from change in fair value of our warrants of 15.7 million, which reflected the decrease in fair value of our warrant liability, resulting from the decrease of the closing price of our Class A common stock listed on the Nasdaq to 6.30 per share on September 30, 2023 from 9.40 per share on June 30, 2023. As of November 9, 2023, we completed our exchange of Warrants. Subsequently there will be no future remeasurement. 
 ii) Contingent considerations and acquisition-related holdbacks: During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net loss from change in fair value of our contingent considerations and acquisition-related holdbacks of 4.5 million. The net loss is primarily attributed to a net unrealized loss of 7.4 million for the contingent considerations related to the Exalos acquisition, offset by an net unrealized gain of 3.1 million for the contingent considerations and acquisition-related holdbacks related to the GEO acquisition. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a net unrealized gain from change in fair value of our contingent considerations and acquisition-related holdbacks of 3.5 million which is primarily contributed by an unrealized gain of 2.9 million and 0.8 million for the contingent considerations and acquisition-related holdbacks related to the GEO and Symeo acquisitions, respectively. 
 Other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.7 million and (0.7) million, respectively. Other income (expense) relates primarily to the realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses during the period, which was primarily driven by a net gain (loss) of 0.5 million and (0.8) million related to the change in fair value of our currency forward contracts entered during the periods.

 Refer to Note 17, Income Tax , in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional detail. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, working capital requirements related to inventory, accounts payable and general and administrative expenditures. In addition, from time to time, we use cash to fund our mergers and acquisitions, purchases of various capital, intellectual property and software assets and scheduled repayments for outstanding debt obligations. Our immediate sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents and funds anticipated to be generated from our operations, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of Class A common stock under the ATM Agreement. We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, the timing and extent of spending on various business initiatives, including potential merger and acquisition activities, our international expansion, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our solutions, and overall economic conditions including the potential impact of global supply imbalances, rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, the impact of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and volatility in the global financial markets. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. We have cash deposits with large financial institutions that have stable outlooks and credit ratings as of November 8, 2024. These cash deposits may exceed the insurance provided on such deposits. As part of our cash management strategy going forward, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions that are subject to regulation and maintain deposits across diverse retail banks. 
 Historically, we derive liquidity primarily from debt and equity financing activities as we have historically had negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, our balance of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was 107.2 million.

The outstanding principal balance is due and payable in full on March 28, 2025. Interest is payable monthly beginning on May 1, 2024 through the maturity date. This line of credit required us to collateralize a cash balance equal to the total outstanding balance in a cash security account with Wells Fargo. 
 On September 27, 2024, Wuxi entered into a short-term loan agreement with the Bank of Ningbo Co., Ltd. with an aggregate principal balance of CNY40,000 (or approximately 5,705) bearing interest of 3.50 per annum and maturing on December 27, 2024. 
 Acquisitions 
 
 We have completed multiple acquisitions in the last couple of years and we plan to selectively pursue and assess inorganic growth opportunities that are complementary to our existing technologies and portfolio of products and/or accelerate our growth initiatives. 
 
 In connection with our acquisitions (See Part I, Item 1, Note 2, Business Combinations, of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q), we may from time to time be required to make future payments or issue additional shares of our common stock to satisfy our obligations under the acquisition agreements, including to satisfy certain earn-out requirements. In January 2022, we completed the acquisition of Symeo, for which we made an initial cash payment of approximately 10.0 million and an additional 10.0 million was paid in January 2023. We are still subject to an equity based earn out of Class A common stock based on Symeo s future revenue growth. 
 In February 2023, we entered into an agreement to acquire GEO, and completed the transaction on March 3, 2023. The closing consideration consisted of (i) 93.4 million in cash (including accrued cash considerations at closing and net of cash acquired); (ii) the issuance by indie of 6,868,768 shares of Class A common stock at closing, with a fair value of 75.6 million; (iii) 1,907,180 shares of Class A common stock, with a fair value of 21.0 million at closing, payable in the next 24-month period after closing; and (iv) an earn-out with a fair value of 59.3 million at closing payable in cash or in Class A common stock, subject to achieving certain GEO-related revenue targets through September 30, 2024. 
 Additionally, in February 2023, we acquired Silicon Radar, for approximately (i) 9.2 million in cash (including debt payable at closing and net of cash acquired), (ii) the issuance by indie of 982,445 shares of Class A common stock at closing, with a fair value of 9.8 million; and (iii) a contingent consideration with fair value of 9.2 million at closing, payable in cash or in Class A common stock subject to Silicon Radar s achievement of certain revenue-based and design-win milestones through February 21, 2025. 
 In September 2023, we acquired Exalos. The closing consideration consisted of (i) the issuance by indie of 6,613,786 shares of Class A common stock at closing, with a fair value of 42.8 million; (ii) a contingent consideration with fair value of 9.8 million at closing, payable in cash, subject to Exalos achievement of certain revenue-based milestones through September 30, 2025; and (iii) a holdback of 2.5 million subject to final release 12 months from the acquisition date payable in shares of Class A common stock. 
 On January 25, 2024, we completed the acquisition of certain business properties from Kinetic through an asset purchase agreement. The closing consideration consisted of (i) 3.2 million in cash as the initial cash consideration, net of an adjustment holdback amount of 0.5 million and an indemnity holdback amount of 0.8 million, (ii) 2.3 million of contingent considerations, payable in cash or Class A common stock, subject to achievement of certain production based milestone for the next 24 months, or through January 25, 2026, and (iii) 2.3 million of contingent considerations, payable in cash or Class A common stock, subject to achievement of certain revenue based milestones 12 months after January 25, 2024. The indemnity holdback amount is payable within five business days after the 18-month anniversary of the closing date of January 25, 2024. 
 We expect to continue to incur net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. We also expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures will increase over time as we continue to expand our operations, product offerings and customer base.

 The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Change 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (51,877) (87,977) 36,100 (41) Net cash used in investing activities (16,726) (103,569) 86,843 (84) Net cash provided by financing activities 23,454 34,195 (10,741) (31) 
 Operating Activities 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, working capital requirements related to inventory, accounts payable and general and administrative expenditures. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 51.9 million, which included net loss of 109.8 million and reflected adjustments for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash decreases primarily consisted of 27.5 million of net losses resulting from a change in fair value for contingent considerations and currency forward contracts, and non-cash increased consisted of 55.4 million in share-based compensation expense and 30.9 million in depreciation and amortization. Changes in operating assets and liabilities from operations used 8.8 million of cash, primarily driven by an increase in inventory and a decrease in accrued expenses, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable. 
 Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 88.0 million, which included net loss of 114.2 million and reflected adjustments for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash increases primarily consisted of 2.7 million of net losses resulting from a change in fair value for warrants and contingent considerations, 36.6 million in share-based compensation expense and 26.5 million in depreciation and amortization. Changes in operating assets and liabilities from operations used 39.3 million of cash, primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid and other current assets. 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 16.7 million and 103.6 million, respectively. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in cash was primarily due to the acquisition of Kinetic for 3.2 million, net of cash acquired, as well as an increase in cash used of 12.5 million for the purchase of capital expenditures. During the period ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in cash was primarily due to the acquisitions of Exalos, GEO and Silicon Radar for 95.0 million, net of cash acquired, as well as an increase in cash used of 8.6 million for the purchase of capital expenditures. We expect that we will make additional capital expenditures in the future, including licenses to various intangible assets, in order to support the future growth of our business. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.5 million, which was primarily attributed to 10.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the line of credit through Wells Fargo, 13.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stocks through the ATM and 5.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of a line of credit through the Bank of Ningbo Co., LTD, partially offset by 2.0 million payments on debt obligations and 4.4 million of payments on financed software. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 34.2 million, which was primarily attributed to 52.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stocks through the ATM, partially offset by 12.5 million payments on debt obligations, and 7.0 million of payments on financed software. 
 
 Future Material Cash Obligations 
 
 Following is a summary of our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, including commitments for capital expenditures, as of September 30, 2024:

 In connection with our acquisitions (See subheading titled Liquidity and Capital Resources Acquisitions above, we may be required to make future payments or issue additional shares of our common stock to satisfy certain earn-out requirements under the acquisition agreements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on a registrant s financial condition or results of operations. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenue; business combinations, which impacts the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities; and contingent considerations, which impact the fair value of assumed liabilities and the recording of other income (expense). We have other significant accounting policies that do not generally require subjective estimates or judgments or would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are disclosed under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards 
 
 We describe the recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements that apply to us in Note 1 Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation to our condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We have international operations, giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures are the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan/renminbi, Euro, British pound sterling and Israeli New Shekel. Foreign exchange gains and losses that resulted from our international operations are included in the determination of Net income (loss) . The foreign currency translation exchange gain (loss) included in determining loss before income taxes was 0.7 million and (0.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 the foreign currency translation exchange gain included in determining loss before income taxes was 0.7 million and 0.3 million, respectively. The year-over-year change was primarily related to the change in fair value of our currency forward contracts entered into during 2024. We also have intercompany loans with certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are long-term in nature. Repayments of such principal amounts are neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future and are therefore treated analogous to equity for accounting purposes. As a result, the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of Net income (loss) and recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. A cumulative foreign currency translation loss of 8.5 million and 20.3 million related to our foreign subsidiaries is included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Stockholders' Equity section of the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by the cumulative foreign currency translation loss recorded in relation to permanently invested intercompany loans as of September 30, 2024 as the exchange rate for U.S. dollar fluctuates against foreign currencies. 

42 

Table of Contents 

 As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in foreign currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. dollar could increase the costs of our international expansion and operation. To mitigate the risk, we plan to enter into additional foreign currency forward contracts in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Investment and Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our exposure to interest rate and general market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio, which consists of cash and cash equivalents (money market funds and marketable securities purchased with less than ninety days until maturity) and restricted cash that totals approximately 107.2 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The main objectives of our investment activities are liquidity and preservation of capital. Our cash equivalent investments have short-term maturity periods that dampen the impact of market or interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with our investments is not material because our investments are diversified across securities with high credit ratings. 
 
 Given the objectives of our investment activities, and the relatively low interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents, and other investments, we do not believe that investment or interest rate risks currently pose material exposures to our business or results of operations even in the current environment of rising interest rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024 and based on this evaluation, have concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Per Rule 13a-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance, and not absolute assurance, that the desired control objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals in all future circumstances. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures must be designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. 
 
 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 As disclosed in in Part II Item 9A of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with SEC on February 29, 2024, management determined that the Company did not have effective risk assessment to identify and analyze risks related to non-routine transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions, at a sufficient level of detail to identify all relevant risks of material misstatement across the Company or within each acquired entity . Additionally, the Company did not have effective information control processes, including those related to information technology general controls ITGCs ), user access controls and the use of manual spreadsheets, to ensure the reliability of information used in certain computations related to financial reporting. As a consequence of the aforementioned deficiencies, the Company did not have effective control activities related to the design and operation of process-level controls across certain key financial reporting processes. 
 
 Management has determined that these material weaknesses persisted as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 43 

Table of Contents 

Remediation Efforts to Address the Material Weaknesses 
 
 Management s remediation efforts are ongoing and the actions outlined in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, will continue to be pursued. As we continue to evaluate and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional measures to address the material weaknesses or adjustments to the remediation plan may be required. However, we cannot guarantee when we will remediate material weaknesses, nor can we be certain that additional steps will be necessary. Furthermore, it cannot be guaranteed that no further material weaknesses will emerge in the future. 
 
 The remediation efforts are subject to continuous management evaluation and audit committee supervision. Until Management has completed its remediation efforts and evaluated their effectiveness, we will not be able to determine whether the steps taken will completely remedy the material deficiencies in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15d during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, with the exception of the ongoing remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses described above.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. In addition, regardless of the outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us, which may be material because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The business, financial condition, and operating results of the Company can be affected by many factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part 1, Item 1A in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Risk Factors , any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or the anticipated future financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price. There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in Part 1, Item 1A in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed on February 29, 2024.

The shares of Class A common stock were issued to the two ADK Minority Holders in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).
