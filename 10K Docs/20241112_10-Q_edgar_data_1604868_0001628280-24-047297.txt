 Lease expense is recorded within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations based upon the nature of the operating lease right-of-use assets. Where assets are used to directly serve our customers, such as retail locations and distribution centers, lease costs are recorded in Store operations and other operational expenses. Facilities and assets which serve management and support functions are expensed through Selling, general, and administrative. 
 
 The Company's subleases generally do not relieve it of its primary obligations under the corresponding head lease. As a result, the Company accounts for the head lease based on the original assessment at inception. Additionally, the Company determines if the sublease arrangement is either a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease at inception. The Company's subleases are all operating leases related to the sublease of a closed retail location. The Company recognizes sublease income within Store operations and other operational expenses. 
 
 If the total remaining lease cost on the head lease for the term of the sublease is greater than the anticipated sublease income, the right-of-use asset is assessed for impairment. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. In conjunction with the Company's restructuring activities as discussed in Note 16, Restructuring , the Company assessed and impaired the right-of-use assets of certain closed retail locations, which resulted in an impairment loss of million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 16, Restructuring , for additional information on the restructuring activities.

OVERVIEW 
 
 GrowGeneration Corp. (together with all of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively "GrowGeneration" or the "Company") was incorporated in Colorado in 2014. Since then, GrowGeneration has grown from a small chain of specialty retail hydroponic and organic garden centers to a multifaceted business with diverse assets. Today, GrowGeneration operates two major lines of business: its Cultivation and Gardening segment, composed of the Company's hydroponic and organic gardening business; and its Storage Solutions segment, composed of the Company's benching, racking, and storage solutions business. 
 
 MARKETS AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we realigned our operating and reportable segments to correspond with changes to our operating model, management structure, and internal reporting and to better align with how the chief operating decision maker makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and assesses performance. Accordingly, we identified two operating segments, each its own reportable segment, based on our major lines of business: the Cultivation and Gardening segment and the Storage Solutions segment. Comparative prior period disclosures have been recast to conform to the current segment presentation. 
 
 We recognize specifically identifiable operating costs such as cost of sales, distribution expenses, and store operations and other operational expenses within each segment. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, such as administrative and management expenses, salaries, and benefits, share based compensation, director fees, legal expenses, accounting and consulting expenses, and technology costs, are not allocated to specific segments and are reflected in the enterprise results. 
 
 Cultivation and Gardening Segment 
 
 We are a leading developer, marketer, retailer, and distributor of products for both indoor and outdoor hydroponic and organic gardening. Our main business strategy within the hydroponic and organic gardening sector has been to consolidate assets within the fragmented hydroponics industry to leverage efficiencies of a centralized organization. 
 
 We sell a variety of hydroponic and organic gardening related products, including nutrients, additives, growing media, lighting, environmental control systems, and other products for indoor and outdoor cultivation. Our products include proprietary brands such as Charcoir, Drip Hydro, Power Si, Ion lights, The Harvest Company, and more, the development and expansion of which are a key component of the Company's growth strategy. Our target customers include commercial and craft growers, as well as home growers, in the plant-based medicine market, and commercial and home gardeners who grow organic herbs, fruits, and vegetables. Additionally, through our brand HRG Distribution, we distribute many of our products, including our proprietary 
 19 

products, to customers that are wholesalers, resellers, and retailers in the specialty retail hydroponic and organic gardening industry. 
 
 We make our products available to growers through a variety of channels, including hydroponic retail locations, a commercial sales teams serving commercial cultivators, an online platform for cultivators at growgeneration.com, and a wholesale business, HRG Distribution, that markets to resellers in both the hydroponic and traditional gardening markets. Management believes that the Company has the largest chain of specialty retail hydroponic and organic garden centers in the U.S., with 31 retail locations across 12 states as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Storage Solutions Segment 
 
 Our Storage Solutions business, branded as "Mobile Media" or "MMI," provides customized storage solutions designed to enhance profitability, productivity, and efficiency for our customers by allowing them to save space and increase storage capacity. We cater to diverse markets with our products and services, including agriculture, retail, warehousing, office and administrative, food service, hospitality, golf and country clubs, and more. Our products include high-density mobile storage systems, static shelving, and other accessories such as desks, lockers, safes, and secured storage, offering a solution for every storage need. MMI also offers a wide variety of services, including site surveys, floor plan designs, capacity analysis, seismic calculations, permitting, and installation, in order to provide a comprehensive, turnkey solution for customers. Based in the Hudson Valley, New York, the MMI team has decades of experience successfully completing projects throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. 
 
 Our target customers generally include small, mid-size, and large businesses seeking vertical space-saving solutions that are custom tailored to their space and brand in an effort to maximize storage capacity or gain space in their real estate footprint. Many of our customers are involved in the construction and design industries and include retailers, general contractors, and architects involved in new constructions and remodels for retail stores and fulfillment centers. Our customer base also includes the golf industry, specifically country clubs needing to store more club bags and optimize their existing space, as well as controlled environment agriculture (CEA) operators that cultivate indoors with vertical or rolling benching and racking. 
 
 Strategic Restructuring Plan 
 
 In July 2024, we announced a strategic restructuring plan focused on long-term profitability and advancing growth initiatives in key areas of our Gardening and Cultivation segment such as our proprietary brands, commercial sales, and e-commerce business. These restructuring plans have primarily included product development costs, digital transformation initiatives, reductions in cost structure by closing and consolidating 12 redundant or underperforming retail locations, in addition to the 7 retail locations closed in the first half of 2024, workforce reductions, and other operational improvements in inventory management, sales and marketing, and administrative activities. 
 
 Our restructuring and restructuring related charges consists of inventory disposal costs, retail location closure costs including related contract termination costs and fixed asset disposals, employee termination benefits, asset impairments including the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets, and other associated costs. 
 
 20 

Since the restructuring activities were announced in July 2024, we have incurred aggregate restructuring and restructuring-related costs of 2.1 million, presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as follows: 
 
 Restructuring Cultivation and Gardening segment: Cost of sales (1) 
 1,039 Gross profit (1,039) Store operations and other operational expenses (2) 
 658 Segment operating loss (1,697) Corporate expenses: Selling, general, and administrative (3) 
 88 Impairment loss (4) 
 220 Other expense (5) 
 50 Total restructuring and restructuring related charges (2,055) (1) Includes inventory disposal costs 
 (2) Costs consist of retail location closure costs including related contract termination costs and employee termination benefits 
 (3) Includes employee termination benefits and other associated costs 
 (4) Consists of asset impairments for operating lease right-of-use assets 
 (5) Includes non-operating losses related to retail location closures 

In addition to the effect on cost of sales shown above related to inventory disposal costs, we estimate we incurred a 0.9 million loss in gross profit due to inventory discounts offered in conjunction with exiting the twelve retail locations. Also in conjunction with our restructuring activities to support operational and administrative improvements, we reassessed and shortened the estimated useful life of certain capitalized software assets, which resulted in an 1.5 million increase to depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding restructuring liability was 0.3 million pertaining to employee termination benefits and contract terminations costs related to retail location closures, which we expect to pay before the end of the first quarter of 2025. However, certain facilities costs related to closed retail locations for which we are pursuing sublease arrangements will be paid over the remaining terms which extend through 2032 at the latest. 
 
 Overall, we expect to incur a total of approximately 2.4 million in restructuring and restructuring-related costs, including the 2.1 million previously incurred. The remainder of the expected charges primarily relate to corporate operational and administrative contract terminations and other associated costs. We expect that these restructuring activities will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025 and will improve gross profit margin and profitability while generating annualized cost savings of approximately 12.0 million. 
 
 Refer to Note 16, Restructuring, of our Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information regarding restructuring activities. 
 
 Growth Strategy 
 
 GrowGeneration's main growth strategy has been to consolidate assets within the fragmented hydroponics industry to leverage efficiencies of a centralized organization. As a result, we have built a business that is driven by a wide selection of products, a strong portfolio of proprietary brands, a solutions-driven staff located in strategic markets around the country, and pick, pack, ship distribution and fulfillment capabilities. 
 
 Since our founding in 2014, GrowGeneration has acquired or opened numerous specialty hydroponic and organic gardening center locations. Management believes that GrowGeneration has the largest chain of specialty retail hydroponic and organic garden centers in the U.S., with 31 retail locations across 12 states as of September 30, 2024. GrowGeneration has also acquired several other types of businesses within or complimentary to the hydroponic industry, such as online retailers, proprietary products, our distribution business, HRG, and our benching, racking, and storage solutions business, MMI. GrowGeneration 
 21 

regularly seeks and evaluates accretive acquisition opportunities with similar or complimentary businesses to those businesses it already operates. 
 
 Our main growth strategies for the Storage Solutions segment include expanding the types of customers and industries to which we sell our Storage Solutions products, including greater penetration in agriculture and golf and country clubs. In March 2024, we announced we had engaged Lake Street Capital to advise and assist in exploring strategic opportunities for our benching, racking, and storage solutions business. 

COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 We primarily generate net sales from the selling and distribution of proprietary and non-proprietary brand hydroponic and organic gardening products. In addition to our hydroponic and organic gardening product sales, we sell and install commercial fixtures through our benching, racking, and storage solutions business. Net sales reflect the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, which is derived from a list price reduced by variable consideration, including applicable sales discounts and estimated expected sales returns. 
 
 These sales vary by the type of product: consumables, such as nutrients, additives, growing media, and supplies that are subject to regular replenishment; and durables, such as lighting, environmental control systems, and storage solutions. Generally, in new markets where legalization of plant-based medicines is recent and licensors are starting new grow operations, there is an initial increase of durable product purchases for facility build-outs, which decrease over time as growers establish their operations. Thereafter, we tend to observe cultivators focus their purchasing patterns to consumables as the primary source of product need. In more mature markets, the sales patterns tend to favor higher percentages of consumable purchasing in comparison to emerging markets. 
 
 We assess the organic growth of our Cultivation and Gardening segment net sales on a same-store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same-store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial results and provides relevant information to assess our performance. New and acquired stores become eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base if the store has been under our ownership for the entire period in the same-store base periods for which we are including the store. Closed stores become ineligible for inclusion in the comparable store base in the month in which operations cease. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales includes cost of goods and shipping costs. Cost of goods consists of cost of merchandise, inbound freight, and other inventory-related costs, such as shrinkage costs and lower of cost or market adjustments. Occupancy expenses of our retail locations and distribution centers, which consist of payroll, rent, and other lease required costs, including common area maintenance and utilities, are included as a component of operating expenses within Store operations and other operational expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 We calculate gross profit as net sales less cost of sales. Gross profit excludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately as a component of operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, varies with our product mix, in particular the percentage of sales of proprietary brand products compared to non-proprietary brand products and of consumable products compared to durable products. Proprietary products typically have higher gross margins compared to non-proprietary products, and consumable products typically have higher gross margins compared to durable products. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses are comprised of the following components: store operations and other operational expenses; selling, general, and administrative; estimated credit losses; depreciation and amortization; and impairment losses. Store operations and other operational expenses consist primarily of payroll, rent and utilities, and allocated corporate overhead costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of corporate salaries, stock-based compensation, advertising and promotions, travel and entertainment, professional fees, insurance, and other corporate administrative costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales typically does not increase commensurate with an increase in net sales. Our largest expenses are generally related to employee compensation and leases, which are primarily fixed and not variable. Our advertising and marketing expenses are largely controllable and variable depending on the particular market.

R ESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Comparison of the Unaudited Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, selected information from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Year-to-Year Variance Net sales 50,006 100.0 55,678 100.0 (5,672) (10.2) Cost of sales 39,196 78.4 39,490 70.9 (294) (0.7) Gross profit 10,810 21.6 16,188 29.1 (5,378) (33.2) Operating expenses 22,901 45.8 24,218 43.5 (1,317) (5.4) Loss from operations (12,091) (24.2) (8,030) (14.4) (4,061) (50.6) Other income 613 1.2 681 1.2 (68) (10.0) Net loss before taxes (11,478) (23.0) (7,349) (13.2) (4,129) (56.2) Benefit for income taxes 43 0.1 43 Net loss (11,435) (22.9) (7,349) (13.2) (4,086) (55.6) Percentage is not meaningful. 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 50.0 million, a decrease of 5.7 million or 10.2 as compared to net sales of 55.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in net sales was primarily related to our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which had net sales of 41.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 48.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net sales was primarily due to the fiscal 2023 consolidation of 6 retail locations after September 30, 2023 as well as the closure of 19 retail locations to date in fiscal 2024, which include the 12 redundant or underperforming retail locations consolidated in conjunction with the restructuring plan. Additionally, we estimate that inventory sales discounts related to exiting the 12 restructuring retail locations contributed to reduced net sales of 0.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Same-store sales increased approximately 12.5 , primarily attributable to commercial sales growth, customer retention in markets where there were retail location closures and improvements in our e-commerce site sales volume. Proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 23.8 as compared to 19.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, largely driven by our strategic initiatives to increase sales volume with our expanded portfolio of proprietary brands and various proprietary product launches. The percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales related to consumable products remained relatively flat at 73.3 and 73.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Additionally, net sales of commercial fixtures within our Storage Solutions segment increased to 8.6 million, or 12.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased demand from retail customers. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 39.2 million, a decrease of 0.3 million or 0.7 compared to 39.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The corresponding reduction in cost of sales as compared to the 10.2 decrease in net sales, as previously discussed, was largely offset by the additional 1.0 million of inventory disposal costs incurred as part of the restructuring plan as well as reduced inventory discounts from vendors in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

23 

Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit was 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 5.4 million or 33.2 . The decrease in gross profit was primarily related to the Gardening and Cultivation segment, which decreased 5.5 million, or 43.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, largely as a result of the decrease in sales volume due to store consolidations and the effects of the strategic restructuring plan, including the estimated 0.9 million in inventory sales discounts and the additional 1.0 million of inventory disposal costs incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Gross profit from our Storage Solutions segment increased 0.1 million, or 2.7 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Gross profit margin was 21.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 750 basis points from a gross profit margin of 29.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely driven by the Gardening and Cultivation segment, which had a gross profit margin of 17.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 26.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the effects of the strategic restructuring plan, including the inventory disposal costs and inventory sales discounts, reduced inventory discounts from vendors, and continued industry pricing compression on distributed products. 
 
 Gross profit margin also decreased for the Storage Solutions segment to 42.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 46.4 in three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher costs of inventory. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses are comprised of store operations and other operational expenses, selling, general, and administrative, estimated credit losses, depreciation and amortization, and impairment loss. Operating expenses were 22.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 24.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.3 million or 5.4 . 
 
 Store operating costs and other operational expenses, which consisted primarily of payroll, rent and utilities, and allocated corporate overhead costs, were 10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.6 million or 13.9 . The decrease in store operating costs was primarily due to the fiscal 2023 consolidation of 6 retail locations after September 30, 2023 as well as the 19 retail locations closed to date in fiscal 2024, including the 12 redundant or underperforming retail locations consolidated in conjunction with the restructuring plan. This decrease was partially offset by the additional 0.7 million of restructuring costs incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to exiting those retail locations and the related employee termination benefits. 
 
 Total corporate overhead, which is comprised of selling, general, and administrative expense, estimated credit losses, and depreciation and amortization expense, remained stable at 12.6 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased by 0.2 million or 2.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of decreased professional fees and corporate expenses and decreased share-based compensation. This decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense was partially offset by a net 0.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which included increased depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment of approximately 0.8 million driven by the accelerated depreciation and amortization for certain capitalized software assets reassessed as part of our restructuring activities and decreased amortization expense of approximately 0.6 million related to intangible assets as a result of intangible asset impairments in fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 In conjunction with our strategic restructuring activities, we assessed the right-of-use assets of certain closed retail locations for impairment when we anticipated the total remaining lease cost for the term to be greater than the anticipated sublease income, which resulted in an impairment loss of 0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Other income (expense) remained relatively flat at approximately 0.6 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Comparison of the Unaudited Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Year-to-Year Variance Net sales 151,430 100.0 176,430 100.0 (25,000) (14.2) Cost of sales 113,835 75.2 126,816 71.9 (12,981) (10.2) Gross profit 37,595 24.8 49,614 28.1 (12,019) (24.2) Operating expenses 65,632 43.3 71,369 40.5 (5,737) (8.0) Loss from operations (28,037) (18.5) (21,755) (12.3) (6,282) (28.9) Other income 1,919 1.3 2,666 1.5 (747) (28.0) Net loss before taxes (26,118) (17.2) (19,089) (10.8) (7,029) (36.8) Benefit (provision) for income taxes (50) (93) (0.1) 43 (46.2) Net loss (26,168) (17.3) (19,182) (10.9) (6,986) (36.4) 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 151.4 million, a decrease of 25.0 million or 14.2 as compared to net sales of 176.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in net sales was primarily related to our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which had net sales of 130.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 152.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net sales was primarily due to the fiscal 2023 consolidation of 6 retail locations after September 30, 2023 as well as the closure of 19 retail locations to date in fiscal 2024, which include the 12 redundant or underperforming retail locations consolidated in conjunction with the restructuring plan. In addition to continued industry pricing compression on distributed products, we estimate that inventory sales discounts related to exiting the 12 restructuring retail locations contributed to reduced net sales of 0.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Same-store sales increased approximately 0.8 , primarily attributable to commercial sales growth and customer retention in markets where there were retail location closures. Proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.6 as compared to 18.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely driven by our strategic initiatives to increase sales volume with our expanded portfolio of proprietary brands and various proprietary product launches. The percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales related to consumable products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 72.1 , which was an increase from 69.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in consumable sales as a percentage of net sales was driven mainly by increased brand adoption of proprietary growing media and nutrient products. 
 
 Additionally, net sales of commercial fixtures within our Storage Solutions segment decreased to 20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a similar volume of projects with a decrease in average project size. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 113.8 million, a decrease of 13.0 million or 10.2 compared to 126.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The corresponding reduction in cost of sales as compared to the 14.2 decrease in net sales, as previously discussed, was offset by the additional 1.0 million of inventory disposal costs incurred related to the restructuring plan as well as reduced inventory discounts from vendors and other non-recurring costs associated with store consolidations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit was 37.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 49.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 12.0 million or 24.2 . The decrease in gross profit is primarily related to the Gardening and Cultivation segment, which decreased 10.8 million, or 27.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely as a result of the decrease in sales volume due to store 
 25 

consolidations and the effects of the strategic restructuring plan, including the estimated 0.9 million in inventory sales discounts and the additional 1.0 million of inventory disposal costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as previously discussed. Additionally, gross profit from our Storage Solutions segment decreased 1.2 million, or 11.9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the decrease in revenue. 
 
 Gross profit margin was 24.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 330 basis points from a gross profit margin of 28.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely driven by the Gardening and Cultivation segment, which had a gross profit margin of 21.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the effects of the strategic restructuring plan, including the inventory disposal costs and inventory sales discounts, reduced inventory discounts from vendors, and continued industry pricing compression on distributed products. 
 
 The gross profit margin for the Storage Solutions segment remained relatively flat at 44.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 43.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses are comprised of store operations and other operational expenses, selling, general, and administrative, estimated credit losses, depreciation and amortization, and impairment loss. Operating expenses were 65.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 71.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 5.7 million or 8.0 . 
 
 Store operating costs and other operational expenses, which consisted primarily of payroll, rent and utilities, and allocated corporate overhead costs, were 30.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 36.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 5.4 million or 14.9 . The decrease in store operating costs was primarily due to the fiscal 2023 consolidation of 6 retail locations after September 30, 2023 as well as the 19 retail locations closed to date in fiscal 2024, including the 12 redundant or underperforming retail locations consolidated in conjunction with the restructuring plan. This decrease was partially offset by the additional 0.7 million of restructuring costs incurred the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to exiting those retail locations and the related employee termination benefits. Additionally, as part of our 2023 charitable initiatives, we had approximately 0.4 million more charitable donations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Total corporate overhead, which is comprised of selling, general, and administrative expense, estimated credit losses, and depreciation and amortization expense, decreased to 34.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 35.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.5 million or 1.6 . Selling, general, and administrative costs increased by 0.5 million or 2.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of one-time severances and related professional fees and increased marketing expenses related to various proprietary product launches. This increase was offset by the estimated credit recoveries of 0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a 0.3 million settlement received in bankruptcy proceedings related to a note receivable, as compared to the estimated credit loss of 0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the increase in selling, general, and administrative expense was offset by a net 0.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included increased depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment of approximately 1.5 million driven by the accelerated depreciation and amortization for certain capitalized software assets reassessed as part of our restructuring activities and decreased amortization expense related to intangible assets of approximately 1.6 million as a result of intangible asset impairments in fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 In conjunction with our strategic restructuring activities, we assessed and impaired the right-of-use assets of certain closed retail locations for which we anticipated the total remaining lease cost for the term to be greater than the anticipated sublease income, which resulted in an impairment loss of 0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Other income (expense) was 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily attributable to the 0.9 million gain recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to a prior acquisition indemnity holdback.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 
 The following non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income (loss), gross profit, and gross profit margin, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods, identify trends affecting our business, and project future performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and reporting purposes, and we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance, our ability to generate cash, and valuation. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions routinely received from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to net income (loss) as indicators of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). GrowGeneration defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude certain items such as stock-based compensation, impairment losses, restructuring and corporate rationalization costs, and other non-core or non-recurring expenses and to include income from our marketable securities as these investments are part of our operational business strategy and increase the cash available to us. 
 
 Set forth below is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss (in thousands):

 (3) Consists primarily of expenditures related to the activity of store and distribution consolidation and one-time severances outside of the restructuring plan announced July 2024 

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin 
 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to gross profit or gross profit margin, defined as our gross profit as a percentage of net sales, as indicators of operating performance (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). GrowGeneration calculates Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude the effects related to the strategic restructuring plan, and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of net sales.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 98.0 million compared to working capital of 116.5 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 18.5 million. The decrease in working capital from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was due primarily to a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as a result of net cash used in operating activities as well as reductions in inventory and common stock repurchases. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 55.2 million. Currently, we are not aware of any extraordinary demands, commitments, or uncertainties that would materially reduce our current working capital. Our material future cash requirements from contractual and other obligations relate primarily to our operating leases. Refer to Note 8, Leases, of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding leases. 
 
 We may need additional financing through equity offerings and/or debt financings in the future to continue to expand our business consistent with our growth strategies. However, management believes that the Company is adequately funded to support current and future operations in the next twelve months. To date we have financed our operations through the issuance of common stock, convertible notes, and warrants, as well as cash generated from operations. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On March 20, 2024, the Board of Directors of GrowGeneration authorized a share repurchase program, whereby we could repurchase up to 6.0 million worth of our common stock in open market transactions pursuant to Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act and a 10b5-1 trading plan. The program began on April 1, 2024. This share repurchase program was intended to enhance long-term shareholder value. The program did not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to acquire any shares over any specific period of time. The timing and amount of any repurchases was dependent upon factors such as the stock price, trading volumes, market conditions, and regulatory requirements. The stock repurchase program could be amended, suspended, or discontinued at any time by GrowGeneration. Except for the our generally applicable insider trading policies, we do not maintain any policies or procedures relating to purchases and sales of its securities by our officers and directors during a repurchase program. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of common stock for 1.8 million, an average price of 2.36 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for 6.0 million, an average price of 2.38 per share. As of September 30, 2024, we had completed all purchases available under the stock repurchase program. We retired 1.7 million and 2.5 million shares of common stock repurchased under the program in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Cash Flows 
 
 The following discussion sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.9 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in operating cash were primarily driven by the increased net loss as previously discussed. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash and cash equivalents provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.7 million compared to net cash used by investing activities of 11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to investment of excess cash into marketable securities of 41.9 million, offset by maturity of marketable securities of 50.3 million. We also had purchases of property and equipment of 1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to investment of excess cash into marketable securities of 85.8 million, offset by maturity of marketable securities of 83.4 million, and purchases of property and equipment of 6.0 million, which was primarily related to the implementation and design of a new enterprise resource planning software system. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.2 million, primarily attributable to common stock repurchased under our share repurchase program. Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.2 million, related primarily to common stock withheld for employee payroll taxes. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Judgements, and Estimates 
 
 For a summary of the Company's critical accounting policies, judgements, and estimates, please refer to Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Off Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 For a summary of the Company's quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, please refer to Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, 
 29 

no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our organization have been or will be prevented or detected. 
 
 As of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Our management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management as of December 31, 2023 (described below). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Control Activities 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Our management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and overseen by the Board of Directors, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that: 
 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately, and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of its management and directors; and 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework ). As a result of this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024 because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed below. 
 
 30 

Control Environment: The Company did not maintain an effective control environment based on the criteria established in the COSO framework, which resulted in deficiencies in principles associated with the control environment. 
 
 In addition, the following material weaknesses were previously identified and contributed to the material weakness in the control environment: 
 
 Insufficient resources within the accounting and financial reporting department to review the accounting of complex financial reporting transactions including areas such as business combinations, share based compensation, and the related income tax reporting 
 Ineffective controls over updating and distributing accounting policies and procedures across the organization. 
 
 The control environment material weaknesses contributed to other material weaknesses within our system of internal controls over financial reporting related to the following COSO components: 
 
 Risk Assessment: The Company did not design and implement an effective risk assessment based on the criteria established in the COSO framework and identified deficiencies in the principles associated with the risk assessment component of the COSO framework. 
 Information and Communication: The Company did not have an effective information and communication process that identified and assessed the source of and controls necessary to ensure the reliability of information used in financial reporting and that communicates relevant information about roles and responsibilities for internal control over financial reporting. 
 Monitoring Activities: The Company did not have effective monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting, including the continued appropriateness of control design and level of documentation maintained to support control effectiveness. 
 Control Activities: As a consequence of the material weaknesses described above, internal control deficiencies related to the design and operation of process-level controls and general information technology controls were determined to be pervasive throughout the Company's financial reporting processes. 
 
 In addition, the following material weaknesses were previously identified and contributed to the material weakness in control activities: 
 
 Inadequate information and technology general controls, including segregation of duties, change management, and user access, which were inadequate to support financial reporting applications and support automated controls and functionality. 
 Inadequate controls over physical inventory counts. 
 Inadequate controls over valuations, inclusive of appropriate valuation model inputs and appropriate forecasting for prospective financial information. 
 Inadequate segregation of duties within human resources, manual journal entry posting processes, and various bank accounts of the Company to prevent and detect unauthorized transactions in a timely manner. 
 
 While these material weaknesses did not result in material misstatements of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and management does not believe that these material weaknesses resulted in material misstatements as of September 30, 2024, these material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures in annual or interim consolidated financial statements may not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. 
 
 The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, which audited the 2023 consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K, has expressed an adverse opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Remediation Plan and Status 
 
 Our management is committed to remediating identified control deficiencies (including both those that rise to the level of a material weakness and those that do not), fostering continuous improvement in our internal controls, and enhancing our overall internal controls environment. 
 
 We initiated many of our control remediation efforts in fiscal 2022, and these efforts have continued through 2024, including: 
 
 31 

Engaged a third-party specialist CPA firm to consult with management in redesigning and documenting of our internal controls over financial reporting, including our entity-level controls, to be compliant with Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"). 
 Hired a dedicated controls compliance manager charged with monitoring and facilitating compliance with the Company's responsibilities under SOX in coordination with the third-party specialist. 
 Implemented a global risk and compliance software to assist in monitoring and documenting compliance with SOX. 
 Made significant progress related to our control design and assessment, including the identification of risks arising from inappropriate segregation of duties and fraud risks and the development of new controls and revised the design of existing controls to mitigate the aforementioned risks, inclusive of entity-level controls. 
 For certain processes, developed new and revised existing process narratives and flowcharts and identified risks inherent to those processes. 
 Conducted training sessions with control owners. 
 Restructured or consolidated certain business functions to align more closely with effective business operation as well as to enable appropriate segregation of duties. 
 Implemented new business systems, including an enterprise resource planning software system, to support information technology general controls, appropriate segregation of duties, appropriate journal entry posting processes, change management, and user access. 
 Added personnel to the accounting and financial reporting department with technical accounting experience to act as internal resources for reviewing complex financial reporting transactions, including areas such as business combinations, share based compensation, and income tax reporting. 
 Continue to engage third party specialists to assist management with complex financial transactions and valuations, including valuation model techniques and inputs such as forecasted, prospective financial information. 
 
 The following remaining activities are scheduled to occur during our fiscal year 2024 in support of issuing management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024: 
 
 Testing design and operating effectiveness of newly implemented controls across all financial reporting processes and information technology environments. 
 Finalization of risk assessments, control design, and implementation of new and revised controls, inclusive of general information technology controls and entity-level controls, as necessary. 
 Ongoing training with control owners. 
 Developing effective communication plans to all parties responsible for remediation relating to, among other things, identification of deficiencies and recommendations for corrective actions. 
 Providing periodic compliance reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Our management believes that these remediation actions, when fully implemented, will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. However, our remediation efforts are ongoing and additional remediation initiatives may be necessary. We will continue to implement and document the strengthening of existing and the development of new policies, procedures, and internal controls. 
 
 Remediation of the identified material weaknesses and strengthening our internal control environment has required and will continue to require a substantial effort throughout 2024. We will test the ongoing operating effectiveness of the new and existing controls in future periods. The material weaknesses cannot be considered completely remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 While we believe the steps taken to date and those planned for implementation will remediate the ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we have not completed all remediation efforts identified herein. Accordingly, as we continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the areas affected by the material weaknesses described above, we have and will continue to perform additional procedures prescribed by management, including the use of manual mitigating control procedures and employing any additional tools and resources deemed necessary, to ensure that our Consolidated Financial Statements are fairly stated in all material respects. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, except for the implementation of remediation plans to address the material weaknesses discussed above, during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
