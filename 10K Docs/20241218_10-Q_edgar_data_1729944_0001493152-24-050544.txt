statistical extrapolation of of charges from a sample of 38 claims for the periods July 2017 to November 2020 for Progressive
Health Rehabilitation, Ltd Progressive Health ). The Company entered into a management agreement with Progressive
Health in April 2019 and therefore liable for only a portion of the sampled claims. There were a total of 38 claims reviewed, 25 of these
claims were from the period prior to the management agreement with the Company and the remaining 13 claims were related to the period
that Progressive Health was managed by the Company. In December 2021, the Company received a request for payment from CMS in the amount
of . The Company has begun its own internal audit process and has initiated the appropriate appeals. The Company submitted
a redetermination request in March 2022, which was denied. The Company submitted a reconsideration request February 27, 2023. On July
5, 2023, the Company received a reconsideration decision from the second appeal. The Qualified Independent Contractor provided a partially
favorable decision that medical necessity supported 15 of 38 appealed claims. The Company filed a timely appeal and a hearing
with an Administrative Law Judge was conducted November 29, 2023. The ALJ decision received on February 7, 2024, failed to address appeal
and partially favorable decision impact on the extrapolated charges. The Company timely filed an appeal to Medicare Appeals Council on
April 5, 2024. 

Advantage
Therapy 

On
May 17, 2022, the Company received notification from Covent Bridge Group, a Center for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS contractor, that they are recommending to CMS that the Company was overpaid in the amount of related to Advantage Therapy.
This amount represents a statistical extrapolation of charges from a sample, the actual amount found to be overpaid was . On
May 27, 2022, the Company received a request for payment from CMS in the amount of . The Company has begun its own internal
audit process and has initiated the appropriate appeals. Prior to this May 2022 notification, CMS had implemented a pre-payment audit
for Advantage Therapy. As of June 30, 2023, this audit had resulted in a recoupment balance of approximately million of Medicare
accounts receivable. The Company submitted a reconsideration request in May 2023. On August 4, 2023, the Company received a reconsideration
decision from the second appeal. The Qualified Independent Contractor provided a partially favorable decision supporting
31 of 65 appealed claims. The Company filed a timely appeal and conducted a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge February 20, 2024,
and awaits the response from the hearing. As of December 31, 2023, this audit had resulted in a balance of approximately of
Medicare accounts receivable which has been fully reserved. 

Kentucky 

On
December 9, 2022, the Company received a suspension of payment notification from Covent Bridge Group, a Center for Medicare Medicaid
Services contractor, for IMAC Regeneration Center of Kentucky. On December 22, 2022, the Company responded to the payment suspension
with a Rebuttal of Notice. The suspension of payment will remain in effect until the Rebuttal of Notice is answered. The Company provided
medical records for 10 beneficiaries. Neither CMS nor Covent Bridge have responded to the Company regarding the records, although they
initiated the Kepro audit noted in the following paragraph. As of December 31, 2023, the payment suspension resulted in a recoupment
balance of approximately of Medicare accounts receivable which has been fully reserved. 

On
October 2, 2023, the Company received notice from Kepro, Initial Sanction Notice of Failure in a Substantial Number of Cases .
Kepro has recommended a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). (i) Perform a root cause analysis (RCA) and describe the underlying cause of the
failure. Submit a copy of the RCA performed. (ii) Identify goals (desired outcomes) of the CAP. These goals must be measurable-containing
a numerator and denominator-attainable, and meaningful. (iii) Explain how the process(es) will be created or modified to correct the
underlying root cause. (iv) Explain how the process(es) will be implemented, including time frames for implementation. (v) Explain how
the implemented process(es) and outcomes will be monitored and reported. (vi) Identify the person who will be responsible for monitoring
the CAP s specified time frame. The Company intends on complying with the recommendations of the CAP. In addition, after further
review, the Company will appeal the recommendation and outcomes of the audit by Kepro. A meeting with Kepro was conducted on November
20, 2023 to review findings, CAP, and appeal of findings. The meeting resulted in a CAP and communication to medical providers regarding
the audit. There was no financial recoupment request. 

At
this stage of the appeals process, based on the information currently available to the Company, the Company is unable to predict the
timing and ultimate outcomes of these matters and therefore is unable to estimate the range of possible loss. Any potential loss may
be classified as errors and omissions for which insurance coverage was in place during a majority of the years being evaluated. 

As
of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has not recorded a provision for any of these claims, as management does not believe
that an estimate of a possible loss or range of loss can reasonably be made at this time.

price of for each Preferred Share and Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock) for aggregate proceeds of . Such
investment is referred to as the PIPE Financing . As of November 14, 2024, the Company consummated the PIPE Financing.
Additional sales of Series G Preferred Stock and related Warrants may be made in future closings. The Company has used of
the proceeds of the PIPE Financing to repay of outstanding promissory notes of the Company and intends to use the remainder
of the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes. 

Third party audit 

On November 22, 2024, following
a post-payment records review, the Company received notification from Covent Bridge Group that it estimates The Ozzie Smith Center in
St. Louis, MO was overpaid CMS funds in the amount of . That estimated extrapolated overpayment is associated with
claims of service from February 26, 2020 through January 2, 2024. It followed the review of 83 claim line items and an actual overpayment
of for claims with dates of service from September 1, 2022 through October 4, 2022. The Company is currently planning
to appeal by filing a redetermination request. 

Lease 

The Company and its subsidiary are in default in a foreclosure action regarding a lease for its former clinic location in Tampa, Florida. The Company has surrendered the premises and is in discussions with the landlord regarding outstanding amounts. At present, we cannot evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or estimate the amount or range of potential loss.

Overview 

The
continuing operations of the business is precision medicine in cancer treatment based on activated protein analysis. The Company has
acquired laboratory capabilities from Theralink Technologies, Inc, and has the technical capability and intellectual property licenses
to engage in clinical testing of breast cancer patients to determine which medications and treatments will be most effective. The Company
also engages in collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies to identify drug targets based on activated protein analysis. Drug makers
benefit from the application of our technology in target identification, clinical trial design, and clinical trial execution. Ultimately
our technology will be used to both gain FDA approval for treatments and also determine which patients will most benefit from those treatments. 

We
were a provider of movement and orthopedic therapies and minimally invasive procedures performed through our regenerative and rehabilitative
medical treatments to improve the physical health of our patients. Given the Company s financial position during 2023, the Company
decided to close its underperforming locations and sold it s remaining practices.

Significant
financial metrics 

Significant
financial metrics of the Company for the second quarter of 2024 are set forth in the bullets below. 

Working
 capital deficit is 3.3 million) as of June 30, 2024 compared to a working capital deficit of 0.8) million as of December 31,

The
 Company had revenues of 15K from the collaboration with biopharmaceutical companies. 

Matters
that May or Are Currently Affecting Our Business 

We
believe that the growth of our business and our future success depend on various opportunities, challenges, trends and other factors,
including the following: 

Our
 ability to obtain additional financing for the projected costs associated with the asset purchase and the personnel involved, if
 and when needed; 

Our
 ability to attract competent, skilled laboratory and sales personnel for our laboratory operations at acceptable prices to manage
 our overhead; and 

Our
 ability to control our operating expenses and our ability to prove the asset acquisition will be beneficial to our Company and stockholders. 

On
May 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement with Theralink (the Settlement Agreement pursuant
to which the parties agreed to a settlement of the default by Theralink under the previously announced Credit Agreement dated April 11,
2024 between the Company as Lender and Theralink as Borrower (the Theralink Credit Agreement ). The settlement consists
of the transfer of all of the assets of Theralink, other than certain excluded assets, and certain liabilities, to the Company in exchange
for (i) the forgiveness by the Company of the outstanding amounts due under (a) certain secured notes of Theralink to be held by the
Company pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement among the Company and holders of such notes and (b) the Theralink Credit Agreement
and (ii) the issuance to Theralink of the Company s newly created Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value (the Series
E Preferred Stock ). In addition, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to mutual releases with respect to the
outstanding payments being forgiven, the Company and Theralink agreed to terminate the merger agreement between them and withdraw the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 related thereto as soon as commercially practicable, and the Company agreed to assume certain liabilities
of Theralink and to hire certain of the employees of Theralink. 

On
May 6, 2024, in light of having already acquired the Theralink assets, the Company, IMAC Merger Sub, Inc. Merger Sub and Theralink entered into a Termination Agreement, which immediately terminated the Merger Agreement.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ),
which require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations
would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after
taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an
ongoing basis. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Management
has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.
Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Results
of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 

In
2023, the Company decided to discontinue business activities related to its underperforming clinic locations and BackSpace retail stores.
As of December 31, 2023, all locations had been closed and all assets had been sold. We owned our medical clinics directly or had entered
into long-term management services agreements to operate and control these medical clinics by contract. Our preference was to own the
clinics; however, some state laws restrict the corporate practice of medicine and require a licensed medical practitioner to own the
clinic. Accordingly, our managed clinics were owned exclusively by a medical professional within a professional service corporation (formed
as a corporation or a limited liability company) under common control with us in order to comply with
state laws regulating the ownership of medical practices. We were compensated under management services agreements through service fees
based on the cost of the services provided, plus a specified markup percentage, and a discretionary annual bonus determined in the sole
discretion of each professional service corporation.

Revenues
from continuing operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 consisted of 15,750 from Biopharmaceutical companies. 

Revenues
 Discontinued Operations 

Our
revenue mix was diversified between medical treatments and physiological treatments. Our medical treatments were further segmented into
traditional medical and regenerative medicine practices. We were an in-network provider for traditional physical medical treatments,
such as physical therapy, chiropractic services and medical evaluations, with most private health insurance carriers. Regenerative medical
treatments are typically not covered by insurance, but paid by the patient. For more information on our revenue recognition policies,
see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition. 

Operating
Expenses Continuing Operations 

Operating
expenses consist of laboratory supplies, salaries and benefits, share based compensation, advertising and marketing, general and administrative
expenses and depreciation expenses. 

Laboratory supplies 

Laboratory
supplies consists of supplies necessary to perform clinical tests. 

Laboratory
supplies for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately 37,000 due to the acquisition of the laboratory in
the quarter. 

Salaries and benefits 

Salaries
and benefits consist of payroll, benefits and related party contracts. 

Salaries
and benefits expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, remained flat due
to the decrease in the staff in 2023 from the closure of the clinics and the additional staff in 2024 due to the laboratory acquisition.
The expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased due to the lower staff
count in the first four months of 2024. 

General and administrative
expense (G A 

General
and administrative expense G A consist of all other costs than advertising and marketing, salaries and benefits,
patient expenses and depreciation. 

G A
increased 510,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 due to the additional
costs associated with adding the laboratory in the quarter. G A decreased 378,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared
to the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to the sale or closure of all locations in 2023 and the addition of the laboratory in 2024. 

Depreciation 

Depreciation
is related to our property and equipment purchases to use in the course of our business activities. Amortization is related to our
business acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization decreased due to the sale of assets and impairment of intangibles assets for
the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. Depreciation was consistent for the three months
ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023.

Analysis
of Cash Flows 

The
primary source of our operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from patients, private insurance companies, government
programs, self-insured employers and other payors. 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in operations decreased to approximately 0.9 million compared to 1.7 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to our lower net loss for the six months ended June 30,
2024 and discontinuance of our operations in 2023. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 0.4) and 1.1 million, respectively.
This was attributed to the sale of Louisiana Orthopedic operations during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 2.0 million and 0.02 million,
respectively. The increase is due to the issuance of notes payable and preferred stock. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had 0.9 million in cash and negative working capital of 3.3 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash of 0.2
million and negative working capital of 0.8 million. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to the use of cash for operating
expenses and minimal revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had approximately 4.5 million in current liabilities. Approximately 1.1 million of our current liabilities outstanding
were to our vendors. The current portion of our operating lease liability accounted for approximately
 0.1 million of our current liabilities. 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 57.7 million. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund
future operations. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed or favorable terms,
or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our
development or acquisition activity. Failure to receive additional funding could also cause us to cease operations, in part or in full.
Furthermore, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current of future operating plans, we may seek additional capital due
to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations. Our management team has determined that our financial condition raises substantial
doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Private
Offering 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company sold 1,276, 17,364, 24,172 and 450 shares of Series C-2, Series D, Series E and Series
F respectively for gross proceeds of 1.35 million . 

In
connection with the sale of Preferred Stock, the Company issued common stock purchase warrants of 2.7 million with a weighted average
exercise price of 2.74. 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2024, certain investors exchanged 4,550 shares of Series B-1 and B-2 for shares of Series C-1. The share
exchange was recorded at a de minimis value.

Impact
of Inflation 

We
believe that inflation had a material impact on our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Inflation
was evident in staffing and supply costs related to the delivery of patient care. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not
have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

As
further discussed below, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that, because of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting,
our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of June
30, 2024. The material weaknesses are as follows: 

1. We
 do not have sufficient resources in our accounting department, which restricts our ability
 to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting, including
 applying complex accounting principles relating to consolidation accounting, related party
 transactions, fair value estimates, accounting contingencies and analysis of financial instruments
 for proper classification in the consolidated financial statements, in a timely manner; 

2. Due
 to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible
 and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of
 transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed
 by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation
 of duties during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that
 the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

We
hired a consulting firm to advise on technical issues related to U.S. GAAP as related to the maintenance of our accounting books and
records and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Although we are aware of the risks associated with not having dedicated
accounting personnel, we are also at an early stage in the development of our business. We anticipate expanding our accounting functions
with dedicated staff and improving our internal accounting procedures and separation of duties when we can absorb the costs of such expansion
and improvement with additional capital resources. In the meantime, management will continue to observe and assess our internal accounting
function and make necessary improvements whenever they may be required. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material
weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered
or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and we could be required to restate
our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness and if we are unable to produce
accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with
applicable stock exchange listing requirements. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework
(2013) , our management concluded that, because of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of June 30,
2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, as
described below. Litigation is, however, subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise
from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that we believe would or
could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on us. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such proceedings
or claims may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable
preliminary interim rulings.

 RISK
 FACTORS 

Except
for the additional or updated risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes to our Risk Factors as disclosed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2024. 

Risks
Related to our Business 

If
we are unable to successfully integrate the assets we purchased from Theralink, our financial results could be adversely affected. 

On
May 1, 2024, we acquired certain assets of Theralink. The Company is still in the process of integrating such assets into its control
and business. On May 30, 2024, we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ignite, to operate a medical lab, deliver services related to the
assets we acquired from Theralink and collect fees for services rendered. Ignite is in the process of obtaining credentials for reimbursement
for our Ignite test by Medicare and certain third-party payors. Until such time as Ignite is credentialed, we will accept payment from
private insurers. Our Board has also approved the creation of the Ignite Compassionate Care program to enable those without private insurance
or private funds to access our Ignite test when needed until we are credentialed and thereafter for those without access to any form
of insurance. Any failure of the Company to obtain additional license agreement assignments, obtain credentials for reimbursement by
Medicare and certain other third party providers or otherwise integrate the acquired assets limit our ability to generate or increase
revenue and could adversely affect our financial results. 

We
will need additional funding to achieve our goals and may be unable to raise additional capital when needed, which would force us to
delay, reduce or eliminate our product development and commercialization efforts. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our
existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies. 

We
expect to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to continue the development and commercialization of our technology.
We may not be able to generate significant revenues for several years, if at all. Until such time as we can generate substantial service
revenues, we may attempt to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, government and/or other third-party grants
or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our investors ownership
interest will be diluted. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability
to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to
obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more research or development programs, which would
adversely impact potential revenues, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot be certain that additional funding will
be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or
eliminate one or more of our research and development activities. 

We
may fail completely to implement key elements of our growth and expansion strategy, which could adversely affect our operations and financial
performance. 

On
May 30, 2024, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Ignite, to operate a medical lab, deliver services related to the assets we acquired
from Theralink and collect fees for services rendered. Ignite is in the process of obtaining credentials for reimbursement for our Ignite
test by Medicare and certain third-party payors. Until such time as Ignite is credentialed, we will accept payment from private insurers.
Our Board has also approved the creation of the Ignite Compassionate Care program to enable those without private insurance or private
funds to access our Ignite test when needed until we are credentialed and thereafter for those without access to any form of insurance. 

If
we cannot implement one or more key elements of our growth and expansion strategy, including raising sufficient capital, hiring and retaining
qualified staff, leasing and developing acceptable premises for our medical clinics, securing necessary service contracts on favorable
or adequate terms, generating sufficient revenue and achieving numerous other objectives, our projected financial performance may be
materially adversely affected. Even if all of the key elements of our growth and expansion strategy are successfully implemented, we
may not achieve the favorable results, operations and financial performance that we anticipate. 

21 

We
may be required to recognize goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived asset impairment charges. 

Goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to impairment testing at least annually. Future events may cause
impairments of our goodwill or long-lived assets based on factors such as the price of our common stock, projected cash flows, assumptions
used or other variables. Acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of the certain assets of Theralink, may require us to record
an increase in goodwill and intangible assets, which have the risk of impairment if the future operating results and cash flows of such
acquisitions are lower than our initial estimates. In the event that we determine that there is an impairment, we may be required to
record a significant non-cash charge to earnings that could adversely affect our results of operations. 

We
are susceptible to risks relating to investigation or audit by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS ),
health insurance providers and the IRS. 

We
may be audited by CMS or any health insurance provider that pays us for services provided to patients. Any such audit may result in reclaimed
payments, which would decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial performance. Our federal tax returns may be audited by
the IRS and our state tax returns may be audited by applicable state government authorities. Any such audit may result in the challenge
and disallowance of some of our deductions or an increase in our taxable income. We are currently involved in certain such ongoing audits
based on our previous regenerative medicine business. No assurance can be made with regard to the deductibility of certain tax items
or the position taken by us on our tax returns. Further, an audit or any litigation resulting from an audit could unexpectedly increase
our expenses and adversely affect financial performance and operations. 

Our
financial results could be adversely affected by liabilities from our discontinued operations. 

Until
recently, we were a provider of movement and orthopedic therapies and minimally invasive procedures performed through our regenerative
and rehabilitative medical treatments to improve the physical health of our patients at our chain of IMAC Regeneration Centers and BackSpace
clinics which we owned or managed. As of December 31, 2023, we sold or discontinued patient care at all our locations including The BackSpace
LLC. 

Like
other medical providers, our discontinued operations were subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S. Criminal
charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm
and increased public interest in a matter could result from government investigations of our discontinued business. 

If
we fail to achieve and sustain commercial success for our services, our business will suffer, our future prospects may be harmed, and
our stock price would likely decline. 

Prior
to our acquisition of assets from Theralink, Theralink sold or marketed its product on a very limited basis. Unless we can continue to
successfully commercialize our services or acquire the right to market other approved products or services, our business will be materially
adversely affected. Our ability to generate revenues for our services will depend on, and may be limited by, a number of factors, including
the following: 

acceptance of and ongoing satisfaction of our services by the medical community, patients receiving therapy and third-party payors in
the United States, and eventually in foreign markets if we receive marketing approvals abroad; 

our ability to develop and expand market share for analyzing late-stage cancer patients, both in the United States and potentially in
the rest of the world if we receive marketing approvals outside of the United States, in the midst of numerous competing technologies
for late-stage cancer, many of which are already generally accepted in the medical community; 

adequate coverage or reimbursement for our services by government healthcare programs and third-party payors, including private health
coverage insurers and health maintenance organizations; and 

the ability of patients to afford any required co-payments for our services. 

22 

Our
competitors may develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective, safer or reach the market sooner, which may diminish
or eliminate the commercial success of any products we may commercialize. 

Competition
in the cancer information field is intense and accentuated by the rapid pace of advancements in product development. Further, research
and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs that render potential technologies obsolete before they generate revenue. 

Many
universities and private and public research institutes may in the future become active in cancer research, which may be in direct competition
with us. 

Some
of our competitors in the cancer predictive biomarker space have substantially greater research and development capabilities than we
do. Their processing, marketing, financial and managerial resources may be greater than ours. Acquisitions of competing companies by
large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies could enhance our competitors resources. In addition, our competitors may obtain
patent protection or FDA approval and commercialize predictive biomarkers more rapidly than we do, which may impact future sales of our
technology. We expect that competition among technology options will be based, among other things, on price, safety, reliability, availability,
patent protection, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our profitability and financial position will suffer if our technology
cannot compete effectively in the marketplace. 

Failure
to retain key personnel could impede our ability to develop our technology and to obtain new collaborations or other sources of funding. 

Companies
like ours depend upon our scientific staff to discover new technologies and predictive biomarker. They utilize these biomarkers to recommend
treatment guidance for cancer patients. The quality and reputation of our scientific, clinical and regulatory staff, especially the senior
staff, and their success in performing their responsibilities, may directly influence the success of our technology development program. 

Hiring
and retention is difficult to manage, particularly in light of continually evolving laws relating to noncompete and non-solicitation
agreements, including the Federal Trade Commission s rule banning most noncompete agreements, which is currently being challenged
by several business entities. We face intense competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research
institutions, government entities and other organizations. In some cases, our competitors have required their employees to agree to non-compete
and/or non-solicitation agreements as part of their employment. We also may not be able to enter such arrangements. Both scenarios present
challenges and potential costs. Additionally, in some cases our relationship with a customer may be impacted by turnover in our team. 

As
we pursue successful commercialization of Ignite products, we will need to hire sales and marketing, and operations executive management
staff in order to ensure our organizational success. In addition, we require additional executive officers to provide strategic and operational
guidance. Our inability to recruit key management, scientific, clinical, regulatory, medical, operational and other personnel, may delay
or prevent us from achieving our business objectives. 

We
must rely on relationships with third-party suppliers to supply necessary resources used in our technology. These relationships are not
easy to replace. 

We
rely upon others for resources used in the production of predictive biomarkers for the Ignite assay. Problems with any of our suppliers 
facilities or processes could result in failure to produce or a delay in production of adequate information used in the production of
the Ignite assay. This could delay or reduce commercial sales and materially harm our business. Any prolonged interruption in the operations
of our suppliers facilities could result in a shortfall in the information necessary to complete our assay. 

23 

Our
prospective revenues will be diminished if payors do not adequately cover or reimburse our services. 

There
has been and will continue to be significant efforts by both federal and state agencies to reduce costs in government healthcare programs
and otherwise implement government control of healthcare costs. In addition, private payors continually seek ways to reduce and control
overall healthcare costs. An increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of
healthcare services. Uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new applications and services. Third-party payors,
including governmental payors such as Medicare and private payors, are scrutinizing new medical products and services and may not cover
or may limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for our services. Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients
for any of our existing service candidates or for tests we discover and develop, and a substantial portion of the testing for which we
bill our hospital and laboratory clients may ultimately be paid by third-party payors. Likewise, any pricing pressure exerted by these
third-party payors on our clients may, in turn, be exerted by our clients on us. If the government and other third-party payors do not
provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our tests, it could adversely affect our operating results, cash flow and our financial
condition. 

Regulatory
changes, such as proposed government regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests, could require us to conduct additional clinical trials
or result in delays, increased costs, or the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, which could harm our business. 

We
intend to develop diagnostic tests for clients that cannot currently be provided using test kits approved or cleared by the FDA. The
FDA has been considering changes to the way that it regulates these LDTs. Currently, all LDTs are conducted and offered in accordance
with CLIA, and individual state licensing procedures. The FDA has published a draft guidance document that would require FDA clearance
or approval of a subset of LDTs, as well as a modified approach for some lower risk LDTs that may require FDA oversight short of the
full premarket approval or clearance process. Congress may enact legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the FDA s role
with regard to LDTs. As a result, there is a risk that the FDA s proposed regulatory process could delay the offering of certain
tests and result in additional validation costs and fees. This FDA approval or clearance process may be time-consuming and costly, with
no guarantee of ultimate approval or clearance. 

In
2014, FDA issued draft guidance announcing that it would end its historical policy of enforcement discretion regarding LDTs and outlining
the first of multiple frameworks that have been proposed for their regulation. FDA announced in 2016 that it no longer planned to finalize
its draft guidance and that it would continue to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On January 13, 2017, the FDA published
a non-binding Discussion Paper proposing a framework of LDT oversight largely consistent with the draft guidance, to
spur further dialogue and give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution. 
Recent agency announcements made in the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency have produced a shifting policy landscape and
further uncertainty regarding FDA s role in regulating LDTs: in August 2020, HHS announced that FDA would not require premarket
review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement withdrawing that prior announcement,
indicating a return to FDA s longstanding approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs. 

Congress
has also considered a number of legislative proposals in recent years that would amend the regulatory framework for LDTs, including,
among other requirements, FDA premarket review of certain LDTs. The most recent such proposal, the VALID Act, was introduced in both
the House and Senate on June 24, 2021. A competing legislative proposal, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories Act
of 2021 VITAL Act ), was introduced in the Senate on May 18, 2021. However, it remains uncertain whether Congress will
enact legislation regulating LDTs, and, if so, whether the legislation will be similar to the framework described in FDA s 2014
draft guidance or Discussion Paper, or either the VITAL or VALID Acts. It is possible that legislation and resulting FDA regulation may
result in increased regulatory burdens and costs for us to seek marketing authorization for and maintain ongoing compliance for our existing
tests, any modifications thereto, or any future tests we may develop. If the government begins to regulate our tests, it could require
a significant volume of applications, which would be burdensome. Furthermore, governmental bodies could take a long time to review such
applications and/or document responses if other laboratories were also required to file applications and/or document responses for each
of their LDTs. 

In
the event that the FDA begins to regulate our tests, it may require additional pre-market clinical testing prior to submitting a regulatory
notification or application for commercial sales. Such pre-market clinical testing could delay the commencement or completion of clinical
testing, significantly increase our test development costs, delay commercialization of any future tests, and interrupt sales of our current
tests. Additionally, the results of pre-clinical trials or previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and clinical
trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Many of the factors that may cause or lead
to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or
approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors,
including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, and the eligibility
criteria for the clinical trial. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our tests and/or to achieve sustained profitability.

If
we are unable to safeguard against security breaches with respect to our information systems, our business may be adversely affected. 

In
the course of our business, we gather, transmit and retain confidential information through our information systems. Although we endeavor
to protect confidential information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, it is possible that
an individual or group could defeat security measures and access sensitive information about our business and employees. Any misappropriation,
loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the
operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our employees, third parties and investors. We could also incur significant
costs implementing additional security measures and organizational changes, implementing additional protective technologies, training
employees or engaging consultants. In addition, we could incur increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber-security breach.
We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally
identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, a cyber-security breach or other act and/or disruption
to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results
of operations. 

We
are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be adequate and may not be available to
us at a reasonable rate in the future. 

Our
business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of our technology.
We may be subject to liability for errors in the test results we provide to oncologists or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate
reliance upon, the information we provide. We have commercial product liability insurance coverage. However, this insurance coverage
may not be adequate to cover all claims against us. There is also a risk that adequate insurance coverage will not be available in the
future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The successful assertion of an uninsured product liability or other claim against
us could cause us to incur significant expenses to pay such a claim, could adversely affect our predictive biomarker development or technology
sales and could cause a decline in our revenues. Even a successfully defended product liability claim could cause us to incur significant
expenses to defend such a claim, could adversely affect our predictive biomarker development and could cause a decline in our revenues.
In addition, product liability claims could result in an FDA or equivalent non-United States regulatory authority investigation of the
safety or efficacy of our test, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs. 

We
have exposure to general uncertainty and complex legal matters regarding the patents we license. 

The
patent positions of companies such as ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy
regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of method of use patents or reformulation patents has emerged in the
United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the
patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology and to
enforce the patent rights that we license, and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop
third parties from using, selling, offering to sell, or importing technology that infringe on our intellectual property will depend in
part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to
both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending
patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may
be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology or the methods of use. Patent and other intellectual
property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third
parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our technology. The issued patents that we in-license
and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors
from marketing related technology or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our technology. In addition,
the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors
with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the
rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect
to our technology. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential technology,
it is possible that, before any particular technology can be commercialized, any patent protection for such technology may expire or
remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 

25 

If
we are unable to protect the proprietary rights we license or to defend against infringement claims, we may not be able to compete effectively
or operate profitably. 

We
develop predictive biomarkers that are the basis for or incorporated in our potential testing products. We protect our technology through
United States and foreign patent filings, trademarks and trade secrets that we license from others. 

The
fact that we may file a patent application or that a patent has been issued does not ensure that we will have meaningful protection from
competition with regard to the underlying technology. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated, declared unenforceable or circumvented
or may not cover all applications we may desire. Any pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents. Patents
may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with, or who could develop, similar or competing
technologies or who could design around our patents. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the pharmaceutical field in which
we operate is continually evolving and can be the subject of some uncertainty. The laws providing patent protection may change in a way
that would limit our protection. 

We
also rely on trade secrets and know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require
our officers, employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors
to execute confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual
during the course of their relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances.
We also require signed confidentiality agreements from companies that receive our confidential data. For employees, consultants and contractors,
we require confidentiality agreements providing that all inventions conceived while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us
as our exclusive property. It is possible, however, that these parties may breach those agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies
for such a breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets or know-how will otherwise become known to or be independently developed
by competitors. 

We
are also subject to the risk of claims, whether meritorious or not, that our technology infringes or misappropriates third-party intellectual
property rights. Defending against such claims can be quite expensive even if the claims lack merit. If we are found to have infringed
or misappropriated a third-party s intellectual property, we could be required to seek a license or discontinue using certain technologies
or delay commercialization of the affected technologies, and we could be required to pay substantial damages, which could materially
harm our business. 

We
may be subject to litigation with respect to the ownership and use of intellectual property that will be costly to defend. The outcome
of such a defense in uncertain. 

Our
business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships,
or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory
to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us. That litigation is likely to be expensive and may require
a significant amount of management s time and attention, at the expense of other aspects of our business. 

Litigation
relating to the ownership and use of intellectual property is expensive, and our position as a relatively small company in an industry
dominated by very large companies may cause us to be at a disadvantage in defending our intellectual property rights and in defending
against claims that our technology infringes or misappropriate third-party intellectual property rights. Even if we are able to defend
our position, the cost of doing so may adversely affect our profitability. We may in the future be subject to patent litigation and may
not be able to protect our intellectual property at a reasonable cost if such litigation is initiated. The outcome of litigation is always
uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities or
otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 

26 

Obtaining
and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements
imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

Periodic
maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications may be due to be paid
to the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ), GMU, the NIH, Vanderbilt and various governmental patent agencies
outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental
patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent
application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply with these requirements. In many cases,
an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there
are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or
complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market creating
a material adverse effect on our business. 

We
may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 

Filing,
prosecuting and defending patents on our technology in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual
property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws
of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States.
Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from
selling or importing technologies using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our
technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own technologies and may also export infringing
technologies to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These technologies
may compete with ours and our patents or other intellectual property rights. 

Risks
Related to Our Securities 

Our
stock price is volatile and an investment could decline in value. 

The
market price of our common stock fluctuates substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. During the
52-week period ending August 16, 2024, the market price of our common stock ranged from a low of 1.2176 to a high of 7.75. These fluctuations
could cause you to lose all or part of the value of your investment in our common stock and/or warrants. Factors that could cause fluctuations
in the market price of our common stock include the following: 

quarterly variations in our results of operations; 

results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; 

results of operations that vary from those of our competitors; 

changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts; 

publication of research reports about us or the outpatient medical clinic business; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments; 

27 

announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us; 

changes affecting the availability of financing in the outpatient medical services market; 

regulatory developments in the outpatient medical clinic business; 

significant future sales of our common stock; 

additions or departures of key personnel; 

the realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this prospectus; and 

general economic, market and currency factors and conditions unrelated to our performance. 

In
addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate
to operating performance of individual companies. These broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock,
regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities,
securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities
and, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management s attention and resources. 

Our
issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of Common Stock. 

Our
Board of Directors is authorized to issue series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our holders of Common Stock, known
as blank check preferred stock. Our Board of Directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms
of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our Common Stock
with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future
that has preference over our Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our Common Stock, the rights of holders of our Common
Stock or the price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected. In particular, as of August 12, 2024 we had issued and outstanding
2,614 Series C-1 Preferred Shares, 1,276 Series C-2 Preferred Shares, 17,364 Series D Preferred Shares, up to 24,172 Series E Preferred
Shares, and 450 Series F Preferred Shares which are convertible into an aggregate of 13,237,229 shares of our common stock. Additional
information about the rights, preferences and designations of our issued and outstanding Preferred Stock is set forth in Description
of Securities. 

We
are an emerging growth company and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to
public companies may result in our consolidated financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As
a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive
to investors. 

As
a public reporting company with less than 1.235 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth
company under the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements that are
otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company, we: 

are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management s assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing
how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as compensation discussion and analysis 

28 

are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements
(commonly referred to as the say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden-parachute votes); 

are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure; 

may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management s Discussion Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD and 

are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under 107 of the
JOBS Act. 

We
intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the
adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under 107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may
make it difficult to compare our consolidated financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth
companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under 107 of the JOBS Act. 

Certain
of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a smaller
reporting company under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation
and report regarding management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, are not required to provide a compensation
discussion and analysis, are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure, and may present only two
years of audited financial statements and related MD A disclosure. 

Under
the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our
initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act, or such earlier time
that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be
an emerging growth company if we have more than 1.235 billion in annual revenue, have more than 700 million in market
value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than 1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a
three-year period. Under current SEC rules, however, we will continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company for so
long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than 250 million as of the last
business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. 

We
may not be able to maintain the listing of our Common Stock on Nasdaq, which may adversely affect the flexibility of holders of Common
Stock to resell their securities in the secondary market. 

On
May 31, 2023, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that the Company has failed to maintain a required minimum of 2,500,000 in stockholders 
equity for continued listing, as required under Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Minimum Equity Rule ). On August 3, 2023, the
Company submitted a plan to Nasdaq to grant the Company an extension of time until November 27, 2023 to provide evidence of compliance
with the Minimum Equity Rule, and by filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, which includes (1) disclosure of Nasdaq s deficiency
letter and the specific deficiency or deficiencies cited; (2) a description of the completed transaction or event that enabled the Company
to satisfy the stockholders equity requirement for continued listing; (3) an affirmative statement that, as of the date of the
report, the Company believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders equity requirement based upon the specific transaction
or event referenced in item (2) above; and (4) a disclosure stating that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company s ongoing
compliance with the stockholders equity requirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence
compliance, that it may be subject to delisting. The Company attended a Nasdaq Listing Hearing on February 20, 2024. Nasdaq agreed to
extend the Company s listing based on specific conditions for continued listing. The various transactions described above relating
to the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock, the Series F Preferred Stock, the acquisition
of the Theralink assets and the forgiveness of the debt of Theralink contributed positively to the Company s stockholders 
equity. On July 17, 2024, we were notified by Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with Minimum Equity Rule. We remain subject to a
one-year Panel Monitor as that term is defined by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B). 

29 

If
the Company is unable to continue to meet the continued listing criteria of Nasdaq and the Common Stock became delisted, trading of the
Common Stock could thereafter be conducted in the over-the-counter markets in the OTC Pink, also known as pink sheets or,
if available, on another OTC trading platform. Any such delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing
sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the loss of confidence in our financial stability by suppliers, customers
and employees. Investors would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate market quotations for, the Common Stock,
as the liquidity that Nasdaq provides would no longer be available to investors. In addition, the failure of our Common Stock to continue
to be listed on the Nasdaq could adversely impact the market price for the Common Stock and our other securities, and we could face a
lengthy process to re-list the Common Stock, if we are able to re-list the Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the Company will
continue to meet the continued listing criteria of Nasdaq and that the Common Stock will remain listed on Nasdaq. 

If
our product were to become the subject of concerns related to its efficacy, safety, or otherwise, our ability to generate revenues from
our product could be seriously harmed. 

With
the use of any newly marketed technology by a wider patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially
do not appear to relate to the technology itself. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved technology,
cause us to modify how we market our approved technology, subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our revenues and
financial condition. In the event of a withdrawal of our product from the commercial market, our revenues would decline significantly
and our business would be seriously harmed and could fail. 

Adoption
of our product for the analysis of patients with either early stage or advanced cancer may be slow or limited for a variety of reasons,
including competing therapies and perceived difficulties in the treatment process or delays in obtaining reimbursement. If our product
is not broadly accepted as a technology option for cancer, our business would be harmed. 

The
rate of adoption of our product for early stage or advanced cancer and the ultimate market size will be dependent on several factors,
including the education of treating physicians on the information provided by our product. A significant portion of the prospective patient
base for the product may be under the care of oncologists who may have little or no experience with our technology. Acceptance by oncologists
of our product may be slow and may require us to educate physicians on the benefits of using our technology. 

To
achieve global success for our product as a technology, we will need to obtain approvals by foreign regulatory authorities. Data from
our completed clinical trials of our product may not be sufficient to support approval for commercialization by regulatory agencies governing
the sale of drugs outside of the United States. This could require us to spend substantial sums to develop sufficient clinical data for
licensure by foreign authorities. Submissions for approval by foreign regulatory authorities may not result in marketing approval by
these authorities. In addition, certain countries require pricing to be established before reimbursement for the specific technology
may be obtained. We may not receive or maintain marketing approvals at favorable pricing levels or at all, which could harm our ability
to market our product globally. Cancer is common in many regions where the healthcare support systems are limited and reimbursement for
our product may be limited or unavailable, which will likely limit or slow adoption in these regions. If we are unable to successfully
achieve the full global market potential of our product due to diagnostic practices or regulatory hurdles, our future prospects would
be harmed, and our stock price could decline. 

Our
product in clinical development may be limited in use if we do not maintain or gain required regulatory approvals . 

Our
clinical business may be subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States
and potentially by foreign regulatory authorities, with regulations differing from country to country. 

30 

Obtaining
regulatory approval for marketing of a technology candidate in one country does not assure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval
in other countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory
process in other countries. 

In
general, the FDA and equivalent other country authorities require labeling, advertising and promotional materials to be truthful and
not misleading and marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. If the FDA
or other regulatory authorities were to challenge our promotional materials or activities, they may bring enforcement action. 

Regulatory
authorities could also add new regulations or reform existing regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain
approval of our technology. Our product is a novel technology. As a result, regulatory agencies lack experience with it, which may lengthen
the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our product outside of the United
States. We are unable to predict when and whether any changes to regulatory policy affecting our business could occur, and such changes
could have a material adverse impact on our business. If regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations
in the research and development of our predictive biomarkers, they may not approve the technology candidate and we would not be able
to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our technology candidate, our business and results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected. 

We
could face competition from other technologies and products that could impact our profitability . 

We
may face competition in Europe from other technologies and products, and we expect we may face competition from those technologies and
products in the future in the United States as well. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors
are able to obtain broader marketing approval for predictive biomarkers, our technology will become subject to increased competition.
Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding
the validity and/or scope of our patents. We cannot predict the end results other technologies or other competing products could have
on the future potential sales of our services. 

We
use hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive. 

Our
operations produce hazardous waste products, including chemicals, radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Although we believe
that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials complies with the standards prescribed by state and federal
laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. We generally contract
with third parties for the disposal of such hazardous waste products. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration OSHA ), the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA ). Additionally, we must comply
with the regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other regulatory statutes,
and may in the future be subject to other federal, state or local regulations. OSHA and/or the EPA may promulgate regulations that may
affect our research and development programs. We may be required to incur further costs to comply with current or future environmental
and safety laws and regulations. In addition, in the event of accidental contamination or injury from these materials, we could be held
liable for any damages that result, including remediation, and any such liability could exceed our resources.

of Personal Liability . To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director
of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended after the effective date hereof to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited
to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI by the stockholders of
the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such
repeal or modification or with respect to events occurring prior to such time. 

6.2 Indemnification . 

(A) Each
person who was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter, a proceeding ), by reason of the fact
that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including
service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity
as such director, officer, employee, or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as such director, officer, employee, or
agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights than the DGCL permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against
all expense, liability, and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, other expenses and losses, amounts paid or
to be paid in settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased
to be a director, officer, employee, or agent, and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, and administrators;
 provided , however , that, except as provided in paragraph (B) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or
part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VI shall be a contract right
and shall include the right of a director or officer to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided , however , that the payment
of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity
in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer including, without limitation, service to an employee
benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking,
which undertaking shall itself be sufficient without the need for further evaluation of any credit aspects of the undertaking
or with respect to such advancement, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that such director or officer is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise. 

Page 5 

(B) If
a claim under paragraph (A) of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim,
together with reasonable evidence as to the amount of such claim, has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of
a claim for advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees), in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20)
days, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and,
if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense, including attorneys fees,
of prosecuting such suit. It shall be a defense to any such suit, other than a suit brought to enforce a claim for expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking,
if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation, that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it
permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such
defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board or a committee thereof, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of
the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board or a committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption
that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification
or to advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of
an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification, or to such advancement of expenses,
under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 

(C) The
right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred
in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 

(D) The
Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation
or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any such expense, liability, or loss, whether
or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability, or loss under the DGCL. 

(E) In
the case of a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses against the Corporation under this Article VI arising out of
acts, events, or circumstances for which the claimant, who was at the relevant time serving as a director, officer, employee,
or agent of any other entity at the request of the Corporation, may be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses
pursuant to such other entity s certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or other governing document, or a contractual agreement
between the claimant and such entity, the claimant seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder shall first seek
indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to any such governing document or agreement. To the extent that amounts to
be paid in indemnification or advancement to a claimant hereunder are paid by such other entity, the claimant s right to
indemnification and advancement of expenses hereunder shall be reduced. 

(F) Neither
any amendment nor repeal of this Article VI, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent
with this Article VI, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VI in respect of any matter occurring, or any action
or proceeding accruing or arising or that, but for this Article VI, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or
adoption of an inconsistent provision. 

Page 6

VII

and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application
in a summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers
appointed for the Corporation under 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution
or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting
of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may
be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the
creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree
to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement,
the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application
has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders,
of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation. 

ARTICLE
VIII 

Unless
the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall
be the sole and exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (B) any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation
or the Corporation s stockholders, (C) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or (D)
any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine as such doctrine exists under the law of the State of Delaware. 

ARTICLE
IX 

The
Corporation reserves the right to restate this Certificate of Incorporation and to amend, alter, change, or repeal any provision
contained in this Certificate of Incorporation (including any rights, preferences or other designations of Preferred Stock) in
the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors, and officers
are subject to this reserved power. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, and in addition
to any other vote that may be required by law or the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 66-2/3 of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision
of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with the purpose and intent of, Section 4.3 of Article IV, Article V, Article
VI or this Article IX (including, without limitation, any such Article as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration,
change, repeal or adoption of any other Article).

3.
To accomplish the foregoing amendments, the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended by striking Section

that represented shares of Old Common Stock shall receive upon surrender of such certificate a new certificate representing the
number of whole shares of New Common Stock into which the shares of Old Common Stock represented by such certificate shall have
been reclassified. From and after the Effective Time, the term New Common Stock as used in this Section 4.1 shall
mean Common Stock as otherwise used in this Certificate of Incorporation. 

4.

of dividends. Payment of dividends in shares of Common Stock shall otherwise occur pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) herein and, solely for
purposes of the payment of dividends in shares, the Dividend Payment Date shall be deemed the Conversion Date. Dividends shall cease

Section
5 . Liquidation . 

a)
 Senior Liquidation Preference . Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary
(a Liquidation ), the Holders shall, on a pro rata basis, be entitled to receive out of the assets, whether capital
or surplus, of the Corporation, before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock or
Common Stock, the greater of the following amounts:

the aggregate Stated Value of the Preferred Shares; or 

ii)
the amount the Holder would be entitled to receive if the Preferred Stock were fully converted (disregarding for such purposes any conversion
limitations hereunder) to Common Stock which amounts shall be paid pari passu with all holders of Common Stock. 

If,
upon any such Liquidation, the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay
the Holders the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Section 5(a), the Holders shall share ratably in any distribution
of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares
held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full. 

The
Corporation shall mail written notice of any such Liquidation, not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the payment date stated therein,
to each Holder. 

Section
6 . Conversion . 

a)

Stock by the Conversion Price. Holders shall effect conversions by providing the Corporation with the form of conversion notice attached
hereto as Annex A (a Notice of Conversion ). Each Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares
of Preferred Stock to be converted, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned prior to the conversion at issue, the number of shares
of Preferred Stock owned subsequent to the conversion at issue and the date on which such conversion is to be effected, which date may
not be prior to the date the applicable Holder delivers by facsimile or email such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (such date,
the Conversion Date ). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be
the date that such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation is deemed delivered hereunder. No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall
be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be required.
The calculations and entries set forth in the Notice of Conversion shall control in the absence of manifest or mathematical error. To
effect conversions of shares of Preferred Stock, a Holder shall not be required to surrender the certificate(s) representing the shares
of Preferred Stock to the Corporation unless all of the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby are so converted, in which case
such Holder shall deliver the certificate representing such shares of Preferred Stock promptly following the Conversion Date at issue.
Shares of Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock or redeemed in accordance with the terms hereof shall be canceled, shall resume
the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and shall not be reissued as Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock. 

b)
Intentionally omitted. 

c)
 Conversion Price . The conversion price for the Preferred Stock shall equal 0.1092 (the Conversion Price ),
subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the
Common Stock that occur after the Original Issue Date as set forth in Section 7 hereof, it being understood that such adjustment cannot
increase the Conversion Price or decrease the number of Conversion Shares. In the event that a stock split, stock combination, reclassification,
payment of stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction of such character that the shares of Common Stock shall be changed
into or become exchangeable for a larger or smaller number of shares (a Stock Event is effected, the Conversion
Price for all Trading Days during such period prior to the effectiveness of such a Stock Event shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such a Stock Event. Such adjustment shall be effective, automatically and without further action of the Corporation or any Holder at
the end of the Registration Adjustment Period. 

d)
 Mechanics of Conversion . 

i.
 Delivery of Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . Not later than the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period
(as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the converting Holder Conversion Shares which shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions representing
the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock so long as the Conversion Shares being acquired
upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock are registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement or if the Conversion
Shares are eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144. On any date of delivery of Conversion Shares, the Corporation shall use its best
efforts to deliver the Conversion Shares required to be delivered by the Corporation under this Section 6 electronically through the
Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, Standard
Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Corporation s
primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to any Notice(s) of Conversion delivered by 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue Date, the
Corporation agrees to deliver the Conversion Shares subject to such notice(s) by 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue
Date, and the Original Issue Date being deemed the Share Delivery Date with respect to any such Notice(s) of Conversion.
For the avoidance of doubt, any change in the standard settlement cycle that may be effected pursuant to regulatory action of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation through Release No. 34-94196, shall, upon effectiveness of such regulatory action,
immediately and automatically update the Corporation s delivery obligations herein. 

ii.
 Failure to Deliver Conversion Shares . If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to
or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation
at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly
return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the
Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion. 

iii.
 Obligation Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares
upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or
inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against
any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder
or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such
Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate
as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. In the event a Holder shall elect
to convert any or all of the Stated Value of its Preferred Stock, the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such
Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason,
unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Preferred Stock of
such Holder shall have been sought and obtained, and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in the amount
of 150 of the Stated Value of Preferred Stock which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion
of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains
judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, cash, upon a properly
noticed conversion. If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder such Conversion Shares pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) by the Share Delivery
Date applicable to such conversion, the Corporation shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for
each 5,000 of Stated Value of Preferred Stock being converted, 25 per Trading Day (increasing to 50 per Trading Day on the third Trading
Day and increasing to 100 per Trading Day on the sixth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after the Share
Delivery Date until such Conversion Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion, provided, however, such amount shall be
limited to a maximum payment of 1,000 for each 5,000 of Stated Value in the case of a bona fide dispute regarding the Notice of Conversion.
Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion
Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law
or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights
shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 

iv.
 Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available
to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery
Date pursuant to Section 6(c)(i), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver
in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating
to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to
any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price
(including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which
the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such
Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Preferred Stock submitted for
conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(c)(i). For example,
if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage
commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts
payable to such Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Corporation, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein
shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation,
a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely deliver Conversion
Shares upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

v.
 Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that it will at all times after the effectiveness of
its reverse stock split, approved by shareholders on July 5, 2023, reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares
of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from preemptive rights
or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less
than the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall be issuable upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock assuming the Floor Price (as defined below), including any Remaining Conversion Shares. The Corporation covenants
that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

vi.
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall
at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with
the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional
shares of Preferred Stock. 

vii.
 Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock, shall be made without charge
to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares,
provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock
and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting
the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation
that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion
and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for
same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. 

e)
 Beneficial Ownership Limitation . The Corporation shall not effect any conversion of the Preferred Stock, and a Holder shall not
have the right to convert any portion of the Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on
the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together
with such Holder or any of such Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )) would beneficially
own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares
of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number
of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Stated Value of Preferred Stock beneficially
owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained
herein (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution
Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 6(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 6(e) applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Stock is convertible (in relation to other securities
owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how many shares of Preferred Stock are convertible
shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be such Holder s
determination of whether the shares of Preferred Stock may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many shares of the Preferred Stock are convertible, in each case subject to the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation
each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph
and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as
to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 6(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock,
a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Corporation s
most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation
or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Upon the written or oral request (which may be via email) of a Holder, the Corporation shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and
in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Preferred
Stock, by such Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 (or, upon election by a Holder via notice
prior to the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock, 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock held by the applicable Holder. A
Holder, upon notice to the Corporation, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 6(e)
applicable to its Preferred Stock provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares
of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Preferred
Stock held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 6(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Corporation and shall only apply
to such Holder and no other Holder. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section 6(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent
with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly
give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred Stock. 

Section

b)
 Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants,
issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record
holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire,
upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such Holder s Preferred Stock (without regard
to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date
on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which
the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however,
to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held
in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation). 

c)
 Pro Rata Distributions . During such time as this Preferred Stock is outstanding, if the Corporation declares or makes any dividend
or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital
or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend,
spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ),
at any time after the issuance of this Preferred Stock, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such
Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common
Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including
without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution,
or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation
in such Distribution provided , however , to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution
would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such
Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent)
and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto
would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). 

d)
 Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly,
in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person in which the Corporation
is not the surviving entity, (ii) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance
or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect,
purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders
of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by
the holders of 50 or more of the outstanding Common Stock or 50 or more of the voting power of the Common Stock, (iv) the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common
Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities,
cash or property, or (v) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase
agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement)
with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or 50 or more of the
voting power of the Common Stock (each a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this
Preferred Stock, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) on the conversion
of this Preferred Stock), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Corporation, if it
is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate Consideration receivable as a result
of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Preferred Stock is convertible immediately
prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) on the conversion of this Preferred Stock). For
purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Corporation shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities,
cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any conversion of this Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate
the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate
of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions
and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock into Alternate Consideration. The Corporation shall cause any
successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 7(d) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder
(without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the holder of this Preferred Stock, deliver
to the Holder in exchange for this Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially
similar in form and substance to this Preferred Stock which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such
Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Preferred
Stock (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Preferred Stock) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a
conversion price which applies the conversion price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value
of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of
shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from
and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation referring to the Corporation 
shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations
of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation
herein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger shall not be considered a Fundamental Transaction. 

e)
 Price Protection. In the event the Corporation issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents within the 24-month period following
the Closing of the Merger, except for any Exempt Issuance (as hereinafter defined), at a price of or with an exercise or conversion price
of less than the Conversion Price, then upon such issuance or sale, the Conversion Price shall be reduced to the sale price or the exercise
or conversion price of the securities issued or sold, provided, however such Conversion Price shall not be reduced below 0.1092 (the
 Floor Price ), which such Floor Price shall not be increased for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, as
a result of a reverse stock split. Exempt Issuance shall mean any sale or issuance by the Company of its Common
Stock or Common Stock Equivalents in connection with (i) full or partial consideration in connection with a strategic merger, acquisition,
consolidation or purchase of the securities or assets of a corporation or other entity (or any division or business unit thereof), including
the Merger, (ii) the Company s issuance of securities in connection with strategic supply, sale or license agreements and other
partnering arrangements so long as such issuances are not for the purpose of raising capital, (iii) the Company s issuance of Common
stock, restricted stock units or the issuances or grants of options to purchase Common Stock to employees, officers or directors, under
an equity incentive plan adopted by a majority of the non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and (iv) securities
issued upon the exercise or exchange of or conversion of any Common Stock Equivalents issued and outstanding on the date this Certificate
of Designations is filed. 

f)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the
case may be. For purposes of this Section 7, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and outstanding. 

g)
 Most-Favored Nation. If any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding and within the 12-month period following the Closing of
the Merger, upon any issuance by the Corporation of any new security, with any term that the Holder reasonably believes is more favorable
to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that the Holder reasonably believes was not similarly
provided to the Holder, then (i) the Holder shall notify the Corporation of such additional or more favorable term within one (1) Business
Day of the public announcement of the issuance or amendment (as applicable) of the respective security, and (ii) such term, at Holder s
option, shall become a part of this Certificate of Designation (regardless of whether the Corporation or Holder complied with the notification
provision hereof or the Purchase Agreement). The types of terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the holder
of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion or exercise discounts, conversion or exercise lookback
periods, and discounts to the Effective Price Per Share of an Offering. If Holder elects to have the term become a part of this Certificate
of Designation, then the Company shall immediately deliver acknowledgment of such adjustment in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Holder (the Acknowledgment within one (1) Business Day of Corporation s receipt of request from Holder
(the Adjustment Deadline ), provided that Company s failure to timely provide the Acknowledgement shall not
affect the automatic amendments contemplated hereby. This Section 7(g) shall not apply to any Exempt Issuance. 

h)

i.

the Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any

with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party, any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation

are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected

exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof
shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided
hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries, the Corporation
shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled

of Preferred Stock to be converted, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned prior to the conversion at issue, the number of shares
of Preferred Stock owned subsequent to the conversion at issue and the date on which such conversion is to be effected, which date may
not be prior to the date the applicable Holder delivers by facsimile or email such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (such date,

payment of stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction of such character that the shares of Common Stock shall be changed
into or become exchangeable for a larger or smaller number of shares (a Stock Event is effected, the Conversion
Price for all Trading Days during such period prior to the effectiveness of such a Stock Event shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such a Stock Event. Such adjustment shall be effective, automatically and without further action of the Corporation or any Holder at
the end of the Registration Adjustment Period. 

d)
 Mechanics of Conversion . 

i.
 Delivery of Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . Not later than the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period
(as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the converting Holder Conversion Shares which shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions representing
the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock so long as the Conversion Shares being acquired
upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock are registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement or if the Conversion
Shares are eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144. On any date of delivery of Conversion Shares, the Corporation shall use its best
efforts to deliver the Conversion Shares required to be delivered by the Corporation under this Section 6 electronically through the
Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, Standard
Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Corporation s
primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to any Notice(s) of Conversion delivered by 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue Date, the
Corporation agrees to deliver the Conversion Shares subject to such notice(s) by 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue
Date, and the Original Issue Date being deemed the Share Delivery Date with respect to any such Notice(s) of Conversion.
For the avoidance of doubt, any change in the standard settlement cycle that may be effected pursuant to regulatory action of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation through Release No. 34-94196, shall, upon effectiveness of such regulatory action,
immediately and automatically update the Corporation s delivery obligations herein. 

ii.
 Failure to Deliver Conversion Shares . If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to
or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation
at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly
return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the
Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion. 

iii.
 Obligation Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares
upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or
inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against
any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder
or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such
Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate
as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. In the event a Holder shall elect
to convert any or all of the Stated Value of its Preferred Stock, the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such
Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason,
unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Preferred Stock of
such Holder shall have been sought and obtained, and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in the amount
of 150 of the Stated Value of Preferred Stock which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion
of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains
judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, cash, upon a properly
noticed conversion. If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder such Conversion Shares pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) by the Share Delivery
Date applicable to such conversion, the Corporation shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for
each 5,000 of Stated Value of Preferred Stock being converted, 25 per Trading Day (increasing to 50 per Trading Day on the third Trading
Day and increasing to 100 per Trading Day on the sixth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after the Share
Delivery Date until such Conversion Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion, provided, however, such amount shall be
limited to a maximum payment of 1,000 for each 5,000 of Stated Value in the case of a bona fide dispute regarding the Notice of Conversion.
Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion
Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law
or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights
shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 

iv.
 Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available
to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery
Date pursuant to Section 6(c)(i), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver
in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating
to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to
any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price
(including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which
the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such
Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Preferred Stock submitted for
conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(c)(i). For example,
if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage
commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts
payable to such Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Corporation, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein
shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation,
a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely deliver Conversion
Shares upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

v.
 Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available
out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock as
herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the
other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less than the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall be issuable
upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock assuming the Floor Price, including any Remaining Conversion Shares.
The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. 

vi.
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall
at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with
the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional
shares of Preferred Stock. 

vii.
 Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock, shall be made without charge
to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares,
provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock
and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting
the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation
that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion
and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for
same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. 

e)
 Beneficial Ownership Limitation . The Corporation shall not effect any conversion of the Preferred Stock, and a Holder shall not
have the right to convert any portion of the Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on
the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together
with such Holder or any of such Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )) would beneficially
own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares
of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number
of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Stated Value of Preferred Stock beneficially
owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained
herein (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution
Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 6(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 6(e) applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Stock is convertible (in relation to other securities
owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how many shares of Preferred Stock are convertible
shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be such Holder s
determination of whether the shares of Preferred Stock may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many shares of the Preferred Stock are convertible, in each case subject to the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation
each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph
and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as
to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 6(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock,
a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Corporation s
most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation
or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Upon the written or oral request (which may be via email) of a Holder, the Corporation shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and
in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Preferred
Stock, by such Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 (or, upon election by a Holder via notice
prior to the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock, 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock held by the applicable Holder. A
Holder, upon notice to the Corporation, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 6(e)
applicable to its Preferred Stock provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares
of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Preferred
Stock held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 6(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Corporation and shall only apply
to such Holder and no other Holder. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section 6(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent
with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly
give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred Stock. 

Section
7 . Certain Adjustments . 

a)
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock
dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any other
Common Stock Equivalents, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues, in the event of
a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, then the Conversion Price shall be
multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation)
outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective
date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b)
 Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants,
issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record
holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire,
upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such Holder s Preferred Stock (without regard
to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date
on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which
the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however,
to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held
in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation). 

c)
 Pro Rata Distributions . During such time as this Preferred Stock is outstanding, if the Corporation declares or makes any dividend
or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital
or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend,
spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ),
at any time after the issuance of this Preferred Stock, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such
Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common
Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including
without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution,
or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation
in such Distribution provided , however , to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution
would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such
Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent)
and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto
would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). 

d)
 Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly,
in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person in which the Corporation
is not the surviving entity, (ii) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance
or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect,
purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders
of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by
the holders of 50 or more of the outstanding Common Stock or 50 or more of the voting power of the Common Stock, (iv) the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common
Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities,
cash or property, or (v) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase
agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement)
with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or 50 or more of the
voting power of the Common Stock (each a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this
Preferred Stock, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) on the conversion
of this Preferred Stock), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Corporation, if it
is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate Consideration receivable as a result
of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Preferred Stock is convertible immediately
prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) on the conversion of this Preferred Stock). For
purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Corporation shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities,
cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any conversion of this Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate
the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate
of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions
and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock into Alternate Consideration. The Corporation shall cause any
successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 7(d) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder
(without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the holder of this Preferred Stock, deliver
to the Holder in exchange for this Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially
similar in form and substance to this Preferred Stock which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such
Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Preferred
Stock (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Preferred Stock) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a
conversion price which applies the conversion price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value
of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of
shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from

increase the Conversion Price or decrease the number of Conversion Shares. In the event that a stock split, stock combination, reclassification,
payment of stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction of such character that the shares of Common Stock shall be changed
into or become exchangeable for a larger or smaller number of shares (a Stock Event is effected, the Conversion
Price for all Trading Days during such period prior to the effectiveness of such a Stock Event shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such a Stock Event. Such adjustment shall be effective, automatically and without further action of the Corporation or any Holder at
the end of the Registration Adjustment Period. 

d)
 Mechanics of Conversion . 

i.
 Delivery of Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . Not later than the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period
(as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the converting Holder Conversion Shares which shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions representing
the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock so long as the Conversion Shares being acquired
upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock are registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement or if the Conversion
Shares are eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144. On any date of delivery of Conversion Shares, the Corporation shall use its best
efforts to deliver the Conversion Shares required to be delivered by the Corporation under this Section 6 electronically through the
Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, Standard
Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Corporation s
primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to any Notice(s) of Conversion delivered by 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue Date, the
Corporation agrees to deliver the Conversion Shares subject to such notice(s) by 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue
Date, and the Original Issue Date being deemed the Share Delivery Date with respect to any such Notice(s) of Conversion.
For the avoidance of doubt, any change in the standard settlement cycle that may be effected pursuant to regulatory action of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation through Release No. 34-94196, shall, upon effectiveness of such regulatory action,
immediately and automatically update the Corporation s delivery obligations herein. 

ii.
 Failure to Deliver Conversion Shares . If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to
or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation
at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly
return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the
Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion. 

iii.
 Obligation Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares
upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or
inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against
any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder
or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such
Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate
as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. In the event a Holder shall elect
to convert any or all of the Stated Value of its Preferred Stock, the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such
Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason,
unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Preferred Stock of
such Holder shall have been sought and obtained, and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in the amount
of 150 of the Stated Value of Preferred Stock which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion
of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains
judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, cash, upon a properly
noticed conversion. If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder such Conversion Shares pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) by the Share Delivery
Date applicable to such conversion, the Corporation shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for
each 5,000 of Stated Value of Preferred Stock being converted, 25 per Trading Day (increasing to 50 per Trading Day on the third Trading
Day and increasing to 100 per Trading Day on the sixth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after the Share
Delivery Date until such Conversion Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion, provided, however, such amount shall be
limited to a maximum payment of 1,000 for each 5,000 of Stated Value in the case of a bona fide dispute regarding the Notice of Conversion.
Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion
Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law
or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights
shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 

iv.
 Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available
to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery
Date pursuant to Section 6(c)(i), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver
in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating
to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to
any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price
(including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which
the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such
Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Preferred Stock submitted for
conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(c)(i). For example,
if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage
commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts
payable to such Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Corporation, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein
shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation,
a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely deliver Conversion
Shares upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

v.
 Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that it will at all times after the effectiveness of
its reverse stock split, approved by shareholders on July 5, 2023, reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares
of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from preemptive rights
or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less
than the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall be issuable upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock assuming the Floor Price (as defined below), including any Remaining Conversion Shares. The Corporation covenants
that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

vi.
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall
at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with
the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional
shares of Preferred Stock. 

vii.
 Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock, shall be made without charge
to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares,
provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock
and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting
the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation
that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion
and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for
same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. 

e)
 Beneficial Ownership Limitation . The Corporation shall not effect any conversion of the Preferred Stock, and a Holder shall not
have the right to convert any portion of the Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on
the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together
with such Holder or any of such Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )) would beneficially
own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares
of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number
of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Stated Value of Preferred Stock beneficially
owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained
herein (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution
Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 6(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 6(e) applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Stock is convertible (in relation to other securities
owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how many shares of Preferred Stock are convertible
shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be such Holder s
determination of whether the shares of Preferred Stock may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many shares of the Preferred Stock are convertible, in each case subject to the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation
each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph
and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as
to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 6(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock,
a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Corporation s
most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation
or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Upon the written or oral request (which may be via email) of a Holder, the Corporation shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and
in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Preferred
Stock, by such Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 (or, upon election by a Holder via notice
prior to the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock, 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock held by the applicable Holder. A
Holder, upon notice to the Corporation, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 6(e)
applicable to its Preferred Stock provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares
of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Preferred
Stock held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 6(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Corporation and shall only apply
to such Holder and no other Holder. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section 6(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent
with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly
give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred Stock. 

Section
7 . Certain Adjustments . 

a)
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock
dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any other
Common Stock Equivalents, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues, in the event of
a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, then the Conversion Price shall be
multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation)
outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective
date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b)
 Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants,
issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record
holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire,
upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such Holder s Preferred Stock (without regard
to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date
on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which
the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however,
to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held
in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation). 

c)
 Pro Rata Distributions . During such time as this Preferred Stock is outstanding, if the Corporation declares or makes any dividend
or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital
or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend,
spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ),
at any time after the issuance of this Preferred Stock, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such
Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common
Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including
without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution,
or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation
in such Distribution provided , however , to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution
would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such
Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent)
and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto
would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). 

d)
 Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly,
in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person in which the Corporation
is not the surviving entity, (ii) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance
or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect,
purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders
of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by
the holders of 50 or more of the outstanding Common Stock or 50 or more of the voting power of the Common Stock, (iv) the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common
Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities,
cash or property, or (v) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase
agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement)
with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or 50 or more of the
voting power of the Common Stock (each a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this
Preferred Stock, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) on the conversion
of this Preferred Stock), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Corporation, if it
is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate Consideration receivable as a result
of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Preferred Stock is convertible immediately
prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) on the conversion of this Preferred Stock). For
purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Corporation shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities,
cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any conversion of this Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate
the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate
of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions
and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock into Alternate Consideration. The Corporation shall cause any
successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 7(d) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder
(without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the holder of this Preferred Stock, deliver
to the Holder in exchange for this Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially
similar in form and substance to this Preferred Stock which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such
Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Preferred
Stock (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Preferred Stock) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a
conversion price which applies the conversion price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value
of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of
shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from
and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation referring to the Corporation 
shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations
of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation
herein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger shall not be considered a Fundamental Transaction. 

e)
 Price Protection. In the event the Corporation issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents within the 24-month period following
the Closing of the Merger, except for any Exempt Issuance (as hereinafter defined), at a price of or with an exercise or conversion price
of less than the Conversion Price, then upon such issuance or sale, the Conversion Price shall be reduced to the sale price or the exercise
or conversion price of the securities issued or sold, provided, however such Conversion Price shall not be reduced below 1.84 (the Floor
Price ), which such Floor Price shall not be increased for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, as a result of
a reverse stock split. Exempt Issuance shall mean any sale or issuance by the Company of its Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents in connection with (i) full or partial consideration in connection with a strategic merger, acquisition, consolidation
or purchase of the securities or assets of a corporation or other entity (or any division or business unit thereof), including the Merger,
(ii) the Company s issuance of securities in connection with strategic supply, sale or license agreements and other partnering
arrangements so long as such issuances are not for the purpose of raising capital, (iii) the Company s issuance of Common stock,
restricted stock units or the issuances or grants of options to purchase Common Stock to employees, officers or directors, under an equity
incentive plan adopted by a majority of the non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and (iv) securities issued
upon the exercise or exchange of or conversion of any Common Stock Equivalents issued and outstanding on the date this Certificate of
Designations is filed. 

f)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the
case may be. For purposes of this Section 7, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and outstanding. 

g)
 Most-Favored Nation. If any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding and within the 12-month period following the Closing of
the Merger, upon any issuance by the Corporation of any new security, with any term that the Holder reasonably believes is more favorable
to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that the Holder reasonably believes was not similarly
provided to the Holder, then (i) the Holder shall notify the Corporation of such additional or more favorable term within one (1) Business
Day of the public announcement of the issuance or amendment (as applicable) of the respective security, and (ii) such term, at Holder s
option, shall become a part of this Certificate of Designation (regardless of whether the Corporation or Holder complied with the notification
provision hereof or the Purchase Agreement). The types of terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the holder
of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion or exercise discounts, conversion or exercise lookback
periods, and discounts to the Effective Price Per Share of an Offering. If Holder elects to have the term become a part of this Certificate
of Designation, then the Company shall immediately deliver acknowledgment of such adjustment in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Holder (the Acknowledgment within one (1) Business Day of Corporation s receipt of request from Holder
(the Adjustment Deadline ), provided that Company s failure to timely provide the Acknowledgement shall not
affect the automatic amendments contemplated hereby. This Section 7(g) shall not apply to any Exempt Issuance. 

h)
 Notice to the Holders . 

i.
 Adjustment to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 7, the Corporation
shall promptly deliver to each record Holder by facsimile or email a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment
and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii.
 Notice to Allow Conversion by Holder . If (A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form)
on the Common Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C)
the Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any
shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required in connection
with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party, any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, then, in each case, the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office or agency
maintained for the purpose of conversion of this Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be delivered by facsimile or email to each record
Holder at its last facsimile number or email address as it shall appear upon the stock books of the Corporation, at least twenty (20)
calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record
is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the
date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants
are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected
to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof
shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided
hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries, the Corporation
shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled
to convert the Conversion Amount of this Preferred Stock (or any part hereof) during the 20-day period commencing on the date of such
notice through the effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.

Price for all Trading Days during such period prior to the effectiveness of such a Stock Event shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such a Stock Event. Such adjustment shall be effective, automatically and without further action of the Corporation or any Holder at
the end of the Registration Adjustment Period. 

d)
 Mechanics of Conversion . 

i.
 Delivery of Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . Not later than the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period
(as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the converting Holder Conversion Shares which shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions representing
the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock so long as the Conversion Shares being acquired
upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock are registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement or if the Conversion
Shares are eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144. On any date of delivery of Conversion Shares, the Corporation shall use its best
efforts to deliver the Conversion Shares required to be delivered by the Corporation under this Section 6 electronically through the
Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, Standard
Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Corporation s
primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to any Notice(s) of Conversion delivered by 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue Date, the
Corporation agrees to deliver the Conversion Shares subject to such notice(s) by 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue
Date, and the Original Issue Date being deemed the Share Delivery Date with respect to any such Notice(s) of Conversion.
For the avoidance of doubt, any change in the standard settlement cycle that may be effected pursuant to regulatory action of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation through Release No. 34-94196, shall, upon effectiveness of such regulatory action,
immediately and automatically update the Corporation s delivery obligations herein. 

ii.
 Failure to Deliver Conversion Shares . If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to
or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation
at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly
return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the
Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion. 

iii.
 Obligation Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares
upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or
inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against
any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder
or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such
Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate
as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. In the event a Holder shall elect
to convert any or all of the Stated Value of its Preferred Stock, the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such
Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason,
unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Preferred Stock of
such Holder shall have been sought and obtained, and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in the amount
of 150 of the Stated Value of Preferred Stock which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion
of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains
judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, cash, upon a properly
noticed conversion. If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder such Conversion Shares pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) by the Share Delivery
Date applicable to such conversion, the Corporation shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for
each 5,000 of Stated Value of Preferred Stock being converted, 25 per Trading Day (increasing to 50 per Trading Day on the third Trading
Day and increasing to 100 per Trading Day on the sixth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after the Share
Delivery Date until such Conversion Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion, provided, however, such amount shall be
limited to a maximum payment of 1,000 for each 5,000 of Stated Value in the case of a bona fide dispute regarding the Notice of Conversion.
Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion
Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law
or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights
shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 

iv.
 Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available
to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery
Date pursuant to Section 6(c)(i), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver
in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating
to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to
any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price
(including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which
the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such
Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Preferred Stock submitted for
conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(c)(i). For example,
if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage
commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts
payable to such Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Corporation, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein
shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation,
a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely deliver Conversion
Shares upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

v. Reservation
of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock as herein
provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other
holders of the Preferred Stock), not less than the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall be issuable upon
the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock assuming the Floor Price, including any
Remaining Conversion Shares. The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue,
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

vi.
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall
at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with
the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional
shares of Preferred Stock. 

vii.
 Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock, shall be made without charge
to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares,
provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock
and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting
the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation
that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion
and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for
same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. 

e)
 Beneficial Ownership Limitation . The Corporation shall not effect any conversion of the Preferred Stock, and a Holder shall not
have the right to convert any portion of the Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on
the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together
with such Holder or any of such Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )) would beneficially
own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares
of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number
of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Stated Value of Preferred Stock beneficially
owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained
herein (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution
Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 6(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 6(e) applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Stock is convertible (in relation to other securities
owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how many shares of Preferred Stock are convertible
shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be such Holder s
determination of whether the shares of Preferred Stock may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many shares of the Preferred Stock are convertible, in each case subject to the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation
each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph
and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as
to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 6(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock,
a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Corporation s
most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation
or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Upon the written or oral request (which may be via email) of a Holder, the Corporation shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and
in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Preferred
Stock, by such Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 (or, upon election by a Holder via notice
prior to the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock, 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock held by the applicable Holder. A
Holder, upon notice to the Corporation, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 6(e)
applicable to its Preferred Stock provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares
of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Preferred
Stock held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 6(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Corporation and shall only apply
to such Holder and no other Holder. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section 6(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent
with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly
give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred Stock. 

Section
7 . Certain Adjustments . 

a)
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock
dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any other
Common Stock Equivalents, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues, in the event of
a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, then the Conversion Price shall be
multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation)
outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective
date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b)
 Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants,
issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record
holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire,
upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such Holder s Preferred Stock (without regard
to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date
on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which
the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however,
to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held
in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation). 

c)
 Pro Rata Distributions . During such time as this Preferred Stock is outstanding, if the Corporation declares or makes any dividend
or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital
or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend,
spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ),
at any time after the issuance of this Preferred Stock, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such
Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common
Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including
without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution,
or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation
in such Distribution provided , however , to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution
would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such
Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent)
and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto
would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). 

d)
 Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly,
in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person in which the Corporation
is not the surviving entity, (ii) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance
or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect,
purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders
of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by
the holders of 50 or more of the outstanding Common Stock or 50 or more of the voting power of the Common Stock, (iv) the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common
Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities,
cash or property, or (v) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase
agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement)
with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or 50 or more of the
voting power of the Common Stock (each a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this
Preferred Stock, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) on the conversion
of this Preferred Stock), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Corporation, if it
is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate Consideration receivable as a result
of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Preferred Stock is convertible immediately
prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) on the conversion of this Preferred Stock). For
purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Corporation shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities,
cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any conversion of this Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate
the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate
of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions
and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock into Alternate Consideration. The Corporation shall cause any
successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 7(d) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder
(without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the holder of this Preferred Stock, deliver
to the Holder in exchange for this Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially
similar in form and substance to this Preferred Stock which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such
Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Preferred
Stock (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Preferred Stock) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a
conversion price which applies the conversion price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value
of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of
shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from
and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation referring to the Corporation 
shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations
of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation
herein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger shall not be considered a Fundamental Transaction. 

e)
 Price Protection. In the event the Corporation issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents within the 24-month period following
the Closing of the Merger, except for any Exempt Issuance (as hereinafter defined), at a price of or with an exercise or conversion price
of less than the Conversion Price, then upon such issuance or sale, the Conversion Price shall be reduced to the sale price or the exercise
or conversion price of the securities issued or sold, provided, however such Conversion Price shall not be reduced below 1.84 (the Floor
Price ), which such Floor Price shall not be increased for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, as a result of
a reverse stock split. Exempt Issuance shall mean any sale or issuance by the Company of its Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents in connection with (i) full or partial consideration in connection with a strategic merger, acquisition, consolidation
or purchase of the securities or assets of a corporation or other entity (or any division or business unit thereof), including the Merger,
(ii) the Company s issuance of securities in connection with strategic supply, sale or license agreements and other partnering
arrangements so long as such issuances are not for the purpose of raising capital, (iii) the Company s issuance of Common stock,
restricted stock units or the issuances or grants of options to purchase Common Stock to employees, officers or directors, under an equity
incentive plan adopted by a majority of the non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and (iv) securities issued
upon the exercise or exchange of or conversion of any Common Stock Equivalents issued and outstanding on the date this Certificate of
Designations is filed. 

f)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the
case may be. For purposes of this Section 7, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and outstanding. 

g)
 Most-Favored Nation. If any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding and within the 12-month period following the Closing of
the Merger, upon any issuance by the Corporation of any new security, with any term that the Holder reasonably believes is more favorable
to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that the Holder reasonably believes was not similarly
provided to the Holder, then (i) the Holder shall notify the Corporation of such additional or more favorable term within one (1) Business
Day of the public announcement of the issuance or amendment (as applicable) of the respective security, and (ii) such term, at Holder s
option, shall become a part of this Certificate of Designation (regardless of whether the Corporation or Holder complied with the notification
provision hereof or the Purchase Agreement). The types of terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the holder
of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion or exercise discounts, conversion or exercise lookback
periods, and discounts to the Effective Price Per Share of an Offering. If Holder elects to have the term become a part of this Certificate
of Designation, then the Company shall immediately deliver acknowledgment of such adjustment in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Holder (the Acknowledgment within one (1) Business Day of Corporation s receipt of request from Holder
(the Adjustment Deadline ), provided that Company s failure to timely provide the Acknowledgement shall not
affect the automatic amendments contemplated hereby. This Section 7(g) shall not apply to any Exempt Issuance. 

h)
 Notice to the Holders . 

i.
 Adjustment to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 7, the Corporation
shall promptly deliver to each record Holder by facsimile or email a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment

on the Common Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C)
the Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any
shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required in connection

of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, then, in each case, the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office or agency
maintained for the purpose of conversion of this Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be delivered by facsimile or email to each record

calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record
is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the

are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected
to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof

shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled

and register such Conversion Shares on the Company s share register or, (II) if the Transfer Agent is participating in FAST and
the Resale Eligibility Conditions are satisfied, to credit such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC for such
number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion of any Conversion Amount (as the case

with such Conversion Failure (a Buy-In ), then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, the Company
shall, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such Holder s request and in such Holder s discretion, either: (I) pay
cash to such Holder in an amount equal to such Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, stock loan costs

issuance and payment under this clause (II) (each, a Buy-In Payment Amount ). Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s
right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing Conversion
Shares (or to electronically deliver such Conversion Shares) upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares as required pursuant to the
terms hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any given Conversion Failure, this Section 4(c)(ii) shall
not apply to a Holder to the extent the Company has already paid such amounts in full to such Holder with respect to such Conversion
Failure pursuant to the analogous sections of the Issuance Agreement.

(iii)

Company and each Holder of the Preferred Shares shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Preferred
Share for all purposes (including, without limitation, the right to receive payments and Dividends hereunder) notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. A Registered Preferred Share may be assigned, transferred or sold only by registration of such assignment or sale on
the Register. Upon its receipt of a written request to assign, transfer or sell one or more Registered Preferred Shares by such Holder
thereof, the Company shall record the information contained therein in the Register and issue one or more new Registered Preferred Shares
in the same aggregate Stated Value as the Stated Value of the surrendered Registered Preferred Shares to the designated assignee or transferee
pursuant to Section 18, provided that if the Company does not so record an assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be) of such
Registered Preferred Shares within two (2) Business Days of such a request, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to
reflect such assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4,
following conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the applicable Holder shall not be required to physically
surrender such Preferred Shares held in the form of a Preferred Share Certificate to the Company unless (A) the full or remaining number
of Preferred Shares represented by the applicable Preferred Share Certificate are being converted (in which event such certificate(s)

notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of the
applicable Preferred Share Certificate. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Stated Value and Dividends converted
and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) or shall use such other method,
reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of a Preferred Share Certificate upon
conversion. If the Company does not update the Register to record such Stated Value and Dividends converted and/or paid (as the case
may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) within two (2) Business Days of such occurrence, then
the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to reflect such occurrence. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records
of the Company establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling and determinative
in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge and agree that,
by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred Shares represented
by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each Preferred Share Certificate shall

TRANSFEREE OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING
TO THE SHARES OF SERIES C-1 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(iii) THEREOF. THE NUMBER
OF SHARES OF SERIES C-1 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES C-1
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(iii) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE
SHARES OF SERIES C-1 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE. 

(iv)
 Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes . In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same
Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert
from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted
for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to
the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of Conversion
Shares issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of
Conversion Shares not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. If a Conversion Notice delivered to the Company
would result in a breach of Section 4(d) below, and the applicable Holder does not elect in writing to withdraw, in whole, such Conversion
Notice, the Company shall hold such Conversion Notice in abeyance until such time as such Conversion Notice may be satisfied without
violating Section 4(d) below (with such calculations thereunder made as of the date such Conversion Notice was initially delivered to
the Company). 

8 

(d)
 Limitation on Beneficial Ownership . The Company shall not effect the conversion of any of the Preferred Shares held by a Holder,
and such Holder shall not have the right to convert any of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Certificate of Designations and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after
giving effect to such conversion, such Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess
of 4.99 (the Maximum Percentage of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder
and the other Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties
 plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination
of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining,
nonconverted Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion
of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes,
convertible preferred stock or warrants, including the Preferred Shares and the Warrants) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other
Attribution Party subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 4(d). For purposes
of this Section 4(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. For the avoidance of
doubt, the calculation of the Maximum Percentage shall take into account the concurrent exercise and/or conversion, as applicable, of
the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such Holder and/or any other Attribution
Party, as applicable. For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion
of such Preferred Shares without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock as reflected in (x) the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on
Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other
written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent, if any, setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the Reported
Outstanding Share Number ). If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify such Holder in writing of the number
of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause such Holder s beneficial
ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(d), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify the Company of a reduced
number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice. For any reason at any time, upon the written or
oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including such Preferred Shares, by such Holder
and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that the
issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of such Preferred Shares results in such Holder and the other Attribution
Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such Holder s and the other
Attribution Parties aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the Excess Shares shall
be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess
Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective
until the sixty-first (61 st day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other
percentage not in excess of 9.99 as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not
be effective until the sixty-first (61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or
decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an Attribution Party
of such Holder. For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of
Designations in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Holder for any purpose including
for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to this
paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination
of convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity
with the terms of this Section 4(d) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be
defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 4(d) or to make changes or supplements
necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall
apply to a successor holder of such Preferred Shares.

of the Preferred Shares, as designated in the Mandatory Conversion Notice (as defined below) into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof at the Conversion Rate as of the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined

Trading Days. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal
Market fails to exceed the Conversion Price by 300 for each Trading Day commencing on the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date and ending
and including the Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date (a Mandatory Conversion Price Failure or an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, (A) the Company shall provide each Holder

shall be null and void and (ii) at any time prior to the date of consummation of the Mandatory Conversion the Preferred Shares subject
to such Mandatory Conversion may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.

the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date and such aggregate number of Preferred Shares converted hereunder on or after the Mandatory
Conversion Notice Date and prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date shall reduce the aggregate number of Preferred Shares of such Holder
required to be converted on such Mandatory Conversion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no right to effect a Mandatory
Conversion if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s
right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. 

10

Event, (II) a certification as to whether, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, such Triggering Event is capable of being cured
and, if applicable, a reasonable description of any existing plans of the Company to cure such Triggering Event and (III) a certification
as to the date the Triggering Event occurred and, if cured on or prior to the date of such Triggering Event Notice, the applicable Alternate
Conversion Right Expiration Date, such Holder may, at such Holder s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice to the Company (the
date of any such Conversion Notice, each an Alternate Conversion Date ), convert all, or any number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder into shares of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, an Alternate Conversion ). 

(ii)
 Mechanics of Alternate Conversion . On any Alternate Conversion Date, a Holder may voluntarily convert any number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder pursuant to Section 4(c) (with Alternate Conversion Price replacing Conversion Price 
for all purposes hereunder with respect to such Alternate Conversion and with the applicable Required Premium multiplied by the
Conversion Amount replacing Conversion Amount in clause (x) of the definition of Conversion Rate in Section 4(b)
above with respect to such Alternate Conversion) by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii)
of this Certificate of Designations that such Holder is electing to use the Alternate Conversion Price for such conversion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4(f)(ii), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Company delivers to such Holder the shares
of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to the applicable Alternate Conversion of such Holder s Preferred Shares,
such Preferred Shares may be converted by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(c) without regard to this Section
4(f)(ii). In the event of an Alternate Conversion pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii) of all, or any portion, of any Preferred Shares of
a Holder, such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict
future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly,
any redemption premium due under this Section 4(f)(ii), together the Alternate Conversion Price used in such Alternate Conversion, as
applicable, is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of, such Holder s actual loss of its investment
opportunity and not as a penalty.

 Rights Upon Fundamental Transactions . 

(a)
 Assumption . The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the Successor Entity assumes in writing
all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 6 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, including
agreements to deliver to each holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for such Preferred Shares a security of the Successor Entity evidenced
by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of Designations, including, without limitation,
having a stated value and dividend rate equal to the stated value and dividend rate of the Preferred Shares held by the Holders and having
similar ranking to the Preferred Shares, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental
Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction,
the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company shall refer
instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the
Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had
been named as the Company herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor
Entity shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares at
any time after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets
or other property (except such items still issuable under Sections 7 and 15, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable
upon the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly traded common
stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) which each Holder would have been entitled to receive
upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior
to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate
of Designations), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 6 to permit the Fundamental
Transaction without the assumption of the Preferred Shares. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly and equally to successive
Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares. 

16 

(b)
 Notice of a Change of Control; Change of Control Election Notice . No sooner than the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Trading Days prior
to the consummation of a Change of Control or (y) the public announcement of the entry into an agreement with respect to a Change of
Control, nor later than ten (10) Trading Days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control (the Change of Control Date ),
the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (a Change of Control
Notice ). At any time during the period beginning after a Holder s receipt of a Change of Control Notice or such Holder
becoming aware of a Change of Control if a Change of Control Notice is not delivered to such Holder in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence (as applicable) and ending on twenty (20) Trading Days after the later of (A) the date of consummation of such Change
of Control or (B) the date of receipt of such Change of Control Notice or (C) the date of the announcement of such Change of Control,
such Holder may require, by delivering written notice thereof Change of Control Election Notice to the Company
(which Change of Control Election Notice shall indicate the number of Preferred Shares subject to such election), to have the Company
exchange such Holder s Preferred Shares designated in such Change of Control Election Notice for consideration equal to the Change
of Control Election Price (as defined below), to be satisfied at the Company s election (such election to pay in cash or by delivery
of the Rights (as defined below), a Consideration Election ), in either (I) rights (with a beneficial ownership limitation
in the form of Section 4(d) hereof, mutatis mutandis (collectively, the Rights ), convertible in whole, or
in part, at any time, without the requirement to pay any additional consideration, at the option of the Required Holders, into such Corporate
Event Consideration (as defined below) applicable to such Change of Control equal in value to the Change of Control Election Price, or
(II) in cash. The Company shall give each Holder written notice of each Consideration Election at least ten (10) Trading Days prior to
the time of consummation of such Change of Control. Payment of such amounts or delivery of the Rights, as applicable, shall be made by
the Company (or at the Company s direction) to each Holder on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Trading Day after the date of such
request and (y) the date of consummation of such Change of Control (or, with respect to any Right, if applicable, such later time that
holders of shares of Common Stock are initially entitled to receive Corporate Event Consideration with respect to the shares of Common
Stock of such holder). Any Corporate Event Consideration included in the Rights, if any, pursuant to this Section 6(b) is pari passu
 with the Corporate Event Consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Common Stock and the Company shall not permit a payment
of any Corporate Event Consideration to the holders of shares of Common Stock without on or prior to such time delivering the Right to
the Holders in accordance herewith. Cash payments, if any, required by this Section 6(b) shall have priority to payments to all other
stockholders of the Company in connection with such Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(b),
but subject to Section 4(d), until the applicable Change of Control Election Price is paid in full to the applicable Holder in cash or
Corporate Event Consideration in accordance herewith, the Preferred Shares submitted by such Holder for exchange or payment, as applicable,
under this Section 6(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 or in the event
the Conversion Date is after the consummation of such Change of Control, stock or equity interests of the Successor Entity substantially
equivalent to the Company s shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 6. In the event of the Company s repayment or exchange,
as applicable, of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 6(b), such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to
estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable
substitute investment opportunity for a Holder. Accordingly, any Required Premium due under this Section 6(b) is intended by the parties
to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in connection with any redemption hereunder at a time a Holder is entitled to receive
a cash payment under any of the other Transaction Documents, at the option of such Holder delivered in writing to the Company, the applicable
redemption price hereunder shall be increased by the amount of such cash payment owed to such Holder under such other Transaction Document
and, upon payment in full or conversion in accordance herewith, shall satisfy the Company s payment obligation under such other
Transaction Document.

issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all
or substantially all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder
will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could
have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares
(without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose
that all the Preferred Shares were converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) held by such Holder
immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record
is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such
Purchase Rights; provided, however, to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result
in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate
in such Purchase Right to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of
Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and such Purchase Right
to such extent shall be held in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision,
such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable) for the benefit of such Holder until such time or
times, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage,
at which time or times such Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase
Right or on any subsequent Purchase Right held similarly in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date
or other similar provision, such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable)) to the same extent as
if there had been no such limitation. 

18 

(b)
 Other Corporate Events . In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any
Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect
to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision to
ensure that each Holder will thereafter have the right, at such Holder s option, to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder (i) such securities or other assets (the Corporate Event Consideration to which such
Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such Holder
upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the
Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon
such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the consummation
of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder
initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion
rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate of an Alternate Conversion. Provision made pursuant the preceding sentence
shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly
and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of
the Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations. 

8.
 Rights Upon Issuance of Other Securities . 

(a)
 Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock . If and whenever on or after the Exchange Date the Company grants,
issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell), or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have granted,

the account of the Company, but excluding any Excluded Securities granted, issued or sold or deemed to have been granted, issued or sold)
for a consideration per share (the New Issuance Price less than a price equal to the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such granting, issuance or sale or deemed granting, issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect is referred
to herein as the Applicable Price (the foregoing a Dilutive Issuance ), then, immediately after
such Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price. For all purposes
of the foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under this Section
8(a)), the following shall be applicable: 

(i)
 Issuance of Options . If the Company in any manner grants, issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell)
any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such
Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and
to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting, issuance or sale of such Option for such price per share. For
purposes of this Section 8(a)(i), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon
the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any
such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of
consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance
or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon
exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for which
one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon the exercise of any such
Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof, minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Option (or any other Person) with
respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion,
exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof plus
the value of any other consideration (including, without limitation, consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or any
other property) received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person). Except as contemplated
below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such
Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof or upon the actual issuance of such
shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

19 

(ii)
 Issuance of Convertible Securities . If the Company in any manner issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to issue or sell)
any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common
Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale (or the time
of execution of such agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes
of this Section 8(a)(ii), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the
lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon the issuance
or sale (or pursuant to the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of the Convertible Security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange
of such Convertible Security or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such Convertible
Security for which one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder
of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale (or the agreement
to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Security plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable (including,
without limitation, any consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or other property) by, or benefit conferred on, the
holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price
shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities
or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of
any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 8(a),
except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issuance or sale. 

(iii)
 Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion . If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible
Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time (other than
proportional changes in conversion or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in Section 8(a) below),
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been
in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional
consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes
of this Section 8(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (including, without limitation, any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the Exchange Date) are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding
sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(a)
shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. 

20 

(iv)
 Calculation of Consideration Received . If any Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right is issued in connection
with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (as determined by the Holder, the Primary
Security , and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the Secondary Securities 
and together with the Primary Security, each a Unit ), together comprising one integrated transaction, the aggregate
consideration per share of Common Stock with respect to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be the lower of (x) the purchase price
of such Unit, (y) if such Primary Security is an Option and/or Convertible Security, the lowest price per share for which one share of
Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Primary Security in accordance with 8(a)(i) or 8(a)(ii) and

Period immediately following the public announcement of such Dilutive Issuance (for the avoidance of doubt, if such public
announcement is released prior to the opening of the Principal Market on a Trading Day, such Trading Day shall be the first Trading Day
in such five Trading Day period and if any Preferred Shares are exercised, on any given Conversion Date during any such Adjustment Period,
solely with respect to such number of Preferred Shares converted on such applicable Conversion Date, such applicable Adjustment Period
shall be deemed to have ended on, and included, the Trading Day immediately prior to such Conversion Date). If any shares of Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor
will be deemed to be the net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the
fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of
consideration received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the
five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount
of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity
as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities (as the case may be). The fair value of any consideration
other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required Holder. If such parties are
unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the Valuation Event ),
the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10 th day following
such Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holder. The determination
of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall
be borne by the Company. 

21 

(v)
 Record Date . If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive
a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale
of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution
or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). 

(b)
 Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision of Section 7 or
Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Exchange Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination,
recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of
shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision
of Section 7 or Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Exchange Date combines (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock
combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
pursuant to this Section 8(b) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any
event requiring an adjustment under this Section 8(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then
the calculation of such Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by rounding to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100 th
 of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or
held by or for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 

(d)
 Voluntary Adjustment by Company . Subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market and Section 8(g) below, the Company
may at any time any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, with the prior written consent of the Required Holder, reduce the then current
Conversion Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board. 

(e)
 Adjustments . If on the Applicable Date (as defined in the Issuance Agreement) (the Adjustment Date ), the
Conversion Price then in effect is greater than the greater of (A) the Floor Price, and (B) the Market Price then in effect (the Adjustment
Price ), on the Adjustment Date the Conversion Price shall automatically lower to the Adjustment Price. 

22 

(f)
 Exchange Right . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates any Subsequent
Placement (other than with respect to Excluded Securities), and a Holder elects in writing to the Company to participate in such Subsequent
Placement, each such Holder may, at the option of such Holder as elected in writing to the Company, exchange all, or any part, of the
Preferred Shares of such Holder into the securities in such Subsequent Placement (with the aggregate amount of such securities to be
issued in such exchange equal to such aggregate amount of such securities with a purchase price valued at 105 of the Conversion Amount
of the Preferred Shares delivered by such Holder in exchange therefor). 

(g)
 Conversion Floor Price . Prior to the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Issuance Agreement), no adjustment pursuant
to this Section 8 shall cause the Conversion Price to be less than 2.561 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination,
reclassification or similar transaction occurring after the date of the Issuance Agreement) (the Conversion Floor Price ).
As of the Stockholder Approval Date, any Dilutive Issuances or other events that would have resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion
Price prior to the Stockholder Approval Date, but for the application of this Section 8(g), shall adjust the Conversion Price hereunder
as if such Dilutive Issuances and/or other events, as applicable, occurred on the Stockholder Approval Date. 

9.
 Redemption at the Company s Election . At any time, the Company shall have the right to redeem all, but not less than all,
of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (the Company Optional Redemption Amount on the Company Optional Redemption
Date (each as defined below) (a Company Optional Redemption ). The Preferred Shares subject to redemption pursuant
to this Section 9 shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price (the Company Optional Redemption Price equal
to the greater of (i) 110 of the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date and (ii) the product of
(1) the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date multiplied by
(2) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding
such Company Optional Redemption Notice Date and ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date the Company makes the entire
payment required to be made under this Section 9. The Company may exercise its right to require redemption under this Section 9 by delivering
a written notice thereof by electronic mail and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders (the Company
Optional Redemption Notice and the date all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date ). Such Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable; provided that the Company Optional
Redemption Notice may be conditioned upon the consummation of a refinancing transaction or a Going Private Transaction. The Company Optional
Redemption Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Optional Redemption shall occur (the Company Optional Redemption
Date which date shall not be less than ten (10) Trading Days nor more than twenty (20) Trading Days following the Company
Optional Redemption Notice Date, and (y) state the aggregate Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares which is being redeemed in such
Company Optional Redemption from such Holder and all of the other Holders of the Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 9 on the Company
Optional Redemption Date. The Company shall deliver the applicable Company Optional Redemption Price to each Holder in cash on the applicable
Company Optional Redemption Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the date the Company Optional
Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Company Optional Redemption Amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares
of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4. All Conversion Amounts converted by a Holder after the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date
shall reduce the Company Optional Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares of such Holder required to be redeemed on the Company Optional
Redemption Date. In the event of the Company s redemption of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 9, a Holder s
damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the
uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium
due under this Section 9 is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss
of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no right to effect a Company Optional
Redemption if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s
right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Going Private Transaction, the
Company may effect a Company Optional Redemption under this Section 9, but with Change of Control Election Price replacing
 Company Optional Redemption Price for all purposes in this Section 9 in connection therewith. 

23 

10.
 Noncircumvention . The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation,
bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate
of Designations, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all action
as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision
of this Certificate of Designations or the other Transaction Documents, the Company (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares
of Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all
action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting
the conversion of the Preferred Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect
the conversion of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if after the sixty (60) calendar day anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder is not permitted
to convert such Holder s Preferred Shares in full for any reason (other than pursuant to restrictions set forth in Section 4(d)
hereof), the Company shall use its best efforts to promptly remedy such failure, including, without limitation, obtaining such consents
or approvals as necessary to effect such conversion into shares of Common Stock. 

11.
 Authorized Shares . 

(a)
 Reservation . So long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company shall at all times reserve at least 200 of the number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion, including without limitation, Alternate Conversions,
of all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding at the Alternate Conversion Price then in effect (without regard to any limitations on
conversions) (the Required Reserve Amount ). The Required Reserve Amount (including, without limitation, each increase
in the number of shares so reserved) shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of the Preferred Shares held by
each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the Authorized Share
Allocation ). In the event that a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder s Preferred Shares, each
transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder s Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved
and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders of Preferred Shares,
pro rata based on the number of the Preferred Shares then held by the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may allocate its
Authorized Share Allocation to any other of the securities of the Company held by such Holder (or any of its designees) by delivery of
a written notice to the Company. 

(b)
 Insufficient Authorized Shares . If, notwithstanding Section 11(a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while any of the
Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock
to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall immediately take all
action necessary to increase the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve
the Required Reserve Amount for the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as
soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after
the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase
in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with
a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of
Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal (or, if a majority
of the voting power then in effect of the capital stock of the Company consents to such increase, in lieu of such proxy statement, deliver
to the stockholders of the Company an information statement that has been filed with (and either approved by or not subject to comments
from) the SEC with respect thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any such time of an Authorized Share Failure, the Company is
able to obtain the written consent of a majority of the shares of its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock to approve the increase
in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, the Company may satisfy this obligation by obtaining such consent and submitting
for filing with the SEC an Information Statement on Schedule 14C. Nothing contained in Section 11(a) or this Section 11(b) shall limit
any obligations of the Company under any provision of the Issuance Agreement or Registration Rights Agreement. 

24 

12.
 Voting Rights . The holders of the Preferred Shares shall have no voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time,
either as a separate series or class or together with any other series or class of share of capital stock, and shall not be entitled
to call a meeting of such holders for any purpose nor shall they be entitled to participate in any meeting of the holders of Common Stock,
except as provided in this Section 12 and Section 16 or as otherwise required by the DGCL. To the extent that under the DGCL the vote
of the holders of the Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given action
of the Company, the affirmative vote or consent of the Required Holders of the Preferred Shares, voting together in the aggregate and
not in separate series unless required under the DGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is presented or by written
consent of the Required Holders (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate
series unless required under the DGCL, shall constitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable. Holders
of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to written notice of all stockholder meetings or written consents (and copies of proxy materials
and other information sent to stockholders) with respect to which they would be entitled to vote, which notice would be provided pursuant
to the Company s bylaws (the Bylaws and the DGCL.

ordinary course of business in a manner and to an extent consistent with past practice and necessary or desirable for the prudent operation

(i) issue any Preferred Shares (other than as contemplated by the Issuance Agreement and this Certificate of Designations and the acquisition

Funds payable to all holders of Preferred Shares and all holders of shares of Parity Stock. To the extent necessary, the Company shall

by way of return of capital or otherwise (including without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property
or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction)

if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Preferred Shares (without taking
into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that the Preferred
Share was converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) immediately prior to the date on which a record
is taken for such Distribution or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined
for such Distributions provided , however , that to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such
Distribution would result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not
be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and the
portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would

of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares hereunder. 

17.

the Company subject only to the provisions of Section 5 of the Issuance Agreement. 

18.
 Reissuance of Preferred Share Certificates and Book Entries . 

(a)

Preferred Shares being transferred by such Holder and, if less than the entire outstanding number of Preferred Shares is being transferred,
a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to such Holder representing the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares not being transferred (or evidence of such remaining Preferred Shares in a Book-Entry for such Holder). Such Holder and any assignee,
by acceptance of the Preferred Share Certificate or evidence of Book-Entry issuance, as applicable, acknowledge and agree that, by reason
of the provisions of Section 4(c)(i) following conversion or redemption of any of the Preferred Shares, the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares represented by the Preferred Shares may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face of the Preferred Shares. 

28 

(b)
 Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Preferred Share Certificate . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Preferred Share Certificate (as to which a written certification and the indemnification
contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking
by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of such Preferred Share Certificate, the Company shall execute and deliver to such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance
with Section 18(d)) representing the applicable outstanding number of Preferred Shares. 

(c)
 Preferred Share Certificate and Book-Entries Exchangeable for Different Denominations and Forms . Each Preferred Share Certificate

outstanding number of the Preferred Shares in the original Preferred Share Certificate, and each such new Preferred Share Certificate
and/or new Book-Entry, as applicable, will represent such portion of such outstanding number of Preferred Shares from the original Preferred
Share Certificate as is designated in writing by such Holder at the time of such surrender. Each Book-Entry may be exchanged into one
or more new Preferred Share Certificates or split by the applicable Holder by delivery of a written notice to the Company into two or
more new Book-Entries (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing, in the aggregate, the outstanding number of the Preferred Shares
in the original Book-Entry, and each such new Book-Entry and/or new Preferred Share Certificate, as applicable, will represent such portion
of such outstanding number of Preferred Shares from the original Book-Entry as is designated in writing by such Holder at the time of
such surrender. 

(d)
 Issuance of New Preferred Share Certificate or Book-Entry . Whenever the Company is required to issue a new Preferred Share Certificate
or a new Book-Entry pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations, such new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry

Preferred Shares remaining outstanding (or in the case of a new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry being issued pursuant to
Section 18(a) or Section 18(c), the number of Preferred Shares designated by such Holder) which, when added to the number of Preferred
Shares represented by the other new Preferred Share Certificates or other new Book-Entry, as applicable, issued in connection with such
issuance, does not exceed the number of Preferred Shares remaining outstanding under the original Preferred Share Certificate or original
Book-Entry, as applicable, immediately prior to such issuance of new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry, as applicable, and
(ii) shall have an issuance date, as indicated on the face of such new Preferred Share Certificate or in such new Book-Entry, as applicable,
which is the same as the issuance date of the original Preferred Share Certificate or in such original Book-Entry, as applicable. 

29 

19.
 Remedies, Characterizations, Other Obligations, Breaches and Injunctive Relief. The remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations
shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations and any of the other Transaction
Documents, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall
limit any Holder s right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of
this Certificate of Designations. No failure on the part of a Holder to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by such Holder of any right, power or remedy preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In addition, the exercise of any right or
remedy of a Holder at law or equity or under this Certificate of Designations or any of the documents shall not be deemed to be an election
of such Holder s rights or remedies under such documents or at law or equity. The Company covenants to each Holder that there shall
be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with
respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by a Holder and shall
not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). No failure
on the part of a Holder to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise by such Holder of any right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In addition, the exercise of any right or remedy of any Holder at law or equity
or under Preferred Shares or any of the documents shall not be deemed to be an election of such Holder s rights or remedies under
such documents or at law or equity. The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable
harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event
of any such breach or threatened breach, each Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to specific performance
and/or temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in any such
case without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting a bond or other security. The Company shall provide all information
and documentation to a Holder that is requested by such Holder to enable such Holder to confirm the Company s compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Certificate of Designations.

Holder or its designee, for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled. If the number of Preferred Shares

(ii)
 Company s Failure to Timely Convert . If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, on or prior to the applicable
Share Delivery Deadline, (I) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in FAST or the Resale Eligibility Conditions are not satisfied,
to issue and deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a certificate for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled
and register such Conversion Shares on the Company s share register or, (II) if the Transfer Agent is participating in FAST and
the Resale Eligibility Conditions are satisfied, to credit such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC for such
number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion of any Conversion Amount (as the case
may be) (a Conversion Failure ), and if on or after such Share Delivery Deadline such Holder acquires (in an open
market transaction, stock loan or otherwise) shares of Common Stock corresponding to all or any portion of the number of Conversion Shares
issuable upon such conversion that such Holder is entitled to receive from the Company and has not received from the Company in connection
with such Conversion Failure (a Buy-In ), then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, the Company
shall, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such Holder s request and in such Holder s discretion, either: (I) pay
cash to such Holder in an amount equal to such Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, stock loan costs
and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so acquired (including, without limitation, by any other Person
in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) (the Buy-In Price ), at which point the Company s obligation to so
issue and deliver such certificate (and to issue such Conversion Shares) or credit to the balance account of such Holder or such Holder s
designee, as applicable, with DTC for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion
hereunder (as the case may be) (and to issue such Conversion Shares) shall terminate, or (II) promptly honor its obligation to so issue
and deliver to such Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Conversion Shares or credit the balance account of such Holder

Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending on the date of such
issuance and payment under this clause (II) (each, a Buy-In Payment Amount ). Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s
right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing Conversion
Shares (or to electronically deliver such Conversion Shares) upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares as required pursuant to the
terms hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any given Conversion Failure, this Section 4(c)(ii) shall
not apply to a Holder to the extent the Company has already paid such amounts in full to such Holder with respect to such Notice
Failure pursuant to the analogous sections of the Issuance Agreement. 

6 

(iii)
 Registration; Book-Entry . At the time of issuance of any Preferred Shares hereunder, the applicable Holder may, by written request
(including by electronic-mail) to the Company, elect to receive such Preferred Shares in the form of one or more Preferred Share Certificates

whether the Preferred Shares are held by such Holder in Preferred Share Certificates or in Book-Entry form (the Registered
Preferred Shares ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The
Company and each Holder of the Preferred Shares shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Preferred
Share for all purposes (including, without limitation, the right to receive payments and Dividends hereunder) notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. A Registered Preferred Share may be assigned, transferred or sold only by registration of such assignment or sale on
the Register. Upon its receipt of a written request to assign, transfer or sell one or more Registered Preferred Shares by such Holder
thereof, the Company shall record the information contained therein in the Register and issue one or more new Registered Preferred Shares
in the same aggregate Stated Value as the Stated Value of the surrendered Registered Preferred Shares to the designated assignee or transferee
pursuant to Section 18, provided that if the Company does not so record an assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be) of such
Registered Preferred Shares within two (2) Business Days of such a request, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to
reflect such assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4,
following conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the applicable Holder shall not be required to physically
surrender such Preferred Shares held in the form of a Preferred Share Certificate to the Company unless (A) the full or remaining number
of Preferred Shares represented by the applicable Preferred Share Certificate are being converted (in which event such certificate(s)
shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(iii)) or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written
notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of the
applicable Preferred Share Certificate. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Stated Value and Dividends converted
and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) or shall use such other method,
reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of a Preferred Share Certificate upon
conversion. If the Company does not update the Register to record such Stated Value and Dividends converted and/or paid (as the case
may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) within two (2) Business Days of such occurrence, then
the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to reflect such occurrence. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records
of the Company establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling and determinative
in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge and agree that,
by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred Shares represented
by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each Preferred Share Certificate shall
bear the following legend:

ANY
TRANSFEREE OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING
TO THE SHARES OF SERIES C-2 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(iii) THEREOF. THE NUMBER
OF SHARES OF SERIES C-2 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES C-2
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(iii) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE
SHARES OF SERIES C-2 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE. 

(iv)
 Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes . In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same
Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert
from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted
for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to
the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of Conversion
Shares issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of
Conversion Shares not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. If a Conversion Notice delivered to the Company
would result in a breach of Section 4(d) below, and the applicable Holder does not elect in writing to withdraw, in whole, such Conversion
Notice, the Company shall hold such Conversion Notice in abeyance until such time as such Conversion Notice may be satisfied without
violating Section 4(d) below (with such calculations thereunder made as of the date such Conversion Notice was initially delivered to
the Company). 

8 

(d)
 Limitation on Beneficial Ownership . The Company shall not effect the conversion of any of the Preferred Shares held by a Holder,
and such Holder shall not have the right to convert any of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Certificate of Designations and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after
giving effect to such conversion, such Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess
of 4.99 (the Maximum Percentage of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder
and the other Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties
 plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination
of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining,
nonconverted Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion
of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes,
convertible preferred stock or warrants, including the Preferred Shares and the Warrants) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other
Attribution Party subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 4(d). For purposes
of this Section 4(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. For the avoidance of
doubt, the calculation of the Maximum Percentage shall take into account the concurrent exercise and/or conversion, as applicable, of
the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such Holder and/or any other Attribution
Party, as applicable. For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion
of such Preferred Shares without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock as reflected in (x) the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on
Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other
written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent, if any, setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the Reported
Outstanding Share Number ). If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify such Holder in writing of the number
of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause such Holder s beneficial
ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(d), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify the Company of a reduced
number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice. For any reason at any time, upon the written or
oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including such Preferred Shares, by such Holder
and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that the
issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of such Preferred Shares results in such Holder and the other Attribution
Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such Holder s and the other
Attribution Parties aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the Excess Shares shall
be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess
Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective
until the sixty-first (61 st day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other
percentage not in excess of 9.99 as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not
be effective until the sixty-first (61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or
decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an Attribution Party
of such Holder. For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of
Designations in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Holder for any purpose including
for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to this
paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination
of convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity
with the terms of this Section 4(d) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be
defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 4(d) or to make changes or supplements
necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall
apply to a successor holder of such Preferred Shares.

the Conversion Price for twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days (each, a Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period ), and
(ii) no Equity Conditions Failure then exists, the Company shall have the right to require each Holder to convert all, or any number,
of the Preferred Shares, as designated in the Mandatory Conversion Notice (as defined below) into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof at the Conversion Rate as of the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined
below) (a Mandatory Conversion ). The Company may exercise its right to require conversion under this Section 4(e)

the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to such Holder on the Mandatory Conversion Date and (iv) that there has been no Equity
Conditions Failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may effect only one (1) Mandatory Conversion during any twenty (20) consecutive
Trading Days. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal
Market fails to exceed the Conversion Price by 300 for each Trading Day commencing on the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date and ending
and including the Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date (a Mandatory Conversion Price Failure or an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, (A) the Company shall provide each Holder
a subsequent notice to that effect and (B) unless such Holder waives the applicable Equity Conditions Failure and/or Mandatory Conversion
Price Failure, as applicable, the Mandatory Conversion shall be cancelled and the applicable Mandatory Conversion Notice of such Holder
shall be null and void and (ii) at any time prior to the date of consummation of the Mandatory Conversion the Preferred Shares subject
to such Mandatory Conversion may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Preferred Shares subject to a Mandatory Conversion may be converted by a Holder hereunder prior to
the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date and such aggregate number of Preferred Shares converted hereunder on or after the Mandatory
Conversion Notice Date and prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date shall reduce the aggregate number of Preferred Shares of such Holder
required to be converted on such Mandatory Conversion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no right to effect a Mandatory
Conversion if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s
right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. 

10 

(ii)

Section 4(e), then it must simultaneously take the same action in the same proportion with respect to all Holders of Preferred Shares.

 General . Subject to Section 4(d), at any time after the later of (A) the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Issuance
Agreement and (B) the earlier of a Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice (as defined below) and such Holder becoming aware
of a Triggering Event (such earlier date, the Alternate Conversion Right Commencement Date and ending (such ending
date, the Alternate Conversion Right Expiration Date , and each such period, an Alternate Conversion Right
Period on the twentieth (20 th Trading Day after the later of (x) the date such Triggering Event is cured and
(y) such Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice that includes (I) a reasonable description of the applicable Triggering
Event, (II) a certification as to whether, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, such Triggering Event is capable of being cured
and, if applicable, a reasonable description of any existing plans of the Company to cure such Triggering Event and (III) a certification
as to the date the Triggering Event occurred and, if cured on or prior to the date of such Triggering Event Notice, the applicable Alternate
Conversion Right Expiration Date, such Holder may, at such Holder s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice to the Company (the
date of any such Conversion Notice, each an Alternate Conversion Date ), convert all, or any number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder into shares of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, an Alternate Conversion ). 

(ii)
 Mechanics of Alternate Conversion . On any Alternate Conversion Date, a Holder may voluntarily convert any number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder pursuant to Section 4(c) (with Alternate Conversion Price replacing Conversion Price 
for all purposes hereunder with respect to such Alternate Conversion and with the applicable Required Premium multiplied by the
Conversion Amount replacing Conversion Amount in clause (x) of the definition of Conversion Rate in Section 4(b)
above with respect to such Alternate Conversion) by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii)
of this Certificate of Designations that such Holder is electing to use the Alternate Conversion Price for such conversion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4(f)(ii), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Company delivers to such Holder the shares
of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to the applicable Alternate Conversion of such Holder s Preferred Shares,
such Preferred Shares may be converted by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(c) without regard to this Section
4(f)(ii). In the event of an Alternate Conversion pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii) of all, or any portion, of any Preferred Shares of
a Holder, such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict
future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly,
any redemption premium due under this Section 4(f)(ii), together the Alternate Conversion Price used in such Alternate Conversion, as
applicable, is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of, such Holder s actual loss of its investment
opportunity and not as a penalty.

 Rights Upon Fundamental Transactions . 

(a)
 Assumption . The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the Successor Entity assumes in writing
all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 66 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, including
agreements to deliver to each holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for such Preferred Shares a security of the Successor Entity evidenced
by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of Designations, including, without limitation,
having a stated value and dividend rate equal to the stated value and dividend rate of the Preferred Shares held by the Holders and having
similar ranking to the Preferred Shares, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental
Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction,
the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company shall refer
instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the
Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had
been named as the Company herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor
Entity shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares at
any time after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets
or other property (except such items still issuable under Sections 7 and 15, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable
upon the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly traded common
stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) which each Holder would have been entitled to receive
upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior
to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate
of Designations), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 6 to permit the Fundamental
Transaction without the assumption of the Preferred Shares. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly and equally to successive
Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares. 

16 

(b)
 Notice of a Change of Control; Change of Control Election Notice . No sooner than the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Trading Days prior
to the consummation of a Change of Control or (y) the public announcement of the entry into an agreement with respect to a Change of
Control, nor later than ten (10) Trading Days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control (the Change of Control Date ),
the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (a Change of Control
Notice ). At any time during the period beginning after a Holder s receipt of a Change of Control Notice or such Holder
becoming aware of a Change of Control if a Change of Control Notice is not delivered to such Holder in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence (as applicable) and ending on twenty (20) Trading Days after the later of (A) the date of consummation of such Change
of Control or (B) the date of receipt of such Change of Control Notice or (C) the date of the announcement of such Change of Control,
such Holder may require, by delivering written notice thereof Change of Control Election Notice to the Company
(which Change of Control Election Notice shall indicate the number of Preferred Shares subject to such election), to have the Company
exchange such Holder s Preferred Shares designated in such Change of Control Election Notice for consideration equal to the Change
of Control Election Price (as defined below), to be satisfied at the Company s election (such election to pay in cash or by delivery
of the Rights (as defined below), a Consideration Election ), in either (I) rights (with a beneficial ownership limitation
in the form of Section 4(d) hereof, mutatis mutandis (collectively, the Rights ), convertible in whole, or
in part, at any time, without the requirement to pay any additional consideration, at the option of the Required Holders, into such Corporate
Event Consideration (as defined below) applicable to such Change of Control equal in value to the Change of Control Election Price, or
(II) in cash. The Company shall give each Holder written notice of each Consideration Election at least ten (10) Trading Days prior to
the time of consummation of such Change of Control. Payment of such amounts or delivery of the Rights, as applicable, shall be made by
the Company (or at the Company s direction) to each Holder on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Trading Day after the date of such
request and (y) the date of consummation of such Change of Control (or, with respect to any Right, if applicable, such later time that
holders of shares of Common Stock are initially entitled to receive Corporate Event Consideration with respect to the shares of Common
Stock of such holder). Any Corporate Event Consideration included in the Rights, if any, pursuant to this Section 6(b) is pari passu
 with the Corporate Event Consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Common Stock and the Company shall not permit a payment
of any Corporate Event Consideration to the holders of shares of Common Stock without on or prior to such time delivering the Right to
the Holders in accordance herewith. Cash payments, if any, required by this Section 6(b) shall have priority to payments to all other
stockholders of the Company in connection with such Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(b),
but subject to Section 4(d), until the applicable Change of Control Election Price is paid in full to the applicable Holder in cash or
Corporate Event Consideration in accordance herewith, the Preferred Shares submitted by such Holder for exchange or payment, as applicable,
under this Section 6(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 or in the event
the Conversion Date is after the consummation of such Change of Control, stock or equity interests of the Successor Entity substantially
equivalent to the Company s shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 6. In the event of the Company s repayment or exchange,
as applicable, of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 6(b), such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to
estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable
substitute investment opportunity for a Holder. Accordingly, any Required Premium due under this Section 6(b) is intended by the parties
to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in connection with any redemption hereunder at a time a Holder is entitled to receive
a cash payment under any of the other Transaction Documents, at the option of such Holder delivered in writing to the Company, the applicable
redemption price hereunder shall be increased by the amount of such cash payment owed to such Holder under such other Transaction Document
and, upon payment in full or conversion in accordance herewith, shall satisfy the Company s payment obligation under such other
Transaction Document.

issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all
or substantially all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder
will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could
have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares
(without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose
that all the Preferred Shares were converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) held by such Holder
immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record
is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such
Purchase Rights; provided, however, to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result
in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate
in such Purchase Right to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of
Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and such Purchase Right
to such extent shall be held in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision,
such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable) for the benefit of such Holder until such time or
times, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage,
at which time or times such Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase
Right or on any subsequent Purchase Right held similarly in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date
or other similar provision, such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable)) to the same extent as
if there had been no such limitation. 

18 

(b)
 Other Corporate Events . In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any
Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect
to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision to
ensure that each Holder will thereafter have the right, at such Holder s option, to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder (i) such securities or other assets (the Corporate Event Consideration to which such
Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such Holder
upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the
Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon
such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the consummation
of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder
initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion
rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate of an Alternate Conversion. Provision made pursuant the preceding sentence
shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly
and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of
the Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations. 

8.
 Rights Upon Issuance of Other Securities . 

(a)
 Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock . If and whenever on or after the Subscription Date the Company grants,
issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell), or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have granted,

the account of the Company, but excluding any Excluded Securities granted, issued or sold or deemed to have been granted, issued or sold)
for a consideration per share (the New Issuance Price less than a price equal to the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such granting, issuance or sale or deemed granting, issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect is referred
to herein as the Applicable Price (the foregoing a Dilutive Issuance ), then, immediately after
such Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price. For all purposes
of the foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under this Section
8(a)), the following shall be applicable: 

(i)
 Issuance of Options . If the Company in any manner grants, issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell)
any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such
Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and
to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting, issuance or sale of such Option for such price per share. For
purposes of this Section 8(a)(i), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon
the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any
such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of
consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance
or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon
exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for which
one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon the exercise of any such
Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof, minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Option (or any other Person) with
respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion,
exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof plus
the value of any other consideration (including, without limitation, consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or any
other property) received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person). Except as contemplated
below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such
Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof or upon the actual issuance of such
shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

19 

(ii)
 Issuance of Convertible Securities . If the Company in any manner issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to issue or sell)
any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common
Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale (or the time
of execution of such agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes
of this Section 8(a)(ii), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the
lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon the issuance
or sale (or pursuant to the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of the Convertible Security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange
of such Convertible Security or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such Convertible
Security for which one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder
of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale (or the agreement
to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Security plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable (including,
without limitation, any consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or other property) by, or benefit conferred on, the
holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price
shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities
or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of
any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 8(a),
except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issuance or sale. 

(iii)
 Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion . If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible
Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time (other than
proportional changes in conversion or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in Section 8(a) below),
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been
in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional
consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes
of this Section 8(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (including, without limitation, any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the Subscription Date) are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding
sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(a)
shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. 

20 

(iv)
 Calculation of Consideration Received . If any Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right is issued in connection
with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (as determined by the Holder, the Primary
Security , and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the Secondary Securities 
and together with the Primary Security, each a Unit ), together comprising one integrated transaction, the aggregate
consideration per share of Common Stock with respect to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be the lower of (x) the purchase price
of such Unit, (y) if such Primary Security is an Option and/or Convertible Security, the lowest price per share for which one share of
Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Primary Security in accordance with 8(a)(i) or 8(a)(ii) and
(z) the lowest VWAP of the shares of Common Stock on any Trading Day during the five (5) Trading Day period (the Adjustment
Period immediately following the public announcement of such Dilutive Issuance (for the avoidance of doubt, if such public
announcement is released prior to the opening of the Principal Market on a Trading Day, such Trading Day shall be the first Trading Day
in such five Trading Day period and if any Preferred Shares are exercised, on any given Conversion Date during any such Adjustment Period,
solely with respect to such number of Preferred Shares converted on such applicable Conversion Date, such applicable Adjustment Period
shall be deemed to have ended on, and included, the Trading Day immediately prior to such Conversion Date). If any shares of Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor
will be deemed to be the net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the
fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of
consideration received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the
five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount
of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity
as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities (as the case may be). The fair value of any consideration
other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required Holder. If such parties are
unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the Valuation Event ),
the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10 th day following
such Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holder. The determination
of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall
be borne by the Company. 

21 

(v)
 Record Date . If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive
a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale
of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution
or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). 

(b)
 Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision of Section 7 or
Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination,
recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of
shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision
of Section 7 or Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock
combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment
pursuant to this Section 8(b) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any
event requiring an adjustment under this Section 8(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then
the calculation of such Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by rounding to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100 th
 of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or
held by or for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 

(d)
 Voluntary Adjustment by Company . Subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market and Section 8(g) below, the Company
may at any time any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, with the prior written consent of the Required Holder, reduce the then current
Conversion Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board. 

(e)
 Adjustments . If on the Applicable Date (as defined in the Issuance Agreement) (the Adjustment Date ), the
Conversion Price then in effect is greater than the greater of (A) the Floor Price, and (B) the Market Price then in effect (the Adjustment
Price ), on the Adjustment Date the Conversion Price shall automatically lower to the Adjustment Price. 

22 

(f)
 Exchange Right . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates any Subsequent
Placement (other than with respect to Excluded Securities), and a Holder elects in writing to the Company to participate in such Subsequent
Placement, each such Holder may, at the option of such Holder as elected in writing to the Company, exchange all, or any part, of the
Preferred Shares of such Holder into the securities in such Subsequent Placement (with the aggregate amount of such securities to be
issued in such exchange equal to such aggregate amount of such securities with a purchase price valued at 105 of the Conversion Amount
of the Preferred Shares delivered by such Holder in exchange therefor). 

(g)
 Conversion Floor Price . Prior to the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Issuance Agreement), no adjustment pursuant
to this Section 8 shall cause the Conversion Price to be less than 2.561 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination,
reclassification or similar transaction occurring after the date of the Issuance Agreement) (the Conversion Floor Price ).
As of the Stockholder Approval Date, any Dilutive Issuances or other events that would have resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion
Price prior to the Stockholder Approval Date, but for the application of this Section 8(g), shall adjust the Conversion Price hereunder
as if such Dilutive Issuances and/or other events, as applicable, occurred on the Stockholder Approval Date. 

9.
 Redemption at the Company s Election . At any time, the Company shall have the right to redeem all, but not less than all,
of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (the Company Optional Redemption Amount on the Company Optional Redemption
Date (each as defined below) (a Company Optional Redemption ). The Preferred Shares subject to redemption pursuant
to this Section 9 shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price (the Company Optional Redemption Price equal
to the greater of (i) 110 of the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date and (ii) the product of
(1) the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date multiplied by
(2) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding
such Company Optional Redemption Notice Date and ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date the Company makes the entire
payment required to be made under this Section 9. The Company may exercise its right to require redemption under this Section 9 by delivering
a written notice thereof by electronic mail and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders (the Company
Optional Redemption Notice and the date all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date ). Such Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable; provided that the Company Optional
Redemption Notice may be conditioned upon the consummation of a refinancing transaction or a Going Private Transaction. The Company Optional
Redemption Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Optional Redemption shall occur (the Company Optional Redemption
Date which date shall not be less than ten (10) Trading Days nor more than twenty (20) Trading Days following the Company
Optional Redemption Notice Date, and (y) state the aggregate Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares which is being redeemed in such
Company Optional Redemption from such Holder and all of the other Holders of the Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 9 on the Company
Optional Redemption Date. The Company shall deliver the applicable Company Optional Redemption Price to each Holder in cash on the applicable
Company Optional Redemption Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the date the Company Optional
Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Company Optional Redemption Amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares
of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4. All Conversion Amounts converted by a Holder after the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date
shall reduce the Company Optional Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares of such Holder required to be redeemed on the Company Optional
Redemption Date. In the event of the Company s redemption of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 9, a Holder s
damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the
uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium
due under this Section 9 is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss
of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no right to effect a Company Optional
Redemption if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s
right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Going Private Transaction, the
Company may effect a Company Optional Redemption under this Section 9, but with Change of Control Election Price replacing
 Company Optional Redemption Price for all purposes in this Section 9 in connection therewith. 

23 

10.
 Noncircumvention . The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation,
bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate
of Designations, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all action
as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision
of this Certificate of Designations or the other Transaction Documents, the Company (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares
of Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all
action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting
the conversion of the Preferred Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect
the conversion of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if after the sixty (60) calendar day anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder is not permitted
to convert such Holder s Preferred Shares in full for any reason (other than pursuant to restrictions set forth in Section 4(d)
hereof), the Company shall use its best efforts to promptly remedy such failure, including, without limitation, obtaining such consents
or approvals as necessary to effect such conversion into shares of Common Stock. 

11.
 Authorized Shares . 

(a)
 Reservation . So long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company shall at all times reserve at least 200 of the number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion, including without limitation, Alternate Conversions,
of all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding at the Alternate Conversion Price then in effect (without regard to any limitations on
conversions) (the Required Reserve Amount ). The Required Reserve Amount (including, without limitation, each increase
in the number of shares so reserved) shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of the Preferred Shares held by
each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the Authorized Share
Allocation ). In the event that a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder s Preferred Shares, each
transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder s Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved
and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders of Preferred Shares,
pro rata based on the number of the Preferred Shares then held by the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may allocate its
Authorized Share Allocation to any other of the securities of the Company held by such Holder (or any of its designees) by delivery of
a written notice to the Company. 

(b)
 Insufficient Authorized Shares . If, notwithstanding Section 11(a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while any of the
Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock
to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall immediately take all
action necessary to increase the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve
the Required Reserve Amount for the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as
soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after
the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase
in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with
a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of
Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal (or, if a majority
of the voting power then in effect of the capital stock of the Company consents to such increase, in lieu of such proxy statement, deliver
to the stockholders of the Company an information statement that has been filed with (and either approved by or not subject to comments
from) the SEC with respect thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any such time of an Authorized Share Failure, the Company is
able to obtain the written consent of a majority of the shares of its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock to approve the increase
in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, the Company may satisfy this obligation by obtaining such consent and submitting
for filing with the SEC an Information Statement on Schedule 14C. Nothing contained in Section 11(a) or this Section 11(b) shall limit
any obligations of the Company under any provision of the Issuance Agreement or Registration Rights Agreement. 

24 

12.
 Voting Rights . The holders of the Preferred Shares shall have no voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time,
either as a separate series or class or together with any other series or class of share of capital stock, and shall not be entitled
to call a meeting of such holders for any purpose nor shall they be entitled to participate in any meeting of the holders of Common Stock,
except as provided in this Section 12 and Section 16 or as otherwise required by the DGCL. To the extent that under the DGCL the vote
of the holders of the Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given action
of the Company, the affirmative vote or consent of the Required Holders of the Preferred Shares, voting together in the aggregate and
not in separate series unless required under the DGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is presented or by written
consent of the Required Holders (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate
series unless required under the DGCL, shall constitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable. Holders
of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to written notice of all stockholder meetings or written consents (and copies of proxy materials
and other information sent to stockholders) with respect to which they would be entitled to vote, which notice would be provided pursuant
to the Company s bylaws (the Bylaws and the DGCL.

ordinary course of business in a manner and to an extent consistent with past practice and necessary or desirable for the prudent operation

(i) issue any Preferred Shares (other than as contemplated by the Issuance Agreement and this Certificate of Designations and the acquisition

Investigator ). If the Independent Investigator determines that such breach of this Certificate of Designations has occurred,
the Independent Investigator shall notify the Company of such breach and the Company shall deliver written notice to each Holder of such
breach. In connection with such investigation, the Independent Investigator may, during normal business hours, inspect all contracts,
books, records, personnel, offices and other facilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the extent available
to the Company after the Company uses reasonable efforts to obtain them, the records of its legal advisors and accountants and any books
of account, records, reports and other papers not contractually required of the Company to be confidential or secret, or subject to attorney-client

the date of such payment and (B) the amount per share such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Share into Common
Stock immediately prior to the date of such payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due
to the Holders and holders of shares of Parity Stock, then each Holder and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of

Funds payable to all holders of Preferred Shares and all holders of shares of Parity Stock. To the extent necessary, the Company shall

by way of return of capital or otherwise (including without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property
or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction)

if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Preferred Shares (without taking
into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that the Preferred
Share was converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) immediately prior to the date on which a record
is taken for such Distribution or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined
for such Distributions provided , however , that to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such
Distribution would result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not
be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and the
portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would
not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times, if any, such Holder
shall be granted such Distribution (and any Distributions declared or made on such initial Distribution or on any subsequent Distribution

hereby or pursuant to the Issuance Agreement; or (g) without limiting any provision of Section 14, whether or not prohibited by the terms
of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares hereunder. 

17.
 Transfer of Preferred Shares . A Holder may offer, sell or transfer some or all of its Preferred Shares without the consent of
the Company subject only to the provisions of Section 5 of the Issuance Agreement. 

18.
 Reissuance of Preferred Share Certificates and Book Entries . 

(a)
 Transfer . If any Preferred Shares are to be transferred, the applicable Holder shall surrender the applicable Preferred Share
Certificate to the Company (or, if the Preferred Shares are held in Book-Entry form, a written instruction letter to the Company), whereupon
the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section

Preferred Shares being transferred by such Holder and, if less than the entire outstanding number of Preferred Shares is being transferred,
a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to such Holder representing the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares not being transferred (or evidence of such remaining Preferred Shares in a Book-Entry for such Holder). Such Holder and any assignee,
by acceptance of the Preferred Share Certificate or evidence of Book-Entry issuance, as applicable, acknowledge and agree that, by reason
of the provisions of Section 4(c)(i) following conversion or redemption of any of the Preferred Shares, the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares represented by the Preferred Shares may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face of the Preferred Shares. 

28 

(b)
 Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Preferred Share Certificate . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Preferred Share Certificate (as to which a written certification and the indemnification
contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking
by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of such Preferred Share Certificate, the Company shall execute and deliver to such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance
with Section 18(d)) representing the applicable outstanding number of Preferred Shares. 

(c)
 Preferred Share Certificate and Book-Entries Exchangeable for Different Denominations and Forms . Each Preferred Share Certificate

outstanding number of the Preferred Shares in the original Preferred Share Certificate, and each such new Preferred Share Certificate
and/or new Book-Entry, as applicable, will represent such portion of such outstanding number of Preferred Shares from the original Preferred
Share Certificate as is designated in writing by such Holder at the time of such surrender. Each Book-Entry may be exchanged into one
or more new Preferred Share Certificates or split by the applicable Holder by delivery of a written notice to the Company into two or
more new Book-Entries (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing, in the aggregate, the outstanding number of the Preferred Shares
in the original Book-Entry, and each such new Book-Entry and/or new Preferred Share Certificate, as applicable, will represent such portion
of such outstanding number of Preferred Shares from the original Book-Entry as is designated in writing by such Holder at the time of
such surrender. 

(d)
 Issuance of New Preferred Share Certificate or Book-Entry . Whenever the Company is required to issue a new Preferred Share Certificate
or a new Book-Entry pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations, such new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry

Preferred Shares remaining outstanding (or in the case of a new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry being issued pursuant to
Section 18(a) or Section 18(c), the number of Preferred Shares designated by such Holder) which, when added to the number of Preferred
Shares represented by the other new Preferred Share Certificates or other new Book-Entry, as applicable, issued in connection with such
issuance, does not exceed the number of Preferred Shares remaining outstanding under the original Preferred Share Certificate or original
Book-Entry, as applicable, immediately prior to such issuance of new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry, as applicable, and
(ii) shall have an issuance date, as indicated on the face of such new Preferred Share Certificate or in such new Book-Entry, as applicable,
which is the same as the issuance date of the original Preferred Share Certificate or in such original Book-Entry, as applicable. 

29 

19.
 Remedies, Characterizations, Other Obligations, Breaches and Injunctive Relief. The remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations
shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations and any of the other Transaction
Documents, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall
limit any Holder s right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of
this Certificate of Designations. No failure on the part of a Holder to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by such Holder of any right, power or remedy preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In addition, the exercise of any right or
remedy of a Holder at law or equity or under this Certificate of Designations or any of the documents shall not be deemed to be an election
of such Holder s rights or remedies under such documents or at law or equity. The Company covenants to each Holder that there shall
be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with
respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by a Holder and shall
not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). No failure
on the part of a Holder to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise by such Holder of any right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In addition, the exercise of any right or remedy of any Holder at law or equity
or under Preferred Shares or any of the documents shall not be deemed to be an election of such Holder s rights or remedies under
such documents or at law or equity. The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable

terms hereof. 

(iii)

(including by electronic-mail) to the Company, elect to receive such Preferred Shares in the form of one or more Preferred Share Certificates

Share for all purposes (including, without limitation, the right to receive payments and Dividends hereunder) notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. A Registered Preferred Share may be assigned, transferred or sold only by registration of such assignment or sale on
the Register. Upon its receipt of a written request to assign, transfer or sell one or more Registered Preferred Shares by such Holder

such Registered Preferred Shares within two (2) Business Days of such a request, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated
to reflect such assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
 4, following conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the applicable Holder shall not be required
to physically surrender such Preferred Shares held in the form of a Preferred Share Certificate to the Company unless (A) the full or
remaining number of Preferred Shares represented by the applicable Preferred Share Certificate are being converted (in which event such
certificate(s) shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(iii)) or (B) such Holder has provided the
Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon

Value and Dividends converted and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be)
or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of a
Preferred Share Certificate upon conversion. If the Company does not update the Register to record such Stated Value and Dividends converted
and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) within two (2) Business Days
of such occurrence, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to reflect such occurrence. In the event of any dispute or
discrepancy, the records of the Company establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling
and determinative in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge
and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred
Shares represented by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each Preferred Share

(v)
 Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes . In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same
Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert
from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted
for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to
the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of Conversion
Shares issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of
Conversion Shares not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. If a Conversion Notice delivered to the
Company would result in a breach of Section 4(d) below, and the applicable Holder does not elect in writing to withdraw, in whole,
such Conversion Notice, the Company shall hold such Conversion Notice in abeyance until such time as such Conversion Notice may be satisfied
without violating Section 4(d) below (with such calculations thereunder made as of the date such Conversion Notice was initially
delivered to the Company). 

(d)
 Limitation on Beneficial Ownership . The Company shall not effect the conversion of any of the Preferred Shares held by a Holder,
and such Holder shall not have the right to convert any of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Certificate of Designations and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after
giving effect to such conversion, such Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess
of 4.99 (the Maximum Percentage of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder
and the other Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties
 plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination
of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining,
nonconverted Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion
of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes,
convertible preferred stock or warrants, including the Preferred Shares) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other Attribution Party
subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 4(d). For purposes of this
Section 4(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. For the avoidance of doubt,
the calculation of the Maximum Percentage shall take into account the concurrent exercise and/or conversion, as applicable, of the unexercised
or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such Holder and/or any other Attribution Party, as
applicable. For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion of
such Preferred Shares without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
as reflected in (x) the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form
8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other written
notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent, if any, setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the Reported
Outstanding Share Number ). If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify such Holder in writing of the number
of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause such Holder s beneficial
ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(d), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify the Company of
a reduced number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice. For any reason at any time, upon the written
or oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including such Preferred Shares, by such Holder
and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that the
issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of such Preferred Shares results in such Holder and the other Attribution
Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such Holder s and the other
Attribution Parties aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the Excess Shares shall
be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess
Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective
until the sixty-first (61 st day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other
percentage not in excess of 9.99 as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not
be effective until the sixty-first (61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or
decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an Attribution Party
of such Holder. For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of
Designations in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Holder for any purpose including
for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to this
paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination
of convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity
with the terms of this Section 4(d) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may
be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 4(d) or to make changes
or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitation contained in this paragraph may not
be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of such Preferred Shares.

(e)
 Mandatory Conversion . 

(i)
 General . If at any time (i) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal Market equals at least 300 of
the Conversion Price for twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days (each, a Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period ), and
(ii) no Equity Conditions Failure then exists, the Company shall have the right to require each Holder to convert all, or any number,
of the Preferred Shares, as designated in the Mandatory Conversion Notice (as defined below) into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof at the Conversion Rate as of the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined
below) (a Mandatory Conversion ). The Company may exercise its right to require conversion under this Section 4(e)
by delivering within five (5) Trading Days following the end of such Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period a written notice thereof by
electronic mail and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders and the Transfer Agent (the Mandatory Conversion
Notice and the date all of the Holders received such notice by electronic mail is referred to as the Mandatory Conversion
Notice Date ). The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable. The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall state (i) the Trading
Day selected for the Mandatory Conversion in accordance with this Section 4(e), which Trading Day shall be no less than two (2)
Trading Days and no more than fifteen (15) Trading Days following the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date (the Mandatory Conversion
Date ), (ii) the aggregate number of the Preferred Shares subject to mandatory conversion from each Holder pursuant to this
Section 4(e), (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to such Holder on the Mandatory Conversion Date and (iv) that
there has been no Equity Conditions Failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may effect only one (1) Mandatory Conversion
during any twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if the Closing Sale Price of the
Common Stock listed on the Principal Market fails to exceed the Conversion Price by 300 for each Trading Day commencing on the Mandatory
Conversion Notice Date and ending and including the Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date (a Mandatory
Conversion Price Failure or an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, (A) the
Company shall provide each Holder a subsequent notice to that effect and (B) unless such Holder waives the applicable Equity Conditions
Failure and/or Mandatory Conversion Price Failure, as applicable, the Mandatory Conversion shall be cancelled and the applicable Mandatory
Conversion Notice of such Holder shall be null and void and (ii) at any time prior to the date of consummation of the Mandatory Conversion
the Preferred Shares subject to such Mandatory Conversion may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common
Stock pursuant to Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Preferred Shares subject to a Mandatory Conversion may be converted
by a Holder hereunder prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date and such aggregate number of Preferred Shares converted hereunder
on or after the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date and prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date shall reduce the aggregate number of Preferred
Shares of such Holder required to be converted on such Mandatory Conversion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have
no right to effect a Mandatory Conversion if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no
effect upon any Holder s right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. 

7 

(ii)
 Pro Rata Conversion Requirement . If the Company elects to cause a Mandatory Conversion of any Preferred Shares pursuant to this
Section 4(e), then it must simultaneously take the same action in the same proportion with respect to all Holders of Preferred Shares. 

(f)
 Right of Alternate Conversion Upon a Triggering Event . 

(i)
 General . Subject to Section 4(d), at any time after the later of (A) the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Series
F Certificate of Designations) and (B) the earlier of a Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice (as defined below) and such
Holder becoming aware of a Triggering Event (such earlier date, the Alternate Conversion Right Commencement Date and ending (such ending date, the Alternate Conversion Right Expiration Date , and each such period, an Alternate
Conversion Right Period on the twentieth (20 th Trading Day after the later of (x) the date such Triggering Event
is cured and (y) such Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice that includes (I) a reasonable description of the applicable
Triggering Event, (II) a certification as to whether, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, such Triggering Event is capable of being
cured and, if applicable, a reasonable description of any existing plans of the Company to cure such Triggering Event and (III) a certification
as to the date the Triggering Event occurred and, if cured on or prior to the date of such Triggering Event Notice, the applicable Alternate
Conversion Right Expiration Date, such Holder may, at such Holder s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice to the Company (the
date of any such Conversion Notice, each an Alternate Conversion Date ), convert all, or any number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder into shares of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, an Alternate Conversion ). 

(ii)
 Mechanics of Alternate Conversion . On any Alternate Conversion Date, a Holder may voluntarily convert any number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder pursuant to Section 4(c) (with Alternate Conversion Price replacing Conversion Price 
for all purposes hereunder with respect to such Alternate Conversion and with the applicable Required Premium multiplied by the
Conversion Amount replacing Conversion Amount in clause (x) of the definition of Conversion Rate in Section 4(b)
above with respect to such Alternate Conversion) by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii)
of this Certificate of Designations that such Holder is electing to use the Alternate Conversion Price for such conversion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4(f)(ii), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Company delivers to such Holder the
shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to the applicable Alternate Conversion of such Holder s Preferred
Shares, such Preferred Shares may be converted by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(c) without regard
to this Section 4(f)(ii). In the event of an Alternate Conversion pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii) of all, or any portion,
of any Preferred Shares of a Holder, such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties 
inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for
such Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium due under this Section 4(f)(ii), together the Alternate Conversion Price used in
such Alternate Conversion, as applicable, is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of, such Holder s
actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.

 Rights Upon Fundamental Transactions . 

(a)
 Assumption . The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the Successor Entity assumes in writing
all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 6 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders,
including agreements to deliver to each holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for such Preferred Shares a security of the Successor
Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of Designations, including,
without limitation, having a stated value and dividend rate equal to the stated value and dividend rate of the Preferred Shares held
by the Holders and having similar ranking to the Preferred Shares, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Upon the occurrence
of any Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such
Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company 
shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations
of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity
had been named as the Company herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor
Entity shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares at
any time after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets
or other property (except such items still issuable under Sections 7 and 15, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter))
issuable upon the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly
traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) which each Holder would have been entitled
to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately
prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this
Certificate of Designations), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 6 to permit
the Fundamental Transaction without the assumption of the Preferred Shares. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly
and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption
of the Preferred Shares. 

12 

(b)
 Notice of a Change of Control; Change of Control Election Notice . No sooner than the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Trading Days prior
to the consummation of a Change of Control or (y) the public announcement of the entry into an agreement with respect to a Change of
Control, nor later than ten (10) Trading Days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control (the Change of Control Date ),
the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (a Change of Control
Notice ). At any time during the period beginning after a Holder s receipt of a Change of Control Notice or such Holder
becoming aware of a Change of Control if a Change of Control Notice is not delivered to such Holder in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence (as applicable) and ending on twenty (20) Trading Days after the later of (A) the date of consummation of such Change
of Control or (B) the date of receipt of such Change of Control Notice or (C) the date of the announcement of such Change of Control,
such Holder may require, by delivering written notice thereof Change of Control Election Notice to the Company
(which Change of Control Election Notice shall indicate the number of Preferred Shares subject to such election), to have the Company
exchange such Holder s Preferred Shares designated in such Change of Control Election Notice for consideration equal to the Change
of Control Election Price (as defined below), to be satisfied at the Company s election (such election to pay in cash or by delivery
of the Rights (as defined below), a Consideration Election ), in either (I) rights (with a beneficial ownership limitation
in the form of Section 4(d) hereof, mutatis mutandis (collectively, the Rights ), convertible in whole,
or in part, at any time, without the requirement to pay any additional consideration, at the option of the Required Holders, into such
Corporate Event Consideration (as defined below) applicable to such Change of Control equal in value to the Change of Control Election
Price, or (II) in cash. The Company shall give each Holder written notice of each Consideration Election at least ten (10) Trading Days
prior to the time of consummation of such Change of Control. Payment of such amounts or delivery of the Rights, as applicable, shall
be made by the Company (or at the Company s direction) to each Holder on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Trading Day after the
date of such request and (y) the date of consummation of such Change of Control (or, with respect to any Right, if applicable, such later
time that holders of shares of Common Stock are initially entitled to receive Corporate Event Consideration with respect to the shares
of Common Stock of such holder). Any Corporate Event Consideration included in the Rights, if any, pursuant to this Section 6(b)
is pari passu with the Corporate Event Consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Common Stock and the Company shall not
permit a payment of any Corporate Event Consideration to the holders of shares of Common Stock without on or prior to such time delivering
the Right to the Holders in accordance herewith. Cash payments, if any, required by this Section 6 (b) shall have priority to
payments to all other stockholders of the Company in connection with such Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 6 (b), but subject to Section 4(d), until the applicable Change of Control Election Price is paid in full
to the applicable Holder in cash or Corporate Event Consideration in accordance herewith, the Preferred Shares submitted by such Holder
for exchange or payment, as applicable, under this Section 6 (b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such Holder into
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 or in the event the Conversion Date is after the consummation of such Change of Control, stock
or equity interests of the Successor Entity substantially equivalent to the Company s shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section
 6. In the event of the Company s repayment or exchange, as applicable, of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 6 (b),
such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest
rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for a Holder. Accordingly, any Required
Premium due under this Section 6 (b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s
actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in connection with any
redemption hereunder at a time a Holder is entitled to receive a cash payment under any of the other Transaction Documents, at the option
of such Holder delivered in writing to the Company, the applicable redemption price hereunder shall be increased by the amount of such
cash payment owed to such Holder under such other Transaction Document and, upon payment in full or conversion in accordance herewith,
shall satisfy the Company s payment obligation under such other Transaction Document. 

7.
 Rights Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events . 

(a)
 Purchase Rights . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 8 and Section 15 below, if at any time the Company
grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata
to all or substantially all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each
Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder
could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred
Shares (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such
purpose that all the Preferred Shares were converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) held by such
Holder immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such
record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale
of such Purchase Rights; provided, however, to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would
result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate
in such Purchase Right to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of
Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and such Purchase Right
to such extent shall be held in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision,
such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable) for the benefit of such Holder until such time or
times, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage,
at which time or times such Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase
Right or on any subsequent Purchase Right held similarly in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date
or other similar provision, such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable)) to the same extent as
if there had been no such limitation. 

13 

(b)
 Other Corporate Events . In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any
Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect
to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision to
ensure that each Holder will thereafter have the right, at such Holder s option, to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder (i) such securities or other assets (the Corporate Event Consideration to which such
Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such Holder
upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the
Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon
such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the consummation
of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder
initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion
rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate of an Alternate Conversion. Provision made pursuant the preceding sentence
shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly
and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of
the Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations. 

8.
 Rights Upon Issuance of Other Securities . 

(a)
 Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock . If and whenever on or after the Subscription Date the Company grants,
issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell), or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have
granted, issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the granting, issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held
by or for the account of the Company, but excluding any Excluded Securities granted, issued or sold or deemed to have been granted, issued
or sold) for a consideration per share (the New Issuance Price less than a price equal to the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such granting, issuance or sale or deemed granting, issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect
is referred to herein as the Applicable Price (the foregoing a Dilutive Issuance ), then, immediately
after such Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price. For
all purposes of the foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under
this Section 8(a)), the following shall be applicable: 

(i)
 Issuance of Options . If the Company in any manner grants, issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell)
any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such
Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and
to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting, issuance or sale of such Option for such price per share. For
purposes of this Section 8(a)(i), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable
upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of
any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts
of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance
or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon
exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for which
one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon the exercise of any such
Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof, minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Option (or any other Person) with
respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion,
exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof plus
the value of any other consideration (including, without limitation, consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or any
other property) received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person). Except as contemplated
below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such
Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof or upon the actual issuance of such
shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

14 

(ii)
 Issuance of Convertible Securities . If the Company in any manner issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to issue or sell)
any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common
Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale (or the time
of execution of such agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes
of this Section 8(a)(ii), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the
conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the
sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon
the issuance or sale (or pursuant to the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of the Convertible Security and upon conversion,
exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set
forth in such Convertible Security for which one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market
conditions) upon conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts
paid or payable to the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the
issuance or sale (or the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Security plus the value of any other consideration
received or receivable (including, without limitation, any consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or other property)
by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further
adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of such Convertible Securities or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible
Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other
provisions of this Section 8(a), except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason
of such issuance or sale. 

(iii)
 Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion . If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible
Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time (other than
proportional changes in conversion or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in Section 8(a) below),
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been
in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional
consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes
of this Section 8(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (including, without limitation, any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the Subscription Date) are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding
sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(a)
shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. 

15 

(iv)
 Calculation of Consideration Received . If any Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right is issued in connection
with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (as determined by the Holder, the Primary
Security , and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the Secondary Securities 
and together with the Primary Security, each a Unit ), together comprising one integrated transaction, the aggregate
consideration per share of Common Stock with respect to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be the lower of (x) the purchase price
of such Unit, (y) if such Primary Security is an Option and/or Convertible Security, the lowest price per share for which one share of
Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Primary Security in accordance with 8(a)(i) or 8(a)(ii)
and (z) the lowest VWAP of the shares of Common Stock on any Trading Day during the five (5) Trading Day period (the Adjustment
Period immediately following the public announcement of such Dilutive Issuance (for the avoidance of doubt, if such public
announcement is released prior to the opening of the Principal Market on a Trading Day, such Trading Day shall be the first Trading Day
in such five Trading Day period and if any Preferred Shares are exercised, on any given Conversion Date during any such Adjustment Period,
solely with respect to such number of Preferred Shares converted on such applicable Conversion Date, such applicable Adjustment Period
shall be deemed to have ended on, and included, the Trading Day immediately prior to such Conversion Date). If any shares of Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor
will be deemed to be the net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the
fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of
consideration received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the
five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount
of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity
as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities (as the case may be). The fair value of any consideration
other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required Holder. If such parties are
unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the Valuation Event ),
the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10 th day following
such Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holder. The determination
of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall
be borne by the Company. 

(v)
 Record Date . If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive
a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale
of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution
or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). 

16 

(b)
 Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision of Section 7
or Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock
combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater
number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting
any provision of Section 7 or Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by any stock
split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares
of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(b) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision
or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment under this Section 8(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is
calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by rounding to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100 th
 of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or
held by or for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 

(d)
 Voluntary Adjustment by Company . Subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market and Section 8(g) below, the Company
may at any time any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, with the prior written consent of the Required Holder, reduce the then current
Conversion Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board. 

(e)
 Adjustments . If on the Applicable Date (as defined in the Series F Certificate of Designations) (the Adjustment Date ),
the Conversion Price then in effect is greater than the greater of (A) the Floor Price, and (B) the Market Price then in effect (the
 Adjustment Price ), on the Adjustment Date the Conversion Price shall automatically lower to the Adjustment Price. 

(f)
 Exchange Right . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates any Subsequent
Placement (other than with respect to Excluded Securities), and a Holder elects in writing to the Company to participate in such Subsequent
Placement, each such Holder may, at the option of such Holder as elected in writing to the Company, exchange all, or any part, of the
Preferred Shares of such Holder into the securities in such Subsequent Placement (with the aggregate amount of such securities to be
issued in such exchange equal to such aggregate amount of such securities with a purchase price valued at 105 of the Conversion Amount
of the Preferred Shares delivered by such Holder in exchange therefor). 

17 

(g)
 Conversion Floor Price . Prior to the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Series F Certificate of Designations), no adjustment
pursuant to this Section 8 shall cause the Conversion Price to be less than 3.641 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split,
stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction occurring after the date of the Issuance Agreement) (the Conversion
Floor Price ). As of the Stockholder Approval Date, any Dilutive Issuances or other events that would have resulted in an adjustment
to the Conversion Price prior to the Stockholder Approval Date, but for the application of this Section 8(g), shall adjust the Conversion
Price hereunder as if such Dilutive Issuances and/or other events, as applicable, occurred on the Stockholder Approval Date. 

9.
 Redemption at the Company s Election . At any time, the Company shall have the right to redeem all, but not less than all,
of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (the Company Optional Redemption Amount on the Company Optional Redemption
Date (each as defined below) (a Company Optional Redemption ). The Preferred Shares subject to redemption pursuant
to this Section 9 shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price (the Company Optional Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 110 of the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date and (ii) the product
of (1) the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date multiplied
by (2) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding
such Company Optional Redemption Notice Date and ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date the Company makes the entire
payment required to be made under this Section 9. The Company may exercise its right to require redemption under this Section 9
by delivering a written notice thereof by electronic mail and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders (the Company
Optional Redemption Notice and the date all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date ). Such Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable; provided that the Company Optional
Redemption Notice may be conditioned upon the consummation of a refinancing transaction or a Going Private Transaction. The Company Optional
Redemption Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Optional Redemption shall occur (the Company Optional Redemption
Date which date shall not be less than ten (10) Trading Days nor more than twenty (20) Trading Days following the Company
Optional Redemption Notice Date, and (y) state the aggregate Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares which is being redeemed in such
Company Optional Redemption from such Holder and all of the other Holders of the Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 9 on
the Company Optional Redemption Date. The Company shall deliver the applicable Company Optional Redemption Price to each Holder in cash
on the applicable Company Optional Redemption Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the date the
Company Optional Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Company Optional Redemption Amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by
any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4. All Conversion Amounts converted by a Holder after the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date shall reduce the Company Optional Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares of such Holder required to be redeemed
on the Company Optional Redemption Date. In the event of the Company s redemption of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section
 9, a Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future
interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly,
any redemption premium due under this Section 9 is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of
such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have
no right to effect a Company Optional Redemption if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall
have no effect upon any Holder s right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to a Going Private Transaction, the Company may effect a Company Optional Redemption under this Section 9, but with Change
of Control Election Price replacing Company Optional Redemption Price for all purposes in this Section 9 in
connection therewith. 

18 

10.
 Noncircumvention . The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation,
bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate
of Designations, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all action
as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision
of this Certificate of Designations or the other Transaction Documents, the Company (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares
of Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all
action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting
the conversion of the Preferred Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect
the conversion of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if after the sixty (60) calendar day anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder is not permitted
to convert such Holder s Preferred Shares in full for any reason (other than pursuant to restrictions set forth in Section 4(d)
hereof), the Company shall use its best efforts to promptly remedy such failure, including, without limitation, obtaining such consents
or approvals as necessary to effect such conversion into shares of Common Stock. 

11.
 Authorized Shares . 

(a)
 Reservation . So long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company shall at all times reserve at least 200 of the number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion, including without limitation, Alternate Conversions,
of all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding at the Alternate Conversion Price then in effect (without regard to any limitations on
conversions) (the Required Reserve Amount ). The Required Reserve Amount (including, without limitation, each increase
in the number of shares so reserved) shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of the Preferred Shares held by
each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the Authorized Share
Allocation ). In the event that a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder s Preferred Shares, each
transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder s Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved
and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders of Preferred Shares,
pro rata based on the number of the Preferred Shares then held by the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may allocate its
Authorized Share Allocation to any other of the securities of the Company held by such Holder (or any of its designees) by delivery of
a written notice to the Company. 

(b)
 Insufficient Authorized Shares . If, notwithstanding Section 11 (a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while
any of the Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common
Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall immediately take
all action necessary to increase the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to
reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after
the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase
in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with
a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of
Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal (or, if a majority
of the voting power then in effect of the capital stock of the Company consents to such increase, in lieu of such proxy statement, deliver
to the stockholders of the Company an information statement that has been filed with (and either approved by or not subject to comments
from) the SEC with respect thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any such time of an Authorized Share Failure, the Company is
able to obtain the written consent of a majority of the shares of its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock to approve the increase
in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, the Company may satisfy this obligation by obtaining such consent and submitting
for filing with the SEC an Information Statement on Schedule 14C. Nothing contained in Section 11 (a) or this Section 11(b)
shall limit any obligations of the Company under any provision of the Issuance Agreement. 

12.
 Voting Rights . The holders of the Preferred Shares shall have no voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time,
either as a separate series or class or together with any other series or class of share of capital stock, and shall not be entitled
to call a meeting of such holders for any purpose nor shall they be entitled to participate in any meeting of the holders of Common Stock,
except as provided in this Section 12 and Section 16 or as otherwise required by the DGCL. To the extent that under the DGCL
the vote of the holders of the Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given
action of the Company, the affirmative vote or consent of the Required Holders of the Preferred Shares, voting together in the aggregate
and not in separate series unless required under the DGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is presented or by written
consent of the Required Holders (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate
series unless required under the DGCL, shall constitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable. Holders
of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to written notice of all stockholder meetings or written consents (and copies of proxy materials
and other information sent to stockholders) with respect to which they would be entitled to vote, which notice would be provided pursuant
to the Company s bylaws (the Bylaws and the DGCL.

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

(d)

ordinary course of business in a manner and to an extent consistent with past practice and necessary or desirable for the prudent operation

(g)
 Independent Investigation . At the request of the Required Holders either (x) at any time when a Triggering Event has occurred
and is continuing, (y) upon the occurrence of an event that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute a Triggering

the Independent Investigator shall notify the Company of such breach and the Company shall deliver written notice to each Holder of such
breach. In connection with such investigation, the Independent Investigator may, during normal business hours, inspect all contracts,
books, records, personnel, offices and other facilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the extent available
to the Company after the Company uses reasonable efforts to obtain them, the records of its legal advisors and accountants and any books
of account, records, reports and other papers not contractually required of the Company to be confidential or secret, or subject to attorney-client
or other evidentiary privilege, and the Independent Investigator may make such copies and inspections thereof as the Independent Investigator

permit the Independent Investigator to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Company with, and to make proposals and furnish
advice with respect thereto to, the Company s officers, directors, key employees and independent public accountants or any of them
(and by this provision the Company authorizes said accountants to discuss with such Independent Investigator the finances and affairs
of the Company and any Subsidiaries), all at such reasonable times, upon reasonable notice, and as often as may be reasonably requested. 

14.

Funds ), before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of shares of Junior Stock, but pari passu with any Parity Stock
then outstanding, an amount per Preferred Share equal to the greater of (A) 110 of the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Share on
the date of such payment and (B) the amount per share such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Share into Common
Stock immediately prior to the date of such payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due
to the Holders and holders of shares of Parity Stock, then each Holder and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of
the Liquidation Funds equal to the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to such Holder and such holder of Parity Stock as a liquidation
preference, in accordance with their respective certificate of designations (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation
Funds payable to all holders of Preferred Shares and all holders of shares of Parity Stock. To the extent necessary, the Company shall

Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property
or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction)
(the Distributions ), then each Holder, as holders of Preferred Shares, will be entitled to such Distributions as
if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Preferred Shares (without taking
into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that the Preferred
Share was converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) immediately prior to the date on which a record
is taken for such Distribution or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined
for such Distributions provided , however , that to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such
Distribution would result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not
be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and the
portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would
not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times, if any, such Holder
shall be granted such Distribution (and any Distributions declared or made on such initial Distribution or on any subsequent Distribution
held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).

contemplated hereby or pursuant to the Issuance Agreement; or (g) without limiting any provision of Section 14, whether or not prohibited
by the terms of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares hereunder.

17.
 Transfer of Preferred Shares . A Holder may offer, sell or transfer some or all of its Preferred Shares without the consent of
the Company subject only to the provisions of Section 4(a) above. 

18.
 Reissuance of Preferred Share Certificates and Book Entries . 

(a)
 Transfer . If any Preferred Shares are to be transferred, the applicable Holder shall surrender the applicable Preferred Share
Certificate to the Company (or, if the Preferred Shares are held in Book-Entry form, a written instruction letter to the Company), whereupon
the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section
 18(d)) (or evidence of the transfer of such Book-Entry), registered as such Holder may request, representing the outstanding number
of Preferred Shares being transferred by such Holder and, if less than the entire outstanding number of Preferred Shares is being transferred,
a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to such Holder representing the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares not being transferred (or evidence of such remaining Preferred Shares in a Book-Entry for such Holder). Such Holder and any assignee,
by acceptance of the Preferred Share Certificate or evidence of Book-Entry issuance, as applicable, acknowledge and agree that, by reason
of the provisions of Section 4(c)(i) following conversion or redemption of any of the Preferred Shares, the outstanding number of
Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Shares may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face of the Preferred
Shares. 

(b)
 Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Preferred Share Certificate . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Preferred Share Certificate (as to which a written certification and the indemnification
contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking
by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of such Preferred Share Certificate, the Company shall execute and deliver to such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance
with Section 18(d)) representing the applicable outstanding number of Preferred Shares. 

(c)
 Preferred Share Certificate and Book-Entries Exchangeable for Different Denominations and Forms . Each Preferred Share Certificate

the outstanding number of the Preferred Shares in the original Preferred Share Certificate, and each such new Preferred Share Certificate
and/or new Book-Entry, as applicable, will represent such portion of such outstanding number of Preferred Shares from the original Preferred
Share Certificate as is designated in writing by such Holder at the time of such surrender. Each Book-Entry may be exchanged into one
or more new Preferred Share Certificates or split by the applicable Holder by delivery of a written notice to the Company into two or
more new Book-Entries (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing, in the aggregate, the outstanding number of the Preferred
Shares in the original Book-Entry, and each such new Book-Entry and/or new Preferred Share Certificate, as applicable, will represent
such portion of such outstanding number of Preferred Shares from the original Book-Entry as is designated in writing by such Holder at
the time of such surrender. 

(d)
 Issuance of New Preferred Share Certificate or Book-Entry . Whenever the Company is required to issue a new Preferred Share Certificate
or a new Book-Entry pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations, such new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry
(i) shall represent, as indicated on the face of such Preferred Share Certificate or in such Book-Entry, as applicable, the number of

hereunder (as the case may be) (and to issue such Conversion Shares) shall terminate, or (II) promptly honor its obligation to so issue

Company and each Holder of the Preferred Shares shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Preferred
Share for all purposes (including, without limitation, the right to receive payments and Dividends hereunder) notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. A Registered Preferred Share may be assigned, transferred or sold only by registration of such assignment or sale on
the Register. Upon its receipt of a written request to assign, transfer or sell one or more Registered Preferred Shares by such Holder
thereof, the Company shall record the information contained therein in the Register and issue one or more new Registered Preferred Shares
in the same aggregate Stated Value as the Stated Value of the surrendered Registered Preferred Shares to the designated assignee or transferee
pursuant to Section 18, provided that if the Company does not so record an assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be) of
such Registered Preferred Shares within two (2) Business Days of such a request, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated
to reflect such assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
 4, following conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the applicable Holder shall not be required
to physically surrender such Preferred Shares held in the form of a Preferred Share Certificate to the Company unless (A) the full or
remaining number of Preferred Shares represented by the applicable Preferred Share Certificate are being converted (in which event such
certificate(s) shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(iii)) or (B) such Holder has provided the
Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon
physical surrender of the applicable Preferred Share Certificate. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Stated
Value and Dividends converted and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be)
or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of a
Preferred Share Certificate upon conversion. If the Company does not update the Register to record such Stated Value and Dividends converted
and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) within two (2) Business Days
of such occurrence, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to reflect such occurrence. In the event of any dispute or
discrepancy, the records of the Company establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling
and determinative in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge
and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred
Shares represented by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each Preferred Share

(v)
 Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes . In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same
Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert
from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted
for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to
the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of Conversion
Shares issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of
Conversion Shares not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. If a Conversion Notice delivered to the
Company would result in a breach of Section 4(d) below, and the applicable Holder does not elect in writing to withdraw, in whole,
such Conversion Notice, the Company shall hold such Conversion Notice in abeyance until such time as such Conversion Notice may be satisfied
without violating Section 4(d) below (with such calculations thereunder made as of the date such Conversion Notice was initially
delivered to the Company). 

(d)
 Limitation on Beneficial Ownership . The Company shall not effect the conversion of any of the Preferred Shares held by a Holder,
and such Holder shall not have the right to convert any of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Certificate of Designations and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after
giving effect to such conversion, such Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess
of 4.99 (the Maximum Percentage of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder
and the other Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties
 plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination
of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining,
nonconverted Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion
of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes,
convertible preferred stock or warrants, including the Preferred Shares) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other Attribution Party
subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 4(d). For purposes of this
Section 4(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. For the avoidance of doubt,
the calculation of the Maximum Percentage shall take into account the concurrent exercise and/or conversion, as applicable, of the unexercised
or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such Holder and/or any other Attribution Party, as
applicable. For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion of
such Preferred Shares without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
as reflected in (x) the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form
8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other written
notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent, if any, setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the Reported
Outstanding Share Number ). If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify such Holder in writing of the number
of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause such Holder s beneficial
ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(d), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify the Company of
a reduced number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice. For any reason at any time, upon the written
or oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including such Preferred Shares, by such Holder
and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that the
issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of such Preferred Shares results in such Holder and the other Attribution
Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such Holder s and the other
Attribution Parties aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the Excess Shares shall
be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess
Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective
until the sixty-first (61 st day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other
percentage not in excess of 9.99 as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not
be effective until the sixty-first (61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or
decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an Attribution Party
of such Holder. For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of
Designations in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Holder for any purpose including
for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to this
paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination
of convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity
with the terms of this Section 4(d) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may
be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 4(d) or to make changes
or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitation contained in this paragraph may not
be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of such Preferred Shares.

(e)
 Mandatory Conversion . 

(i)
 General . If at any time (i) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal Market equals at least 300 of
the Conversion Price for twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days (each, a Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period ), and
(ii) no Equity Conditions Failure then exists, the Company shall have the right to require each Holder to convert all, or any number,
of the Preferred Shares, as designated in the Mandatory Conversion Notice (as defined below) into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof at the Conversion Rate as of the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined
below) (a Mandatory Conversion ). The Company may exercise its right to require conversion under this Section 4(e)
by delivering within five (5) Trading Days following the end of such Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period a written notice thereof by
electronic mail and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders and the Transfer Agent (the Mandatory Conversion
Notice and the date all of the Holders received such notice by electronic mail is referred to as the Mandatory Conversion
Notice Date ). The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable. The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall state (i) the Trading
Day selected for the Mandatory Conversion in accordance with this Section 4(e), which Trading Day shall be no less than two (2)
Trading Days and no more than fifteen (15) Trading Days following the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date (the Mandatory Conversion
Date ), (ii) the aggregate number of the Preferred Shares subject to mandatory conversion from each Holder pursuant to this
Section 4(e), (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to such Holder on the Mandatory Conversion Date and (iv) that
there has been no Equity Conditions Failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may effect only one (1) Mandatory Conversion
during any twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if the Closing Sale Price of the
Common Stock listed on the Principal Market fails to exceed the Conversion Price by 300 for each Trading Day commencing on the Mandatory
Conversion Notice Date and ending and including the Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date (a Mandatory
Conversion Price Failure or an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, (A) the
Company shall provide each Holder a subsequent notice to that effect and (B) unless such Holder waives the applicable Equity Conditions
Failure and/or Mandatory Conversion Price Failure, as applicable, the Mandatory Conversion shall be cancelled and the applicable Mandatory
Conversion Notice of such Holder shall be null and void and (ii) at any time prior to the date of consummation of the Mandatory Conversion
the Preferred Shares subject to such Mandatory Conversion may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common
Stock pursuant to Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Preferred Shares subject to a Mandatory Conversion may be converted
by a Holder hereunder prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date and such aggregate number of Preferred Shares converted hereunder
on or after the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date and prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date shall reduce the aggregate number of Preferred
Shares of such Holder required to be converted on such Mandatory Conversion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have
no right to effect a Mandatory Conversion if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no
effect upon any Holder s right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. 

7 

(ii)
 Pro Rata Conversion Requirement . If the Company elects to cause a Mandatory Conversion of any Preferred Shares pursuant to this
Section 4(e), then it must simultaneously take the same action in the same proportion with respect to all Holders of Preferred Shares. 

(f)
 Right of Alternate Conversion Upon a Triggering Event . 

(i)
 General . Subject to Section 4(d), at any time after the later of (A) the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Series
F Certificate of Designations) and (B) the earlier of a Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice (as defined below) and such
Holder becoming aware of a Triggering Event (such earlier date, the Alternate Conversion Right Commencement Date and ending (such ending date, the Alternate Conversion Right Expiration Date , and each such period, an Alternate
Conversion Right Period on the twentieth (20 th Trading Day after the later of (x) the date such Triggering Event
is cured and (y) such Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice that includes (I) a reasonable description of the applicable
Triggering Event, (II) a certification as to whether, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, such Triggering Event is capable of being
cured and, if applicable, a reasonable description of any existing plans of the Company to cure such Triggering Event and (III) a certification
as to the date the Triggering Event occurred and, if cured on or prior to the date of such Triggering Event Notice, the applicable Alternate
Conversion Right Expiration Date, such Holder may, at such Holder s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice to the Company (the
date of any such Conversion Notice, each an Alternate Conversion Date ), convert all, or any number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder into shares of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, an Alternate Conversion ). 

(ii)
 Mechanics of Alternate Conversion . On any Alternate Conversion Date, a Holder may voluntarily convert any number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder pursuant to Section 4(c) (with Alternate Conversion Price replacing Conversion Price 
for all purposes hereunder with respect to such Alternate Conversion and with the applicable Required Premium multiplied by the
Conversion Amount replacing Conversion Amount in clause (x) of the definition of Conversion Rate in Section 4(b)
above with respect to such Alternate Conversion) by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii)
of this Certificate of Designations that such Holder is electing to use the Alternate Conversion Price for such conversion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4(f)(ii), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Company delivers to such Holder the
shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to the applicable Alternate Conversion of such Holder s Preferred
Shares, such Preferred Shares may be converted by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(c) without regard
to this Section 4(f)(ii). In the event of an Alternate Conversion pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii) of all, or any portion,
of any Preferred Shares of a Holder, such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties 
inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for
such Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium due under this Section 4(f)(ii), together the Alternate Conversion Price used in
such Alternate Conversion, as applicable, is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of, such Holder s
actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.

 Rights Upon Fundamental Transactions . 

(a)
 Assumption . The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the Successor Entity assumes in writing
all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 6 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders,
including agreements to deliver to each holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for such Preferred Shares a security of the Successor
Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of Designations, including,
without limitation, having a stated value and dividend rate equal to the stated value and dividend rate of the Preferred Shares held
by the Holders and having similar ranking to the Preferred Shares, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Upon the occurrence
of any Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such
Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company 
shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations
of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity
had been named as the Company herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor
Entity shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares at
any time after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets
or other property (except such items still issuable under Sections 7 and 15, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter))
issuable upon the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly
traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) which each Holder would have been entitled
to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately
prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this
Certificate of Designations), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 6 to permit
the Fundamental Transaction without the assumption of the Preferred Shares. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly
and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption
of the Preferred Shares. 

12 

(b)
 Notice of a Change of Control; Change of Control Election Notice . No sooner than the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Trading Days prior
to the consummation of a Change of Control or (y) the public announcement of the entry into an agreement with respect to a Change of
Control, nor later than ten (10) Trading Days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control (the Change of Control Date ),
the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (a Change of Control
Notice ). At any time during the period beginning after a Holder s receipt of a Change of Control Notice or such Holder
becoming aware of a Change of Control if a Change of Control Notice is not delivered to such Holder in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence (as applicable) and ending on twenty (20) Trading Days after the later of (A) the date of consummation of such Change
of Control or (B) the date of receipt of such Change of Control Notice or (C) the date of the announcement of such Change of Control,
such Holder may require, by delivering written notice thereof Change of Control Election Notice to the Company
(which Change of Control Election Notice shall indicate the number of Preferred Shares subject to such election), to have the Company
exchange such Holder s Preferred Shares designated in such Change of Control Election Notice for consideration equal to the Change
of Control Election Price (as defined below), to be satisfied at the Company s election (such election to pay in cash or by delivery
of the Rights (as defined below), a Consideration Election ), in either (I) rights (with a beneficial ownership limitation
in the form of Section 4(d) hereof, mutatis mutandis (collectively, the Rights ), convertible in whole,
or in part, at any time, without the requirement to pay any additional consideration, at the option of the Required Holders, into such
Corporate Event Consideration (as defined below) applicable to such Change of Control equal in value to the Change of Control Election
Price, or (II) in cash. The Company shall give each Holder written notice of each Consideration Election at least ten (10) Trading Days
prior to the time of consummation of such Change of Control. Payment of such amounts or delivery of the Rights, as applicable, shall
be made by the Company (or at the Company s direction) to each Holder on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Trading Day after the
date of such request and (y) the date of consummation of such Change of Control (or, with respect to any Right, if applicable, such later
time that holders of shares of Common Stock are initially entitled to receive Corporate Event Consideration with respect to the shares
of Common Stock of such holder). Any Corporate Event Consideration included in the Rights, if any, pursuant to this Section 6(b)
is pari passu with the Corporate Event Consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Common Stock and the Company shall not
permit a payment of any Corporate Event Consideration to the holders of shares of Common Stock without on or prior to such time delivering
the Right to the Holders in accordance herewith. Cash payments, if any, required by this Section 6 (b) shall have priority to
payments to all other stockholders of the Company in connection with such Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 6 (b), but subject to Section 4(d), until the applicable Change of Control Election Price is paid in full
to the applicable Holder in cash or Corporate Event Consideration in accordance herewith, the Preferred Shares submitted by such Holder
for exchange or payment, as applicable, under this Section 6 (b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such Holder into
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 or in the event the Conversion Date is after the consummation of such Change of Control, stock
or equity interests of the Successor Entity substantially equivalent to the Company s shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section
 6. In the event of the Company s repayment or exchange, as applicable, of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 6 (b),
such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest
rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for a Holder. Accordingly, any Required
Premium due under this Section 6 (b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s
actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in connection with any
redemption hereunder at a time a Holder is entitled to receive a cash payment under any of the other Transaction Documents, at the option
of such Holder delivered in writing to the Company, the applicable redemption price hereunder shall be increased by the amount of such
cash payment owed to such Holder under such other Transaction Document and, upon payment in full or conversion in accordance herewith,
shall satisfy the Company s payment obligation under such other Transaction Document. 

7.
 Rights Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events . 

(a)
 Purchase Rights . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 8 and Section 15 below, if at any time the Company
grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata
to all or substantially all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each
Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder
could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred
Shares (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such
purpose that all the Preferred Shares were converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) held by such
Holder immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such
record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale
of such Purchase Rights; provided, however, to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would
result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate
in such Purchase Right to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of
Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and such Purchase Right
to such extent shall be held in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision,
such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable) for the benefit of such Holder until such time or
times, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage,
at which time or times such Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase
Right or on any subsequent Purchase Right held similarly in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date
or other similar provision, such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable)) to the same extent as
if there had been no such limitation. 

13 

(b)
 Other Corporate Events . In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any
Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect
to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision to
ensure that each Holder will thereafter have the right, at such Holder s option, to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder (i) such securities or other assets (the Corporate Event Consideration to which such
Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such Holder
upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the
Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon
such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the consummation
of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder
initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion
rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate of an Alternate Conversion. Provision made pursuant the preceding sentence
shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly
and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of
the Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations. 

8.
 Rights Upon Issuance of Other Securities . 

(a)
 Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock . If and whenever on or after the Subscription Date the Company grants,
issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell), or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have
granted, issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the granting, issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held
by or for the account of the Company, but excluding any Excluded Securities granted, issued or sold or deemed to have been granted, issued
or sold) for a consideration per share (the New Issuance Price less than a price equal to the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such granting, issuance or sale or deemed granting, issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect
is referred to herein as the Applicable Price (the foregoing a Dilutive Issuance ), then, immediately
after such Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price. For
all purposes of the foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under
this Section 8(a)), the following shall be applicable: 

(i)
 Issuance of Options . If the Company in any manner grants, issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell)
any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such
Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and
to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting, issuance or sale of such Option for such price per share. For
purposes of this Section 8(a)(i), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable
upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of
any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts
of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance
or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon
exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for which
one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon the exercise of any such
Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof, minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Option (or any other Person) with
respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion,
exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof plus
the value of any other consideration (including, without limitation, consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or any
other property) received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person). Except as contemplated
below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such
Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof or upon the actual issuance of such
shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

14 

(ii)
 Issuance of Convertible Securities . If the Company in any manner issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to issue or sell)
any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common
Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale (or the time
of execution of such agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes
of this Section 8(a)(ii), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the
conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the
sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon
the issuance or sale (or pursuant to the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of the Convertible Security and upon conversion,
exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set
forth in such Convertible Security for which one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market
conditions) upon conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts
paid or payable to the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the
issuance or sale (or the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Security plus the value of any other consideration
received or receivable (including, without limitation, any consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or other property)
by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further
adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of such Convertible Securities or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible
Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other
provisions of this Section 8(a), except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason
of such issuance or sale. 

(iii)
 Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion . If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible
Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time (other than
proportional changes in conversion or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in Section 8(a) below),
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been
in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional
consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes
of this Section 8(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (including, without limitation, any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the Subscription Date) are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding
sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(a)
shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. 

15 

(iv)
 Calculation of Consideration Received . If any Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right is issued in connection
with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (as determined by the Holder, the Primary
Security , and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the Secondary Securities 
and together with the Primary Security, each a Unit ), together comprising one integrated transaction, the aggregate
consideration per share of Common Stock with respect to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be the lower of (x) the purchase price
of such Unit, (y) if such Primary Security is an Option and/or Convertible Security, the lowest price per share for which one share of
Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Primary Security in accordance with 8(a)(i) or 8(a)(ii)
and (z) the lowest VWAP of the shares of Common Stock on any Trading Day during the five (5) Trading Day period (the Adjustment
Period immediately following the public announcement of such Dilutive Issuance (for the avoidance of doubt, if such public
announcement is released prior to the opening of the Principal Market on a Trading Day, such Trading Day shall be the first Trading Day
in such five Trading Day period and if any Preferred Shares are exercised, on any given Conversion Date during any such Adjustment Period,
solely with respect to such number of Preferred Shares converted on such applicable Conversion Date, such applicable Adjustment Period
shall be deemed to have ended on, and included, the Trading Day immediately prior to such Conversion Date). If any shares of Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor
will be deemed to be the net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the
fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of
consideration received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the
five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount
of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity
as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities (as the case may be). The fair value of any consideration
other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required Holder. If such parties are
unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the Valuation Event ),
the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10 th day following
such Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holder. The determination
of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall
be borne by the Company. 

(v)
 Record Date . If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive
a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale
of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution
or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). 

16 

(b)
 Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision of Section 7
or Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock
combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater
number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting
any provision of Section 7 or Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by any stock
split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares
of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately
increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(b) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision
or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment under this Section 8(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is
calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by rounding to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100 th
 of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or
held by or for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 

(d)
 Voluntary Adjustment by Company . Subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market and Section 8(g) below, the Company
may at any time any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, with the prior written consent of the Required Holder, reduce the then current
Conversion Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board. 

(e)
 Adjustments . If on the Applicable Date (as defined in the Series F Certificate of Designations) (the Adjustment Date ),
the Conversion Price then in effect is greater than the greater of (A) the Floor Price, and (B) the Market Price then in effect (the
 Adjustment Price ), on the Adjustment Date the Conversion Price shall automatically lower to the Adjustment Price. 

(f)
 [Intentionally Omitted] 

(g)
 Conversion Floor Price . Prior to the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Series F Certificate of Designations), no adjustment
pursuant to this Section 8 shall cause the Conversion Price to be less than 3.641 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split,
stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction occurring after the date of the Issuance Agreement) (the Conversion
Floor Price ). As of the Stockholder Approval Date, any Dilutive Issuances or other events that would have resulted in an adjustment
to the Conversion Price prior to the Stockholder Approval Date, but for the application of this Section 8(g), shall adjust the Conversion
Price hereunder as if such Dilutive Issuances and/or other events, as applicable, occurred on the Stockholder Approval Date. 

17 

9.
 Redemption at the Company s Election . At any time, the Company shall have the right to redeem all, but not less than all,
of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (the Company Optional Redemption Amount on the Company Optional Redemption
Date (each as defined below) (a Company Optional Redemption ). The Preferred Shares subject to redemption pursuant
to this Section 9 shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price (the Company Optional Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 110 of the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date and (ii) the product
of (1) the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date multiplied
by (2) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding
such Company Optional Redemption Notice Date and ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date the Company makes the entire
payment required to be made under this Section 9. The Company may exercise its right to require redemption under this Section 9
by delivering a written notice thereof by electronic mail and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders (the Company
Optional Redemption Notice and the date all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date ). Such Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable; provided that the Company Optional
Redemption Notice may be conditioned upon the consummation of a refinancing transaction or a Going Private Transaction. The Company Optional
Redemption Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Optional Redemption shall occur (the Company Optional Redemption
Date which date shall not be less than ten (10) Trading Days nor more than twenty (20) Trading Days following the Company
Optional Redemption Notice Date, and (y) state the aggregate Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares which is being redeemed in such
Company Optional Redemption from such Holder and all of the other Holders of the Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 9 on
the Company Optional Redemption Date. The Company shall deliver the applicable Company Optional Redemption Price to each Holder in cash
on the applicable Company Optional Redemption Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the date the
Company Optional Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Company Optional Redemption Amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by
any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4. All Conversion Amounts converted by a Holder after the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date shall reduce the Company Optional Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares of such Holder required to be redeemed
on the Company Optional Redemption Date. In the event of the Company s redemption of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section
 9, a Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future
interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly,
any redemption premium due under this Section 9 is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of
such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have
no right to effect a Company Optional Redemption if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall
have no effect upon any Holder s right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to a Going Private Transaction, the Company may effect a Company Optional Redemption under this Section 9, but with Change
of Control Election Price replacing Company Optional Redemption Price for all purposes in this Section 9 in
connection therewith. 

18 

10.
 Noncircumvention . The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation,
bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate
of Designations, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all action
as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision
of this Certificate of Designations or the other Transaction Documents, the Company (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares
of Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all
action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting
the conversion of the Preferred Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect
the conversion of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if after the sixty (60) calendar day anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder is not permitted
to convert such Holder s Preferred Shares in full for any reason (other than pursuant to restrictions set forth in Section 4(d)
hereof), the Company shall use its best efforts to promptly remedy such failure, including, without limitation, obtaining such consents
or approvals as necessary to effect such conversion into shares of Common Stock. 

11.
 Authorized Shares . 

(a)
 Reservation . So long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company shall at all times reserve at least 200 of the number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion, including without limitation, Alternate Conversions,
of all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding at the Alternate Conversion Price then in effect (without regard to any limitations on
conversions) (the Required Reserve Amount ). The Required Reserve Amount (including, without limitation, each increase
in the number of shares so reserved) shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of the Preferred Shares held by
each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the Authorized Share
Allocation ). In the event that a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder s Preferred Shares, each
transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder s Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved
and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders of Preferred Shares,
pro rata based on the number of the Preferred Shares then held by the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may allocate its
Authorized Share Allocation to any other of the securities of the Company held by such Holder (or any of its designees) by delivery of
a written notice to the Company. 

(b)
 Insufficient Authorized Shares . If, notwithstanding Section 11 (a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while
any of the Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common
Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall immediately take
all action necessary to increase the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to
reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after
the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase
in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with
a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of
Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal (or, if a majority
of the voting power then in effect of the capital stock of the Company consents to such increase, in lieu of such proxy statement, deliver
to the stockholders of the Company an information statement that has been filed with (and either approved by or not subject to comments
from) the SEC with respect thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any such time of an Authorized Share Failure, the Company is
able to obtain the written consent of a majority of the shares of its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock to approve the increase
in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, the Company may satisfy this obligation by obtaining such consent and submitting
for filing with the SEC an Information Statement on Schedule 14C. Nothing contained in Section 11 (a) or this Section 11(b)
shall limit any obligations of the Company under any provision of the Issuance Agreement. 

12.
 Voting Rights . The holders of the Preferred Shares shall have no voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time,
either as a separate series or class or together with any other series or class of share of capital stock, and shall not be entitled
to call a meeting of such holders for any purpose nor shall they be entitled to participate in any meeting of the holders of Common Stock,
except as provided in this Section 12 and Section 16 or as otherwise required by the DGCL. To the extent that under the DGCL
the vote of the holders of the Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given
action of the Company, the affirmative vote or consent of the Required Holders of the Preferred Shares, voting together in the aggregate
and not in separate series unless required under the DGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is presented or by written
consent of the Required Holders (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate
series unless required under the DGCL, shall constitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable. Holders
of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to written notice of all stockholder meetings or written consents (and copies of proxy materials
and other information sent to stockholders) with respect to which they would be entitled to vote, which notice would be provided pursuant
to the Company s bylaws (the Bylaws and the DGCL.

ordinary course of business in a manner and to an extent consistent with past practice and necessary or desirable for the prudent operation

(g)
 Independent Investigation . At the request of the Required Holders either (x) at any time when a Triggering Event has occurred
and is continuing, (y) upon the occurrence of an event that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute a Triggering

the Independent Investigator shall notify the Company of such breach and the Company shall deliver written notice to each Holder of such
breach. In connection with such investigation, the Independent Investigator may, during normal business hours, inspect all contracts,
books, records, personnel, offices and other facilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the extent available
to the Company after the Company uses reasonable efforts to obtain them, the records of its legal advisors and accountants and any books
of account, records, reports and other papers not contractually required of the Company to be confidential or secret, or subject to attorney-client
or other evidentiary privilege, and the Independent Investigator may make such copies and inspections thereof as the Independent Investigator

Funds ), before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of shares of Junior Stock, but pari passu with any Parity Stock
then outstanding, an amount per Preferred Share equal to the greater of (A) 110 of the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Share on
the date of such payment and (B) the amount per share such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Share into Common
Stock immediately prior to the date of such payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due
to the Holders and holders of shares of Parity Stock, then each Holder and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of
the Liquidation Funds equal to the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to such Holder and such holder of Parity Stock as a liquidation
preference, in accordance with their respective certificate of designations (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation
Funds payable to all holders of Preferred Shares and all holders of shares of Parity Stock. To the extent necessary, the Company shall

if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Preferred Shares (without taking
into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that the Preferred
Share was converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) immediately prior to the date on which a record
is taken for such Distribution or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined
for such Distributions provided , however , that to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such
Distribution would result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not
be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and the
portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would
not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times, if any, such Holder
shall be granted such Distribution (and any Distributions declared or made on such initial Distribution or on any subsequent Distribution
held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).

17.
 Transfer of Preferred Shares . A Holder may offer, sell or transfer some or all of its Preferred Shares without the consent of
the Company subject only to the provisions of Section 4(a) above. 

18.
 Reissuance of Preferred Share Certificates and Book Entries . 

(a)
 Transfer . If any Preferred Shares are to be transferred, the applicable Holder shall surrender the applicable Preferred Share

the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section
 18(d)) (or evidence of the transfer of such Book-Entry), registered as such Holder may request, representing the outstanding number
of Preferred Shares being transferred by such Holder and, if less than the entire outstanding number of Preferred Shares is being transferred,
a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to such Holder representing the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares not being transferred (or evidence of such remaining Preferred Shares in a Book-Entry for such Holder). Such Holder and any assignee,
by acceptance of the Preferred Share Certificate or evidence of Book-Entry issuance, as applicable, acknowledge and agree that, by reason
of the provisions of Section 4(c)(i) following conversion or redemption of any of the Preferred Shares, the outstanding number of
Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Shares may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face of the Preferred
Shares. 

(b)
 Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Preferred Share Certificate . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Preferred Share Certificate (as to which a written certification and the indemnification
contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking
by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of such Preferred Share Certificate, the Company shall execute and deliver to such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance
with Section 18(d)) representing the applicable outstanding number of Preferred Shares. 

(c)
 Preferred Share Certificate and Book-Entries Exchangeable for Different Denominations and Forms . Each Preferred Share Certificate

herein and no such merger or consolidation shall result inconsistent therewith. 

3. Dividends . 

(a) From
and after the first date of issuance of any Preferred Shares (the Initial Issuance Date ), the Preferred Shares shall
commence accruing dividends Dividends at the Dividend Rate computed on the basis of a 360-day year and twelve

be effected as a Capitalized Dividend. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if no Equity Conditions Failure has occurred
as of the Dividend Notice Date, but an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Dividend Date, (A) the Company shall
provide each Holder a subsequent notice to that effect and (B) unless such applicable Holder waives the Equity Conditions Failure, the
Dividend shall be paid to such Holder in cash. Dividend to be paid on a Dividend Date in Dividend Shares shall be paid in a number of

without limitation, for the Company s failure to pay such Dividends at the Default Rate on the applicable Dividend Date)), the
adjustment referred to in the preceding sentence shall cease to be effective as of the calendar day immediately following the date of
such cure; provided that the Dividends as calculated and unpaid at such increased rate during the continuance of such Triggering Event
shall continue to apply to the extent relating to the days after the occurrence of such Triggering Event through and including the date
of such cure of such Triggering Event.

shares of Common Stock (the Conversion Shares ), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4. 

(a) Holder s
Conversion Right . Subject to the provisions of Section 4(d), at any time or times on or after the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder
shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding Preferred Shares held by such Holder into validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable Conversion Shares in accordance with Section 4(c) at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). The Company shall not issue
any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of
Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any
and all transfer, stamp, issuance and similar taxes, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of the Transfer
Agent that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion of any Preferred Shares).

purposes of this Certificate of Designations, the term Conversion Amount means, with respect to each Preferred Share,
as of the applicable date of determination, the sum of (1) the Stated Value thereof plus (2) any Additional Amount thereon as
of such date of determination plus (3) any other amounts owed to such Holder pursuant to this Certificate of Designations or any
other Transaction Document. 

(ii) For
purposes of this Certificate of Designations, the term Conversion Price means, with respect to each Preferred Share,
as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination, 3.401, subject to adjustment as provided herein. 

3 

(c) Mechanics
of Conversion . The conversion of each Preferred Share shall be conducted in the following manner: 

(i) Optional
Conversion . To convert one or more Preferred Shares into Conversion Shares on any date (a Conversion Date ),
a Holder shall deliver (whether via electronic mail or otherwise), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York time, on such date,
a copy of an executed notice of conversion of the Preferred Share(s) subject to such conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
I (the Conversion Notice to the Company. If required by Section 4(c)(ii), within two (2) Trading Days following
a conversion of any such Preferred Shares as aforesaid, such Holder shall surrender to a nationally recognized overnight delivery service
for delivery to the Company the original certificates, if any, representing the Preferred Shares (the Preferred Share Certificates so converted as aforesaid (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to the Preferred Shares in the case of its loss, theft or destruction
as contemplated by Section 18(b)). On or before the first (1 st Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion
Notice, the Company shall transmit by electronic mail an acknowledgment of confirmation and representation as to whether such shares
of Common Stock may then be resold pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective and available registration statement, in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit II , of receipt of such Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Transfer Agent, which confirmation shall constitute
an instruction to the Transfer Agent to process such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms set forth herein. On or before the
first (1 st Trading Day following each date on which the Company has received a Conversion Notice (or such earlier date as
required pursuant to the 1934 Act or other applicable law, rule or regulation for the settlement of a trade initiated on the applicable
Conversion Date of such Conversion Shares issuable pursuant to such Conversion Notice) (the Share Delivery Deadline ),
the Company shall (1) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in FAST and such shares of Common Stock (i) (A) may then be sold
by the applicable Holder pursuant to an available and effective registration statement and (B) such Holder provides such documentation
or other information evidencing the sale of the shares of Common Stock as the Company, the Transfer Agent or legal counsel to the Company
shall reasonably request (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the requirement of a medallion guarantee or a legal opinion)
or (ii) may be sold by such Holder pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Act, as applicable (the Resale Eligibility Conditions ),
credit such aggregate number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled pursuant to such conversion to such Holder s
or its designee s balance account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system, or (2) if the Transfer Agent is
not participating in FAST or the Resale Eligibility Conditions are not satisfied, upon the request of such Holder, issue and deliver
(via reputable overnight courier) to the address as specified in such Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of such
Holder or its designee, for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled. If the number of Preferred Shares
represented by the Preferred Share Certificate(s) submitted for conversion pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) is greater than the number of
Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company shall, as soon as practicable and in no event later than two (2) Trading Days after
receipt of the Preferred Share Certificate(s) and at its own expense, issue and mail to such Holder (or its designee) by overnight courier
service a new Preferred Share Certificate or a new Book-Entry (in either case, in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the number
of Preferred Shares not converted. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion of Preferred
Shares shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Conversion Shares on the Conversion Date; provided,
that such Person shall be deemed to have waived any voting rights of any such Conversion Shares that may arise with respect to any record
date during the period commencing on such Conversion Date, through, and including, such applicable Share Delivery Deadline (each, an
 Conversion Period ), as necessary, such that the aggregate voting rights of any Common Stock (including such Conversion
Shares) beneficially owned by such Person and/or any of its Attribution Parties, collectively, on any such record date shall not exceed
the Maximum Percentage (as defined below) as a result of any such conversion of such applicable Preferred Shares with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder delivers a Conversion Notice to the Company prior to the date of issuance of Preferred Shares
to such Holder, whereby such Holder elects to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to such Conversion Notice, the Share Delivery Deadline
with respect to any such Conversion Notice shall be the later of (x) the date of issuance of such Preferred Shares and (y) the first
(1st) Trading Day after the date of such Conversion Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of
Designations or the Registration Rights Agreement, after the effective date of a Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration
Rights Agreement) and prior to a Holder s receipt of the notice of a Grace Period (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement),
the Company shall cause the Transfer Agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to such Holder (or its designee) in connection
with any sale of Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with respect to which such Holder has entered
into a contract for sale, and delivered a copy of the prospectus included as part of the particular Registration Statement to the extent
applicable, and for which such Holder has not yet settled. 

4 

(ii) Company s
Failure to Timely Convert . If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, on or prior to the applicable Share Delivery
Deadline, (I) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in FAST or the Resale Eligibility Conditions are not satisfied, to issue and
deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a certificate for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled and register
such Conversion Shares on the Company s share register or, (II) if the Transfer Agent is participating in FAST and the Resale Eligibility
Conditions are satisfied, to credit such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC for such number of Conversion
Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion of any Conversion Amount (as the case may be) (a Conversion
Failure ), and if on or after such Share Delivery Deadline such Holder acquires (in an open market transaction, stock loan
or otherwise) shares of Common Stock corresponding to all or any portion of the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon such conversion
that such Holder is entitled to receive from the Company and has not received from the Company in connection with such Conversion Failure
(a Buy-In ), then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, the Company shall, within two (2)
Business Days after receipt of such Holder s request and in such Holder s discretion, either: (I) pay cash to such Holder
in an amount equal to such Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, stock loan costs and other out-of-pocket
expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so acquired (including, without limitation, by any other Person in respect, or on behalf,
of such Holder) (the Buy-In Price ), at which point the Company s obligation to so issue and deliver such certificate
(and to issue such Conversion Shares) or credit to the balance account of such Holder or such Holder s designee, as applicable,
with DTC for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion hereunder (as the case
may be) (and to issue such Conversion Shares) shall terminate, or (II) promptly honor its obligation to so issue and deliver to such
Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Conversion Shares or credit the balance account of such Holder or such Holder s
designee, as applicable, with DTC for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion
hereunder (as the case may be) and pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product
of (x) such number of shares of Common Stock multiplied by (y) the lowest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during
the period commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending on the date of such issuance and payment under this
clause (II) (each, a Buy-In Payment Amount ). Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive
relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing Conversion Shares (or to electronically
deliver such Conversion Shares) upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares as required pursuant to the terms hereof. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any given Conversion Failure, this Section 4(c)(ii) shall not apply to a Holder to the
extent the Company has already paid such amounts in full to such Holder with respect to such Notice Failure pursuant to the analogous
sections of the Issuance Agreement. 

5 

(iii) Registration;
Book-Entry . At the time of issuance of any Preferred Shares hereunder, the applicable Holder may, by written request (including by
electronic-mail) to the Company, elect to receive such Preferred Shares in the form of one or more Preferred Share Certificates or in
Book-Entry form. The Company (or the Transfer Agent, as custodian for the Preferred Shares) shall maintain a register (the Register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Holders of each Preferred Share and the Stated Value of the Preferred Shares and
whether the Preferred Shares are held by such Holder in Preferred Share Certificates or in Book-Entry form (the Registered
Preferred Shares ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The
Company and each Holder of the Preferred Shares shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Preferred
Share for all purposes (including, without limitation, the right to receive payments and Dividends hereunder) notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. A Registered Preferred Share may be assigned, transferred or sold only by registration of such assignment or sale on
the Register. Upon its receipt of a written request to assign, transfer or sell one or more Registered Preferred Shares by such Holder
thereof, the Company shall record the information contained therein in the Register and issue one or more new Registered Preferred Shares
in the same aggregate Stated Value as the Stated Value of the surrendered Registered Preferred Shares to the designated assignee or transferee
pursuant to Section 18, provided that if the Company does not so record an assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be) of such
Registered Preferred Shares within two (2) Business Days of such a request, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to
reflect such assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4,
following conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the applicable Holder shall not be required to physically
surrender such Preferred Shares held in the form of a Preferred Share Certificate to the Company unless (A) the full or remaining number
of Preferred Shares represented by the applicable Preferred Share Certificate are being converted (in which event such certificate(s)
shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(iii)) or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written
notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of the
applicable Preferred Share Certificate. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Stated Value and Dividends converted
and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) or shall use such other method,
reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of a Preferred Share Certificate upon
conversion. If the Company does not update the Register to record such Stated Value and Dividends converted and/or paid (as the case
may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) within two (2) Business Days of such occurrence, then
the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to reflect such occurrence. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records
of the Company establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling and determinative
in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge and agree that,
by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred Shares represented
by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each Preferred Share Certificate shall
bear the following legend: 

ANY
TRANSFEREE OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING
TO THE SHARES OF SERIES F CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(iii) THEREOF. THE NUMBER
OF SHARES OF SERIES F CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES F CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(iii) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE SHARES OF
SERIES F CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE. 

(iv) Pro
Rata Conversion; Disputes . In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same Conversion
Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert from
each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted
for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to
the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of Conversion
Shares issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of
Conversion Shares not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. If a Conversion Notice delivered to the Company
would result in a breach of Section 4(d) below, and the applicable Holder does not elect in writing to withdraw, in whole, such Conversion
Notice, the Company shall hold such Conversion Notice in abeyance until such time as such Conversion Notice may be satisfied without
violating Section 4(d) below (with such calculations thereunder made as of the date such Conversion Notice was initially delivered to
the Company). 

6 

(d) Limitation
on Beneficial Ownership . The Company shall not effect the conversion of any of the Preferred Shares held by a Holder, and such Holder
shall not have the right to convert any of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Certificate
of Designations and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after giving effect to
such conversion, such Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess of 4.99 (the
 Maximum Percentage of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and the other
Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties plus
 the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination of
such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted
Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised
or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes, convertible preferred
stock or warrants, including the Preferred Shares and the Warrants) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other Attribution Party
subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 4(d). For purposes of this Section
4(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the calculation
of the Maximum Percentage shall take into account the concurrent exercise and/or conversion, as applicable, of the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such Holder and/or any other Attribution Party, as applicable. For
purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion of such Preferred Shares
without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x)
the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public
filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other written notice by the
Company or the Transfer Agent, if any, setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the Reported Outstanding
Share Number ). If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify such Holder in writing of the number of
shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause such Holder s beneficial
ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(d), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify the Company of a reduced
number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice. For any reason at any time, upon the written or
oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including such Preferred Shares, by such Holder
and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that the
issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of such Preferred Shares results in such Holder and the other Attribution
Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such Holder s and the other
Attribution Parties aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the Excess Shares shall
be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess
Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective
until the sixty-first (61 st day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other
percentage not in excess of 9.99 as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not
be effective until the sixty-first (61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or
decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an Attribution Party
of such Holder. For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of
Designations in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Holder for any purpose including
for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to this
paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination
of convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity
with the terms of this Section 4(d) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be
defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 4(d) or to make changes or supplements
necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall
apply to a successor holder of such Preferred Shares.

(e) Mandatory
Conversion . 

(i) General .
If at any time (i) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal Market equals at least 300 of the Conversion Price
for twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days (each, a Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period ), and (ii) no Equity Conditions
Failure then exists, the Company shall have the right to require each Holder to convert all, or any number, of the Preferred Shares,
as designated in the Mandatory Conversion Notice (as defined below) into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof at the Conversion Rate as of the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined below) (a Mandatory
Conversion ). The Company may exercise its right to require conversion under this Section 4(e) by delivering within five (5)
Trading Days following the end of such Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period a written notice thereof by electronic mail and overnight
courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders and the Transfer Agent (the Mandatory Conversion Notice and
the date all of the Holders received such notice by electronic mail is referred to as the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date ).
The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable. The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall state (i) the Trading Day selected for the
Mandatory Conversion in accordance with this Section 4(e), which Trading Day shall be no less than two (2) Trading Days and no more than
fifteen (15) Trading Days following the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date (the Mandatory Conversion Date ), (ii) the
aggregate number of the Preferred Shares subject to mandatory conversion from each Holder pursuant to this Section 4(e), (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock to be issued to such Holder on the Mandatory Conversion Date and (iv) that there has been no Equity Conditions
Failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may effect only one (1) Mandatory Conversion during any twenty (20) consecutive Trading
Days. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal Market
fails to exceed the Conversion Price by 300 for each Trading Day commencing on the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date and ending and including
the Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date (a Mandatory Conversion Price Failure or an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, (A) the Company shall provide each Holder
a subsequent notice to that effect and (B) unless such Holder waives the applicable Equity Conditions Failure and/or Mandatory Conversion
Price Failure, as applicable, the Mandatory Conversion shall be cancelled and the applicable Mandatory Conversion Notice of such Holder
shall be null and void and (ii) at any time prior to the date of consummation of the Mandatory Conversion the Preferred Shares subject
to such Mandatory Conversion may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Preferred Shares subject to a Mandatory Conversion may be converted by a Holder hereunder prior to
the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date and such aggregate number of Preferred Shares converted hereunder on or after the Mandatory
Conversion Notice Date and prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date shall reduce the aggregate number of Preferred Shares of such Holder
required to be converted on such Mandatory Conversion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no right to effect a Mandatory
Conversion if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s
right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. 

(ii) Pro
Rata Conversion Requirement . If the Company elects to cause a Mandatory Conversion of any Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section
4(e), then it must simultaneously take the same action in the same proportion with respect to all Holders of Preferred Shares. 

8 

(f) Right
of Alternate Conversion Upon a Triggering Event . 

(i) General .
Subject to Section 4(d), at any time after the later of (A) the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Issuance Agreement and (B)
the earlier of a Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice (as defined below) and such Holder becoming aware of a Triggering
Event (such earlier date, the Alternate Conversion Right Commencement Date and ending (such ending date, the Alternate
Conversion Right Expiration Date , and each such period, an Alternate Conversion Right Period on the
twentieth (20 th Trading Day after the later of (x) the date such Triggering Event is cured and (y) such Holder s receipt
of a Triggering Event Notice that includes (I) a reasonable description of the applicable Triggering Event, (II) a certification as to
whether, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, such Triggering Event is capable of being cured and, if applicable, a reasonable description
of any existing plans of the Company to cure such Triggering Event and (III) a certification as to the date the Triggering Event occurred
and, if cured on or prior to the date of such Triggering Event Notice, the applicable Alternate Conversion Right Expiration Date, such
Holder may, at such Holder s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice to the Company (the date of any such Conversion Notice,
each an Alternate Conversion Date ), convert all, or any number of Preferred Shares held by such Holder into shares
of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, an Alternate Conversion ). 

(ii) Mechanics
of Alternate Conversion . On any Alternate Conversion Date, a Holder may voluntarily convert any number of Preferred Shares held by
such Holder pursuant to Section 4(c) (with Alternate Conversion Price replacing Conversion Price for all
purposes hereunder with respect to such Alternate Conversion and with the applicable Required Premium multiplied by the Conversion
Amount replacing Conversion Amount in clause (x) of the definition of Conversion Rate in Section 4(b) above with
respect to such Alternate Conversion) by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii) of this Certificate
of Designations that such Holder is electing to use the Alternate Conversion Price for such conversion. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 4(f)(ii), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Company delivers to such Holder the shares of Common Stock
to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to the applicable Alternate Conversion of such Holder s Preferred Shares, such Preferred
Shares may be converted by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(c) without regard to this Section 4(f)(ii).
In the event of an Alternate Conversion pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii) of all, or any portion, of any Preferred Shares of a Holder,
such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest
rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly, any redemption
premium due under this Section 4(f)(ii), together the Alternate Conversion Price used in such Alternate Conversion, as applicable, is
intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of, such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity
and not as a penalty.

6. Rights
Upon Fundamental Transactions . 

(a) Assumption .
The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the Successor Entity assumes in writing all of the obligations
of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section
6 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, including agreements to deliver
to each holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for such Preferred Shares a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument
substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of Designations, including, without limitation, having a stated value
and dividend rate equal to the stated value and dividend rate of the Preferred Shares held by the Holders and having similar ranking
to the Preferred Shares, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the
Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions
of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company shall refer instead to
the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under
this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named
as the Company herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity
shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares at any time
after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other
property (except such items still issuable under Sections 7 and 15, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon
the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly traded common
stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) which each Holder would have been entitled to receive
upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior
to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate
of Designations), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 6 to permit the Fundamental
Transaction without the assumption of the Preferred Shares. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly and equally to successive
Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares. 

14 

(b) Notice
of a Change of Control; Change of Control Election Notice . No sooner than the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Trading Days prior to the
consummation of a Change of Control or (y) the public announcement of the entry into an agreement with respect to a Change of Control,
nor later than ten (10) Trading Days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control (the Change of Control Date ),
the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (a Change of Control
Notice ). At any time during the period beginning after a Holder s receipt of a Change of Control Notice or such Holder
becoming aware of a Change of Control if a Change of Control Notice is not delivered to such Holder in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence (as applicable) and ending on twenty (20) Trading Days after the later of (A) the date of consummation of such Change
of Control or (B) the date of receipt of such Change of Control Notice or (C) the date of the announcement of such Change of Control,
such Holder may require, by delivering written notice thereof Change of Control Election Notice to the Company
(which Change of Control Election Notice shall indicate the number of Preferred Shares subject to such election), to have the Company
exchange such Holder s Preferred Shares designated in such Change of Control Election Notice for consideration equal to the Change
of Control Election Price (as defined below), to be satisfied at the Company s election (such election to pay in cash or by delivery
of the Rights (as defined below), a Consideration Election ), in either (I) rights (with a beneficial ownership limitation
in the form of Section 4(d) hereof, mutatis mutandis (collectively, the Rights ), convertible in whole, or
in part, at any time, without the requirement to pay any additional consideration, at the option of the Required Holders, into such Corporate
Event Consideration (as defined below) applicable to such Change of Control equal in value to the Change of Control Election Price, or
(II) in cash. The Company shall give each Holder written notice of each Consideration Election at least ten (10) Trading Days prior to
the time of consummation of such Change of Control. Payment of such amounts or delivery of the Rights, as applicable, shall be made by
the Company (or at the Company s direction) to each Holder on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Trading Day after the date of such
request and (y) the date of consummation of such Change of Control (or, with respect to any Right, if applicable, such later time that
holders of shares of Common Stock are initially entitled to receive Corporate Event Consideration with respect to the shares of Common
Stock of such holder). Any Corporate Event Consideration included in the Rights, if any, pursuant to this Section 6(b) is pari passu
 with the Corporate Event Consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Common Stock and the Company shall not permit a payment
of any Corporate Event Consideration to the holders of shares of Common Stock without on or prior to such time delivering the Right to
the Holders in accordance herewith. Cash payments, if any, required by this Section 6(b) shall have priority to payments to all other
stockholders of the Company in connection with such Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(b),
but subject to Section 4(d), until the applicable Change of Control Election Price is paid in full to the applicable Holder in cash or
Corporate Event Consideration in accordance herewith, the Preferred Shares submitted by such Holder for exchange or payment, as applicable,
under this Section 6(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 or in the event
the Conversion Date is after the consummation of such Change of Control, stock or equity interests of the Successor Entity substantially
equivalent to the Company s shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 6. In the event of the Company s repayment or exchange,
as applicable, of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 6(b), such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to
estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable
substitute investment opportunity for a Holder. Accordingly, any Required Premium due under this Section 6(b) is intended by the parties
to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in connection with any redemption hereunder at a time a Holder is entitled to receive
a cash payment under any of the other Transaction Documents, at the option of such Holder delivered in writing to the Company, the applicable
redemption price hereunder shall be increased by the amount of such cash payment owed to such Holder under such other Transaction Document
and, upon payment in full or conversion in accordance herewith, shall satisfy the Company s payment obligation under such other
Transaction Document. 

15 

7. Rights
Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events . 

(a) Purchase
Rights . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 8 and Section 15 below, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells
any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all or substantially
all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder will be entitled
to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if
such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares (without taking
into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that all the
Preferred Shares were converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) held by such Holder immediately prior
to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date
as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights; provided,
however, to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in such Holder and the other
Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to
such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of
such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held
in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision, such term shall be extended
by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable) for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times, if ever, as its right
thereto would not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times such
Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase Right or on any subsequent
Purchase Right held similarly in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision,
such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable)) to the same extent as if there had been no such
limitation. 

(b) Other
Corporate Events . In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental
Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or
in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure
that each Holder will thereafter have the right, at such Holder s option, to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred Shares
held by such Holder (i) such securities or other assets (the Corporate Event Consideration to which such Holder
would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such Holder upon the
consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred
Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion,
such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate
Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder initially been
issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such
consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate of an Alternate Conversion. Provision made pursuant the preceding sentence shall
be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly and
equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of the
Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations. 

16 

8. Rights
Upon Issuance of Other Securities . 

(a) Adjustment
of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock . If and whenever on or after the Subscription Date the Company grants, issues or
sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell), or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have granted, issued
or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the granting, issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account
of the Company, but excluding any Excluded Securities granted, issued or sold or deemed to have been granted, issued or sold) for a consideration
per share (the New Issuance Price less than a price equal to the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such granting, issuance or sale or deemed granting, issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect is referred to herein as the
 Applicable Price (the foregoing a Dilutive Issuance ), then, immediately after such Dilutive
Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price. For all purposes of the
foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under this Section 8(a)),
the following shall be applicable: 

(i) Issuance
of Options . If the Company in any manner grants, issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell) any Options
and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the
terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued
and sold by the Company at the time of the granting, issuance or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section
8(a)(i), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such
Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received
or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise
of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for which one share of Common Stock is issuable
(or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, minus (2)
the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Option (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock
upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible
Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof plus the value of any other consideration (including,
without limitation, consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or any other property) received or receivable by, or benefit
conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion
Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such
Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof or upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise
or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

(ii) Issuance
of Convertible Securities . If the Company in any manner issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to issue or sell) any Convertible
Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion, exercise or
exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall
be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale (or the time of execution
of such agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this
Section 8(a)(ii), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the
lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon the issuance
or sale (or pursuant to the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of the Convertible Security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange
of such Convertible Security or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such Convertible
Security for which one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder
of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale (or the agreement
to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Security plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable (including,
without limitation, any consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or other property) by, or benefit conferred on, the
holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price
shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities
or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of
any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 8(a),
except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issuance or sale. 

17 

(iii) Change
in Option Price or Rate of Conversion . If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible
Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time (other than
proportional changes in conversion or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in Section 8(a) below),
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been
in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional
consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes
of this Section 8(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (including, without limitation, any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the Subscription Date) are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding
sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(a)
shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. 

(iv) Calculation
of Consideration Received . If any Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right is issued in connection with the issuance
or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (as determined by the Holder, the Primary Security ,
and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the Secondary Securities and together with
the Primary Security, each a Unit ), together comprising one integrated transaction, the aggregate consideration
per share of Common Stock with respect to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be the lower of (x) the purchase price of such Unit,
(y) if such Primary Security is an Option and/or Convertible Security, the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock
is at any time issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Primary Security in accordance with 8(a)(i) or 8(a)(ii) and (z) the lowest
VWAP of the shares of Common Stock on any Trading Day during the five (5) Trading Day period (the Adjustment Period immediately following the public announcement of such Dilutive Issuance (for the avoidance of doubt, if such public announcement is released
prior to the opening of the Principal Market on a Trading Day, such Trading Day shall be the first Trading Day in such five Trading Day
period and if any Preferred Shares are exercised, on any given Conversion Date during any such Adjustment Period, solely with respect
to such number of Preferred Shares converted on such applicable Conversion Date, such applicable Adjustment Period shall be deemed to
have ended on, and included, the Trading Day immediately prior to such Conversion Date). If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be
the net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the fair value of
such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration
received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the five (5) Trading
Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners
of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor
will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to
such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities (as the case may be). The fair value of any consideration other than cash
or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required Holder. If such parties are unable to reach
agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the Valuation Event ), the fair
value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10 th day following such Valuation
Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holder. The determination of such appraiser
shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. 

18 

(v) Record
Date . If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend
or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase shares
of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the
shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution
or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). 

(b) Adjustment
of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision of Section 7 or Section 15, if
the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization
or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision of Section 7 or
Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination,
recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant
to this Section 8(b) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring
an adjustment under this Section 8(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation
of such Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c) Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by rounding to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100 th of a share, as
applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account
of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 

(d) Voluntary
Adjustment by Company . Subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market and Section 8(g) below, the Company may at any
time any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, with the prior written consent of the Required Holder, reduce the then current Conversion
Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board. 

(e) Adjustments .
If on the Applicable Date (as defined in the Issuance Agreement) (the Adjustment Date ), the Conversion Price then
in effect is greater than the greater of (A) the Floor Price, and (B) the Market Price then in effect (the Adjustment Price ),
on the Adjustment Date the Conversion Price shall automatically lower to the Adjustment Price. 

19 

(f) Exchange
Right . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates any Subsequent Placement
(other than with respect to Excluded Securities), and a Holder elects in writing to the Company to participate in such Subsequent Placement,
each such Holder may, at the option of such Holder as elected in writing to the Company, exchange all, or any part, of the Preferred
Shares of such Holder into the securities in such Subsequent Placement (with the aggregate amount of such securities to be issued in
such exchange equal to such aggregate amount of such securities with a purchase price valued at 105 of the Conversion Amount of the
Preferred Shares delivered by such Holder in exchange therefor). 

(g) Conversion
Floor Price . Prior to the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Issuance Agreement), no adjustment pursuant to this Section
8 shall cause the Conversion Price to be less than 3.401 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification
or similar transaction occurring after the date of the Issuance Agreement) (the Conversion Floor Price ). As of the
Stockholder Approval Date, any Dilutive Issuances or other events that would have resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price prior
to the Stockholder Approval Date, but for the application of this Section 8(g), shall adjust the Conversion Price hereunder as if such
Dilutive Issuances and/or other events, as applicable, occurred on the Stockholder Approval Date. 

9. Redemption
at the Company s Election . At any time, the Company shall have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Preferred
Shares then outstanding (the Company Optional Redemption Amount on the Company Optional Redemption Date (each as
defined below) (a Company Optional Redemption ). The Preferred Shares subject to redemption pursuant to this Section
9 shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price (the Company Optional Redemption Price equal to the greater
of (i) 110 of the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date and (ii) the product of (1) the Conversion
Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date multiplied by (2) the greatest Closing
Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding such Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date and ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date the Company makes the entire payment required to be
made under this Section 9. The Company may exercise its right to require redemption under this Section 9 by delivering a written notice
thereof by electronic mail and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders (the Company Optional Redemption
Notice and the date all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the Company Optional Redemption Notice
Date ). Such Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable; provided that the Company Optional Redemption Notice
may be conditioned upon the consummation of a refinancing transaction or a Going Private Transaction. The Company Optional Redemption
Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Optional Redemption shall occur (the Company Optional Redemption Date which date shall not be less than ten (10) Trading Days nor more than twenty (20) Trading Days following the Company Optional Redemption
Notice Date, and (y) state the aggregate Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares which is being redeemed in such Company Optional Redemption
from such Holder and all of the other Holders of the Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 9 on the Company Optional Redemption Date.
The Company shall deliver the applicable Company Optional Redemption Price to each Holder in cash on the applicable Company Optional
Redemption Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the date the Company Optional Redemption Price
is paid, in full, the Company Optional Redemption Amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common Stock
pursuant to Section 4. All Conversion Amounts converted by a Holder after the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date shall reduce the
Company Optional Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares of such Holder required to be redeemed on the Company Optional Redemption
Date. In the event of the Company s redemption of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 9, a Holder s damages would
be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of
the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium due under this
Section 9 is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss of its investment
opportunity and not as a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no right to effect a Company Optional Redemption
if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s right to convert
Preferred Shares in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Going Private Transaction, the Company may effect
a Company Optional Redemption under this Section 9, but with Change of Control Election Price replacing Company
Optional Redemption Price for all purposes in this Section 9 in connection therewith. 

20 

10. Noncircumvention .
The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws or through
any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any
other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate of Designations,
and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all action as may be required
to protect the rights of the Holders hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of this Certificate
of Designations or the other Transaction Documents, the Company (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable
upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the
conversion of Preferred Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and
keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred
Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of the Preferred
Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
if after the sixty (60) calendar day anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder is not permitted to convert such Holder s
Preferred Shares in full for any reason (other than pursuant to restrictions set forth in Section 4(d) hereof), the Company shall use
its best efforts to promptly remedy such failure, including, without limitation, obtaining such consents or approvals as necessary to
effect such conversion into shares of Common Stock. 

11. Authorized
Shares . 

(a) Reservation .
So long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company shall at all times reserve at least 200 of the number of shares of Common
Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion, including without limitation, Alternate Conversions, of all of
the Preferred Shares then outstanding at the Alternate Conversion Price then in effect (without regard to any limitations on conversions)
(the Required Reserve Amount ). The Required Reserve Amount (including, without limitation, each increase in the
number of shares so reserved) shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of the Preferred Shares held by each
Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the Authorized Share
Allocation ). In the event that a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder s Preferred Shares, each
transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder s Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved
and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders of Preferred Shares,
pro rata based on the number of the Preferred Shares then held by the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may allocate its
Authorized Share Allocation to any other of the securities of the Company held by such Holder (or any of its designees) by delivery of
a written notice to the Company. 

(b) Insufficient
Authorized Shares . If, notwithstanding Section 11(a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while any of the Preferred Shares
remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation
to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve
Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the
Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount
for the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the
date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Authorized
Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares
of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its
best efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board
of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal (or, if a majority of the voting power then in effect of
the capital stock of the Company consents to such increase, in lieu of such proxy statement, deliver to the stockholders of the Company
an information statement that has been filed with (and either approved by or not subject to comments from) the SEC with respect thereto).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any such time of an Authorized Share Failure, the Company is able to obtain the written consent
of a majority of the shares of its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock to approve the increase in the number of authorized
shares of Common Stock, the Company may satisfy this obligation by obtaining such consent and submitting for filing with the SEC an Information
Statement on Schedule 14C. Nothing contained in Section 11(a) or this Section 11(b) shall limit any obligations of the Company under
any provision of the Issuance Agreement or Registration Rights Agreement. 

21 

12. Voting
Rights . The holders of the Preferred Shares shall have no voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time, either as
a separate series or class or together with any other series or class of share of capital stock, and shall not be entitled to call a
meeting of such holders for any purpose nor shall they be entitled to participate in any meeting of the holders of Common Stock, except
as provided in this Section 12 and Section 16 or as otherwise required by the DGCL. To the extent that under the DGCL the vote of the
holders of the Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given action of the
Company, the affirmative vote or consent of the Required Holders of the Preferred Shares, voting together in the aggregate and not in
separate series unless required under the DGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is presented or by written consent
of the Required Holders (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate series
unless required under the DGCL, shall constitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable. Holders
of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to written notice of all stockholder meetings or written consents (and copies of proxy materials
and other information sent to stockholders) with respect to which they would be entitled to vote, which notice would be provided pursuant
to the Company s bylaws (the Bylaws and the DGCL.

such qualification necessary, except where the failure to become or remain duly qualified or in good standing could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

(a) Transactions
with Affiliates . The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into, renew, extend or be a party to,
any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, lease, transfer or exchange of

of business in a manner and to an extent consistent with past practice and necessary or desirable for the prudent operation of its business,

length transaction with a Person that is not an affiliate thereof. 

22 

(b) Restricted
Issuances . The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Required Holders, (i) issue any
Preferred Shares (other than as contemplated by the Issuance Agreement and this Certificate of Designations and the acquisition of the
Theralink Business), or (ii) issue any other securities that would cause a breach or default under this Certificate of Designations or
the Warrants. 

(c) PCAOB

audit its financial statements that is registered with (and in compliance with the rules and regulations of) the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. 

(d)
 Independent Investigation . At the request of the Required Holders either (x) at any time when a Triggering Event has occurred
and is continuing, (y) upon the occurrence of an event that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute a Triggering
Event or (z) at any time such Required Holders reasonably believe a Triggering Event may have occurred or be continuing, the Company
shall hire an independent, reputable investment bank selected by the Company and approved by such Holder (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to investigate as to whether any breach of this Certificate of Designations has occurred (the Independent
Investigator ). If the Independent Investigator determines that such breach of this Certificate of Designations has occurred,
the Independent Investigator shall notify the Company of such breach and the Company shall deliver written notice to each Holder of such
breach. In connection with such investigation, the Independent Investigator may, during normal business hours, inspect all contracts,
books, records, personnel, offices and other facilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the extent available
to the Company after the Company uses reasonable efforts to obtain them, the records of its legal advisors and accountants and any books
of account, records, reports and other papers not contractually required of the Company to be confidential or secret, or subject to attorney-client
or other evidentiary privilege, and the Independent Investigator may make such copies and inspections thereof as the Independent Investigator

permit the Independent Investigator to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Company with, and to make proposals and furnish
advice with respect thereto to, the Company s officers, directors, key employees and independent public accountants or any of them

of the Company, whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders (the Liquidation Funds ),
before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of shares of Junior Stock, but pari passu with any Parity Stock then outstanding,

and (B) the amount per share such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Share into Common Stock immediately prior
to the date of such payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the Holders and holders
of shares of Parity Stock, then each Holder and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of the Liquidation Funds equal
to the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to such Holder and such holder of Parity Stock as a liquidation preference, in accordance
with their respective certificate of designations (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to
all holders of Preferred Shares and all holders of shares of Parity Stock. To the extent necessary, the Company shall cause such actions
to be taken by each of its Subsidiaries so as to enable, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the proceeds of a Liquidation Event

of capital or otherwise (including without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way
of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (the Distributions ),
then each Holder, as holders of Preferred Shares, will be entitled to such Distributions as if such Holder had held the number of shares
of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Preferred Shares (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions
on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that the Preferred Share was converted at the Alternate Conversion
Price as of the applicable record date) immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for such Distribution or, if no such
record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for such Distributions provided ,
 however , that to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution would result in such Holder
and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution
to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result
of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held
in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and the other
Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times, if any, such Holder shall be granted such Distribution
(and any Distributions declared or made on such initial Distribution or on any subsequent Distribution held similarly in abeyance) to
the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).

provided for the benefit of the Preferred Shares hereunder, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized
number of shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock; (c) without limiting any provision of Section 2, create or authorize (by reclassification
or otherwise) any new class or series of Senior Preferred Stock or Parity Stock; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any shares of Junior
Stock (other than pursuant to the terms of the Company s equity incentive plans and options and other equity awards granted under
such plans (that have in good faith been approved by the Board)); (e) without limiting any provision of Section 2, pay dividends or make
any other distribution on any shares of any Junior Stock; (f) issue any Preferred Shares other than as contemplated hereby or pursuant
to the Issuance Agreement; or (g) without limiting any provision of Section 14, whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Preferred
Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares hereunder. 

17. Transfer
of Preferred Shares . A Holder may offer, sell or transfer some or all of its Preferred Shares without the consent of the Company
subject only to the provisions of Section 5 of the Issuance Agreement. 

18. Reissuance
of Preferred Share Certificates and Book Entries . 

(a) Transfer .
If any Preferred Shares are to be transferred, the applicable Holder shall surrender the applicable Preferred Share Certificate to the
Company (or, if the Preferred Shares are held in Book-Entry form, a written instruction letter to the Company), whereupon the Company
will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section 18(d)) (or
evidence of the transfer of such Book-Entry), registered as such Holder may request, representing the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares being transferred by such Holder and, if less than the entire outstanding number of Preferred Shares is being transferred, a new
Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to such Holder representing the outstanding number of Preferred Shares
not being transferred (or evidence of such remaining Preferred Shares in a Book-Entry for such Holder). Such Holder and any assignee,
by acceptance of the Preferred Share Certificate or evidence of Book-Entry issuance, as applicable, acknowledge and agree that, by reason
of the provisions of Section 4(c)(i) following conversion or redemption of any of the Preferred Shares, the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares represented by the Preferred Shares may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face of the Preferred Shares. 

24 

(b) Lost,
Stolen or Mutilated Preferred Share Certificate . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of
the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Preferred Share Certificate (as to which a written certification and the indemnification
contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking
by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of such Preferred Share Certificate, the Company shall execute and deliver to such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance
with Section 18(d)) representing the applicable outstanding number of Preferred Shares. 

(c) Preferred
Share Certificate and Book-Entries Exchangeable for Different Denominations and Forms . Each Preferred Share Certificate is exchangeable,
upon the surrender hereof by the applicable Holder at the principal office of the Company, for a new Preferred Share Certificate or Preferred
Share Certificate(s) or new Book-Entry (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing, in the aggregate, the outstanding number of the

as of the Dividend Notice Date, but an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Dividend Date, (A) the Company shall

non-assessable Conversion Shares in accordance with Section 4(c) at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). The Company shall not issue

purposes of this Certificate of Designations, the term Conversion Amount means, with respect to each Preferred Share,
as of the applicable date of determination, the sum of (1) the Stated Value thereof plus (2) any Additional Amount thereon as
of such date of determination plus (3) any other amounts owed to such Holder pursuant to this Certificate of Designations or any
other Transaction Document. 

(ii) For
purposes of this Certificate of Designations, the term Conversion Price means, with respect to each Preferred Share,
as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination, 1.57, subject to adjustment as provided herein. 

(c) Mechanics
of Conversion . The conversion of each Preferred Share shall be conducted in the following manner: 

(i) Optional
Conversion . To convert one or more Preferred Shares into Conversion Shares on any date (a Conversion Date ),
a Holder shall deliver (whether via electronic mail or otherwise), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York time, on such date,
a copy of an executed notice of conversion of the Preferred Share(s) subject to such conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
I (the Conversion Notice to the Company. If required by Section 4(c)(ii), within two (2) Trading Days following
a conversion of any such Preferred Shares as aforesaid, such Holder shall surrender to a nationally recognized overnight delivery service
for delivery to the Company the original certificates, if any, representing the Preferred Shares (the Preferred Share Certificates so converted as aforesaid (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to the Preferred Shares in the case of its loss, theft or destruction
as contemplated by Section 18(b)). On or before the first (1 st Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion
Notice, the Company shall transmit by electronic mail an acknowledgment of confirmation and representation as to whether such shares
of Common Stock may then be resold pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective and available registration statement, in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit II , of receipt of such Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Transfer Agent, which confirmation shall constitute
an instruction to the Transfer Agent to process such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms set forth herein. On or before the
first (1 st Trading Day following each date on which the Company has received a Conversion Notice (or such earlier date as
required pursuant to the 1934 Act or other applicable law, rule or regulation for the settlement of a trade initiated on the applicable
Conversion Date of such Conversion Shares issuable pursuant to such Conversion Notice) (the Share Delivery Deadline ),
the Company shall (1) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in FAST and such shares of Common Stock (i) (A) may then be sold
by the applicable Holder pursuant to an available and effective registration statement and (B) such Holder provides such documentation
or other information evidencing the sale of the shares of Common Stock as the Company, the Transfer Agent or legal counsel to the Company
shall reasonably request (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the requirement of a medallion guarantee or a legal opinion)
or (ii) may be sold by such Holder pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Act, as applicable (the Resale Eligibility Conditions ),
credit such aggregate number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled pursuant to such conversion to such Holder s
or its designee s balance account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system, or (2) if the Transfer Agent is
not participating in FAST or the Resale Eligibility Conditions are not satisfied, upon the request of such Holder, issue and deliver
(via reputable overnight courier) to the address as specified in such Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of such
Holder or its designee, for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled. If the number of Preferred Shares
represented by the Preferred Share Certificate(s) submitted for conversion pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) is greater than the number of
Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company shall, as soon as practicable and in no event later than two (2) Trading Days after
receipt of the Preferred Share Certificate(s) and at its own expense, issue and mail to such Holder (or its designee) by overnight courier
service a new Preferred Share Certificate or a new Book-Entry (in either case, in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the number
of Preferred Shares not converted. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion of Preferred
Shares shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Conversion Shares on the Conversion Date; provided,
that such Person shall be deemed to have waived any voting rights of any such Conversion Shares that may arise with respect to any record
date during the period commencing on such Conversion Date, through, and including, such applicable Share Delivery Deadline (each, an
 Conversion Period ), as necessary, such that the aggregate voting rights of any Common Stock (including such Conversion
Shares) beneficially owned by such Person and/or any of its Attribution Parties, collectively, on any such record date shall not exceed
the Maximum Percentage (as defined below) as a result of any such conversion of such applicable Preferred Shares with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder delivers a Conversion Notice to the Company prior to the date of issuance of Preferred Shares
to such Holder, whereby such Holder elects to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to such Conversion Notice, the Share Delivery Deadline
with respect to any such Conversion Notice shall be the later of (x) the date of issuance of such Preferred Shares and (y) the first
(1st) Trading Day after the date of such Conversion Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of
Designations or the Registration Rights Agreement, after the effective date of a Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration
Rights Agreement) and prior to a Holder s receipt of the notice of a Grace Period (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement),
the Company shall cause the Transfer Agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to such Holder (or its designee) in connection
with any sale of Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with respect to which such Holder has entered
into a contract for sale, and delivered a copy of the prospectus included as part of the particular Registration Statement to the extent
applicable, and for which such Holder has not yet settled. 

4 

(ii) Company s
Failure to Timely Convert . If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, on or prior to the applicable Share Delivery
Deadline, (I) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in FAST or the Resale Eligibility Conditions are not satisfied, to issue and
deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a certificate for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled and register
such Conversion Shares on the Company s share register or, (II) if the Transfer Agent is participating in FAST and the Resale Eligibility
Conditions are satisfied, to credit such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC for such number of Conversion
Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion of any Conversion Amount (as the case may be) (a Conversion
Failure ), and if on or after such Share Delivery Deadline such Holder acquires (in an open market transaction, stock loan
or otherwise) shares of Common Stock corresponding to all or any portion of the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon such conversion
that such Holder is entitled to receive from the Company and has not received from the Company in connection with such Conversion Failure
(a Buy-In ), then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, the Company shall, within two (2)
Business Days after receipt of such Holder s request and in such Holder s discretion, either: (I) pay cash to such Holder
in an amount equal to such Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, stock loan costs and other out-of-pocket
expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so acquired (including, without limitation, by any other Person in respect, or on behalf,
of such Holder) (the Buy-In Price ), at which point the Company s obligation to so issue and deliver such certificate
(and to issue such Conversion Shares) or credit to the balance account of such Holder or such Holder s designee, as applicable,
with DTC for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion hereunder (as the case
may be) (and to issue such Conversion Shares) shall terminate, or (II) promptly honor its obligation to so issue and deliver to such
Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Conversion Shares or credit the balance account of such Holder or such Holder s
designee, as applicable, with DTC for the number of Conversion Shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion
hereunder (as the case may be) and pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product
of (x) such number of shares of Common Stock multiplied by (y) the lowest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during
the period commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending on the date of such issuance and payment under this
clause (II) (each, a Buy-In Payment Amount ). Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive
relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing Conversion Shares (or to electronically
deliver such Conversion Shares) upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares as required pursuant to the terms hereof. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any given Conversion Failure, this Section 4(c)(ii) shall not apply to a Holder to the
extent the Company has already paid such amounts in full to such Holder with respect to such Notice Failure pursuant to the analogous
sections of the Securities Purchase Agreement. 

(iii) Registration;
Book-Entry . At the time of issuance of any Preferred Shares hereunder, the applicable Holder may, by written request (including by
electronic-mail) to the Company, elect to receive such Preferred Shares in the form of one or more Preferred Share Certificates or in
Book-Entry form. The Company (or the Transfer Agent, as custodian for the Preferred Shares) shall maintain a register (the Register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Holders of each Preferred Share and the Stated Value of the Preferred Shares and
whether the Preferred Shares are held by such Holder in Preferred Share Certificates or in Book-Entry form (the Registered
Preferred Shares ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The
Company and each Holder of the Preferred Shares shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Preferred
Share for all purposes (including, without limitation, the right to receive payments and Dividends hereunder) notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. A Registered Preferred Share may be assigned, transferred or sold only by registration of such assignment or sale on
the Register. Upon its receipt of a written request to assign, transfer or sell one or more Registered Preferred Shares by such Holder
thereof, the Company shall record the information contained therein in the Register and issue one or more new Registered Preferred Shares
in the same aggregate Stated Value as the Stated Value of the surrendered Registered Preferred Shares to the designated assignee or transferee
pursuant to Section 18, provided that if the Company does not so record an assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be) of such
Registered Preferred Shares within two (2) Business Days of such a request, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to
reflect such assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4,
following conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the applicable Holder shall not be required to physically
surrender such Preferred Shares held in the form of a Preferred Share Certificate to the Company unless (A) the full or remaining number
of Preferred Shares represented by the applicable Preferred Share Certificate are being converted (in which event such certificate(s)
shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(iii)) or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written
notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of the
applicable Preferred Share Certificate. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Stated Value and Dividends converted
and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) or shall use such other method,
reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of a Preferred Share Certificate upon
conversion. If the Company does not update the Register to record such Stated Value and Dividends converted and/or paid (as the case
may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) within two (2) Business Days of such occurrence, then
the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to reflect such occurrence. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records
of the Company establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling and determinative
in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge and agree that,
by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred Shares represented
by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each Preferred Share Certificate shall
bear the following legend: 

ANY
TRANSFEREE OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING
TO THE SHARES OF SERIES G CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(iii) THEREOF. THE NUMBER
OF SHARES OF SERIES G CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES G CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(iii) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE SHARES OF
SERIES G CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE. 

5 

(iv) Pro
Rata Conversion; Disputes . In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same Conversion
Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert from
each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted
for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to
the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of Conversion
Shares issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of
Conversion Shares not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. If a Conversion Notice delivered to the Company
would result in a breach of Section 4(d) below, and the applicable Holder does not elect in writing to withdraw, in whole, such Conversion
Notice, the Company shall hold such Conversion Notice in abeyance until such time as such Conversion Notice may be satisfied without
violating Section 4(d) below (with such calculations thereunder made as of the date such Conversion Notice was initially delivered to
the Company). 

(d) Limitation
on Beneficial Ownership . The Company shall not effect the conversion of any of the Preferred Shares held by a Holder, and such Holder
shall not have the right to convert any of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Certificate
of Designations and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after giving effect to
such conversion, such Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess of 4.99 (the
 Maximum Percentage of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and the other
Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties plus
 the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination of
such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted
Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised
or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes, convertible preferred
stock or warrants, including the Preferred Shares and the Warrants) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other Attribution Party
subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 4(d). For purposes of this Section
4(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the calculation
of the Maximum Percentage shall take into account the concurrent exercise and/or conversion, as applicable, of the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such Holder and/or any other Attribution Party, as applicable. For
purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion of such Preferred Shares
without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x)
the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public
filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other written notice by the
Company or the Transfer Agent, if any, setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the Reported Outstanding
Share Number ). If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify such Holder in writing of the number of
shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause such Holder s beneficial
ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(d), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify the Company of a reduced
number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice. For any reason at any time, upon the written or
oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including such Preferred Shares, by such Holder
and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that the
issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of such Preferred Shares results in such Holder and the other Attribution
Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such Holder s and the other
Attribution Parties aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the Excess Shares shall
be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess
Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective
until the sixty-first (61 st day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other
percentage not in excess of 9.99 as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not
be effective until the sixty-first (61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or
decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an Attribution Party
of such Holder. For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of
Designations in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Holder for any purpose including
for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to this
paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination
of convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity
with the terms of this Section 4(d) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be
defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 4(d) or to make changes or supplements
necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall
apply to a successor holder of such Preferred Shares.

(e) Mandatory
Conversion . 

(i) General .
If at any time (i) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal Market equals at least 300 of the Conversion Price
for twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days (each, a Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period ), and (ii) no Equity Conditions
Failure then exists, the Company shall have the right to require each Holder to convert all, or any number, of the Preferred Shares,
as designated in the Mandatory Conversion Notice (as defined below) into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof at the Conversion Rate as of the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined below) (a Mandatory
Conversion ). The Company may exercise its right to require conversion under this Section 4(e) by delivering within five (5)
Trading Days following the end of such Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period a written notice thereof by electronic mail and overnight
courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders and the Transfer Agent (the Mandatory Conversion Notice and
the date all of the Holders received such notice by electronic mail is referred to as the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date ).
The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable. The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall state (i) the Trading Day selected for the
Mandatory Conversion in accordance with this Section 4(e), which Trading Day shall be no less than two (2) Trading Days and no more than
fifteen (15) Trading Days following the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date (the Mandatory Conversion Date ), (ii) the
aggregate number of the Preferred Shares subject to mandatory conversion from each Holder pursuant to this Section 4(e), (iii) the number
of shares of Common Stock to be issued to such Holder on the Mandatory Conversion Date and (iv) that there has been no Equity Conditions
Failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may effect only one (1) Mandatory Conversion during any twenty (20) consecutive Trading
Days. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal Market
fails to exceed the Conversion Price by 300 for each Trading Day commencing on the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date and ending and including
the Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date (a Mandatory Conversion Price Failure or an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, (A) the Company shall provide each Holder
a subsequent notice to that effect and (B) unless such Holder waives the applicable Equity Conditions Failure and/or Mandatory Conversion
Price Failure, as applicable, the Mandatory Conversion shall be cancelled and the applicable Mandatory Conversion Notice of such Holder
shall be null and void and (ii) at any time prior to the date of consummation of the Mandatory Conversion the Preferred Shares subject
to such Mandatory Conversion may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Preferred Shares subject to a Mandatory Conversion may be converted by a Holder hereunder prior to
the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date and such aggregate number of Preferred Shares converted hereunder on or after the Mandatory
Conversion Notice Date and prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date shall reduce the aggregate number of Preferred Shares of such Holder
required to be converted on such Mandatory Conversion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no right to effect a Mandatory
Conversion if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing, but any Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s
right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. 

(ii) Pro
Rata Conversion Requirement . If the Company elects to cause a Mandatory Conversion of any Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section
4(e), then it must simultaneously take the same action in the same proportion with respect to all Holders of Preferred Shares. 

(f) Right
of Alternate Conversion Upon a Triggering Event . 

(i) General .
Subject to Section 4(d), at any time after the later of (A) the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement)
and (B) the earlier of a Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice (as defined below) and such Holder becoming aware of a Triggering
Event (such earlier date, the Alternate Conversion Right Commencement Date and ending (such ending date, the Alternate
Conversion Right Expiration Date , and each such period, an Alternate Conversion Right Period on the
twentieth (20 th Trading Day after the later of (x) the date such Triggering Event is cured and (y) such Holder s receipt
of a Triggering Event Notice that includes (I) a reasonable description of the applicable Triggering Event, (II) a certification as to
whether, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, such Triggering Event is capable of being cured and, if applicable, a reasonable description
of any existing plans of the Company to cure such Triggering Event and (III) a certification as to the date the Triggering Event occurred
and, if cured on or prior to the date of such Triggering Event Notice, the applicable Alternate Conversion Right Expiration Date, such
Holder may, at such Holder s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice to the Company (the date of any such Conversion Notice,
each an Alternate Conversion Date ), convert all, or any number of Preferred Shares held by such Holder into shares
of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, an Alternate Conversion ). 

(ii) Mechanics
of Alternate Conversion . On any Alternate Conversion Date, a Holder may voluntarily convert any number of Preferred Shares held by
such Holder pursuant to Section 4(c) (with Alternate Conversion Price replacing Conversion Price for all
purposes hereunder with respect to such Alternate Conversion and with the applicable Required Premium multiplied by the Conversion
Amount replacing Conversion Amount in clause (x) of the definition of Conversion Rate in Section 4(b) above with
respect to such Alternate Conversion) by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii) of this Certificate
of Designations that such Holder is electing to use the Alternate Conversion Price for such conversion. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 4(f)(ii), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Company delivers to such Holder the shares of Common Stock
to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to the applicable Alternate Conversion of such Holder s Preferred Shares, such Preferred
Shares may be converted by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(c) without regard to this Section 4(f)(ii).
In the event of an Alternate Conversion pursuant to this Section 4(f)(ii) of all, or any portion, of any Preferred Shares of a Holder,
such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest
rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly, any redemption
premium due under this Section 4(f)(ii), together the Alternate Conversion Price used in such Alternate Conversion, as applicable, is
intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of, such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity
and not as a penalty.

6. Rights
Upon Fundamental Transactions . 

(a) Assumption .
The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the Successor Entity assumes in writing all of the obligations
of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section
6 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, including agreements to deliver
to each holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for such Preferred Shares a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument
substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of Designations, including, without limitation, having a stated value
and dividend rate equal to the stated value and dividend rate of the Preferred Shares held by the Holders and having similar ranking
to the Preferred Shares, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the
Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions
of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company shall refer instead to
the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under
this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named
as the Company herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity
shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares at any time
after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other
property (except such items still issuable under Sections 7 and 15, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon
the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly traded common
stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) which each Holder would have been entitled to receive
upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior
to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate
of Designations), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 6 to permit the Fundamental
Transaction without the assumption of the Preferred Shares. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly and equally to successive
Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares. 

12 

(b) Notice
of a Change of Control; Change of Control Election Notice . No sooner than the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Trading Days prior to the
consummation of a Change of Control or (y) the public announcement of the entry into an agreement with respect to a Change of Control,
nor later than ten (10) Trading Days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control (the Change of Control Date ),
the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (a Change of Control
Notice ). At any time during the period beginning after a Holder s receipt of a Change of Control Notice or such Holder
becoming aware of a Change of Control if a Change of Control Notice is not delivered to such Holder in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence (as applicable) and ending on twenty (20) Trading Days after the later of (A) the date of consummation of such Change
of Control or (B) the date of receipt of such Change of Control Notice or (C) the date of the announcement of such Change of Control,
such Holder may require, by delivering written notice thereof Change of Control Election Notice to the Company
(which Change of Control Election Notice shall indicate the number of Preferred Shares subject to such election), to have the Company
exchange such Holder s Preferred Shares designated in such Change of Control Election Notice for consideration equal to the Change
of Control Election Price (as defined below), to be satisfied at the Company s election (such election to pay in cash or by delivery
of the Rights (as defined below), a Consideration Election ), in either (I) rights (with a beneficial ownership limitation
in the form of Section 4(d) hereof, mutatis mutandis (collectively, the Rights ), convertible in whole, or
in part, at any time, without the requirement to pay any additional consideration, at the option of the Required Holders, into such Corporate
Event Consideration (as defined below) applicable to such Change of Control equal in value to the Change of Control Election Price, or
(II) in cash. The Company shall give each Holder written notice of each Consideration Election at least ten (10) Trading Days prior to
the time of consummation of such Change of Control. Payment of such amounts or delivery of the Rights, as applicable, shall be made by
the Company (or at the Company s direction) to each Holder on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Trading Day after the date of such
request and (y) the date of consummation of such Change of Control (or, with respect to any Right, if applicable, such later time that
holders of shares of Common Stock are initially entitled to receive Corporate Event Consideration with respect to the shares of Common
Stock of such holder). Any Corporate Event Consideration included in the Rights, if any, pursuant to this Section 6(b) is pari passu
 with the Corporate Event Consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Common Stock and the Company shall not permit a payment
of any Corporate Event Consideration to the holders of shares of Common Stock without on or prior to such time delivering the Right to
the Holders in accordance herewith. Cash payments, if any, required by this Section 6(b) shall have priority to payments to all other
stockholders of the Company in connection with such Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(b),
but subject to Section 4(d), until the applicable Change of Control Election Price is paid in full to the applicable Holder in cash or
Corporate Event Consideration in accordance herewith, the Preferred Shares submitted by such Holder for exchange or payment, as applicable,
under this Section 6(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4 or in the event
the Conversion Date is after the consummation of such Change of Control, stock or equity interests of the Successor Entity substantially
equivalent to the Company s shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 6. In the event of the Company s repayment or exchange,
as applicable, of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 6(b), such Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to
estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable
substitute investment opportunity for a Holder. Accordingly, any Required Premium due under this Section 6(b) is intended by the parties
to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in connection with any redemption hereunder at a time a Holder is entitled to receive
a cash payment under any of the other Transaction Documents, at the option of such Holder delivered in writing to the Company, the applicable
redemption price hereunder shall be increased by the amount of such cash payment owed to such Holder under such other Transaction Document
and, upon payment in full or conversion in accordance herewith, shall satisfy the Company s payment obligation under such other
Transaction Document. 

7. Rights
Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events . 

(a) Purchase
Rights . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 8 and Section 15 below, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells
any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all or substantially
all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder will be entitled
to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if
such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares (without taking
into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that all the
Preferred Shares were converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) held by such Holder immediately prior
to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date
as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights; provided,
however, to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in such Holder and the other
Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to
such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of
such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held
in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision, such term shall be extended
by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable) for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times, if ever, as its right
thereto would not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times such
Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase Right or on any subsequent
Purchase Right held similarly in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision,
such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable)) to the same extent as if there had been no such
limitation. 

13 

(b) Other
Corporate Events . In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental
Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or
in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure
that each Holder will thereafter have the right, at such Holder s option, to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred Shares
held by such Holder (i) such securities or other assets (the Corporate Event Consideration to which such Holder
would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such Holder upon the
consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred
Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion,
such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate
Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder initially been
issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such
consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate of an Alternate Conversion. Provision made pursuant the preceding sentence shall
be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly and
equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of the
Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations. 

8. Rights
Upon Issuance of Other Securities . 

(a) Adjustment
of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock . If and whenever on or after the Subscription Date the Company grants, issues or
sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell), or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have granted, issued
or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the granting, issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account
of the Company, but excluding any Excluded Securities granted, issued or sold or deemed to have been granted, issued or sold) for a consideration
per share (the New Issuance Price less than a price equal to the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such granting, issuance or sale or deemed granting, issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect is referred to herein as the
 Applicable Price (the foregoing a Dilutive Issuance ), then, immediately after such Dilutive
Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price. For all purposes of the
foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under this Section 8(a)),
the following shall be applicable: 

(i) Issuance
of Options . If the Company in any manner grants, issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell) any Options
and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the
terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued
and sold by the Company at the time of the granting, issuance or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section
8(a)(i), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such
Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received
or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise
of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for which one share of Common Stock is issuable
(or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, minus (2)
the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Option (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock
upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible
Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof plus the value of any other consideration (including,
without limitation, consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or any other property) received or receivable by, or benefit
conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion
Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such
Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof or upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise
or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

14 

(ii) Issuance
of Convertible Securities . If the Company in any manner issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to issue or sell) any Convertible
Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion, exercise or
exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall
be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale (or the time of execution
of such agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this
Section 8(a)(ii), the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the
lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon the issuance
or sale (or pursuant to the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of the Convertible Security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange
of such Convertible Security or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such Convertible
Security for which one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder
of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale (or the agreement
to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Security plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable (including,
without limitation, any consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or other property) by, or benefit conferred on, the
holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price
shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities
or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of
any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 8(a),
except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issuance or sale. 

(iii) Change
in Option Price or Rate of Conversion . If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible
Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time (other than
proportional changes in conversion or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in Section 8(a) below),
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been
in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional
consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes
of this Section 8(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (including, without limitation, any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the Subscription Date) are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding
sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(a)
shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. 

(iv) Calculation
of Consideration Received . If any Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right is issued in connection with the issuance
or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (as determined by the Holder, the Primary Security ,
and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the Secondary Securities and together with
the Primary Security, each a Unit ), together comprising one integrated transaction, the aggregate consideration
per share of Common Stock with respect to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be the lower of (x) the purchase price of such Unit,
(y) if such Primary Security is an Option and/or Convertible Security, the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock
is at any time issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Primary Security in accordance with 8(a)(i) or 8(a)(ii) and (z) the lowest
VWAP of the shares of Common Stock on any Trading Day during the five (5) Trading Day period (the Adjustment Period immediately following the public announcement of such Dilutive Issuance (for the avoidance of doubt, if such public announcement is released
prior to the opening of the Principal Market on a Trading Day, such Trading Day shall be the first Trading Day in such five Trading Day
period and if any Preferred Shares are exercised, on any given Conversion Date during any such Adjustment Period, solely with respect
to such number of Preferred Shares converted on such applicable Conversion Date, such applicable Adjustment Period shall be deemed to
have ended on, and included, the Trading Day immediately prior to such Conversion Date). If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be
the net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are
issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the fair value of
such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration
received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the five (5) Trading
Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners
of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor
will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to
such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities (as the case may be). The fair value of any consideration other than cash
or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required Holder. If such parties are unable to reach
agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the Valuation Event ), the fair
value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10 th day following such Valuation
Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holder. The determination of such appraiser
shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. 

15 

(v) Record
Date . If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend
or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase shares
of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the
shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution
or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). 

(b) Adjustment
of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision of Section 7 or Section 15, if
the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization
or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision of Section 7 or
Section 15, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination,
recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant
to this Section 8(b) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring
an adjustment under this Section 8(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation
of such Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c) Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by rounding to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100 th of a share, as
applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account
of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 

(d) Voluntary
Adjustment by Company . Subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market and Section 8(g) below, the Company may at any
time any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, with the prior written consent of the Required Holder, reduce the then current Conversion
Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board. 

(e) Adjustments .
If on any of the tenth (10th) Trading Day after the Applicable Date, (ii) the ninetieth (90th) calendar day after the Applicable Date
or (iii) the one hundred and eightieth (180th) calendar day after the Applicable Date, as applicable (the Adjustment Date ),
the Conversion Price then in effect is greater than the Market Price then in effect (the Adjustment Price ), on the
Adjustment Date the Conversion Price shall automatically lower to the Adjustment Price. 

16 

(f) Exchange
Right . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates any Subsequent Placement
(other than with respect to Excluded Securities), and a Holder elects in writing to the Company to participate in such Subsequent Placement,
each such Holder may, at the option of such Holder as elected in writing to the Company, exchange all, or any part, of the Preferred
Shares of such Holder into the securities in such Subsequent Placement (with the aggregate amount of such securities to be issued in
such exchange equal to such aggregate amount of such securities with a purchase price valued at 120 of the Conversion Amount of the
Preferred Shares delivered by such Holder in exchange therefor). 

(g) Conversion
Floor Price . Prior to the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), no adjustment pursuant to
this Section 8 shall cause the Conversion Price to be less than 1.57 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination,
reclassification or similar transaction occurring after the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement) (the Conversion Floor
Price ). As of the Stockholder Approval Date, any Dilutive Issuances or other events that would have resulted in an adjustment
to the Conversion Price prior to the Stockholder Approval Date, but for the application of this Section 8(g), shall adjust the Conversion
Price hereunder as if such Dilutive Issuances and/or other events, as applicable, occurred on the Stockholder Approval Date. 

9. Redemption
at the Company s Election . At any time, the Company shall have the right to redeem all, or any number, of the Preferred Shares
then outstanding (the Company Optional Redemption Amount on the Company Optional Redemption Date (each as defined
below) (a Company Optional Redemption ). The Preferred Shares subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 9 shall
be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price (the Company Optional Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i)
120 of the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date and (ii) the product of (1) the Conversion Rate
with respect to the Conversion Amount being redeemed as of the Company Optional Redemption Date multiplied by (2) the greatest Closing
Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding such Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date and ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date the Company makes the entire payment required to be
made under this Section 9. The Company may exercise its right to require redemption under this Section 9 by delivering a written notice
thereof by electronic mail and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the Holders (the Company Optional Redemption
Notice and the date all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the Company Optional Redemption Notice
Date ). Such Company Optional Redemption Notice may be conditioned upon the consummation of an offering of securities of the
Company or a Going Private Transaction. The Company Optional Redemption Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Optional
Redemption shall occur (the Company Optional Redemption Date which date shall not be less than two (2) Trading
Days nor more than twenty (20) Trading Days following the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date, and (y) state the aggregate Conversion
Amount of the Preferred Shares which is being redeemed in such Company Optional Redemption from such Holder and all of the other Holders
of the Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 9 on the Company Optional Redemption Date. The Company shall deliver the applicable
Company Optional Redemption Price to each Holder in cash on the applicable Company Optional Redemption Date. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the date the Company Optional Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Company Optional Redemption
Amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4. All Conversion Amounts
converted by a Holder after the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date shall reduce the Company Optional Redemption Amount of the Preferred
Shares of such Holder required to be redeemed on the Company Optional Redemption Date. In the event of the Company s redemption
of any of the Preferred Shares under this Section 9, a Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of
the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment
opportunity for such Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium due under this Section 9 is intended by the parties to be, and shall
be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company shall have no right to effect a Company Optional Redemption if any Triggering Event has occurred and continuing,
but any Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to a Going Private Transaction, the Company may effect a Company Optional Redemption under this Section 9,
but with Change of Control Election Price replacing Company Optional Redemption Price for all purposes in
this Section 9 in connection therewith. 

17 

10. Noncircumvention .
The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws or through
any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any
other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate of Designations,
and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all action as may be required
to protect the rights of the Holders hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of this Certificate
of Designations or the other Transaction Documents, the Company (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable
upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the
conversion of Preferred Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and
keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred
Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of the Preferred
Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
if after the sixty (60) calendar day anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder is not permitted to convert such Holder s
Preferred Shares in full for any reason (other than pursuant to restrictions set forth in Section 4(d) hereof), the Company shall use
its best efforts to promptly remedy such failure, including, without limitation, obtaining such consents or approvals as necessary to
effect such conversion into shares of Common Stock. 

11. Authorized
Shares . 

(a) Reservation .
So long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company shall at all times reserve at least 200 of the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion, including without limitation, Alternate Conversions,
of all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding at the Alternate Conversion Price then in effect (without regard to any limitations on
conversions) (the Required Reserve Amount ). The Required Reserve Amount (including, without limitation, each increase
in the number of shares so reserved) shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of the Preferred Shares held by
each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the Authorized Share
Allocation ). In the event that a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder s Preferred Shares, each
transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder s Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved
and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders of Preferred Shares,
pro rata based on the number of the Preferred Shares then held by the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may allocate its
Authorized Share Allocation to any other of the securities of the Company held by such Holder (or any of its designees) by delivery of
a written notice to the Company. 

(b) Insufficient
Authorized Shares . If, notwithstanding Section 11 (a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while any of the Preferred Shares
remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation
to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve
Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the
Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount
for the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the
date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such Authorized
Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares
of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its
best efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board
of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal (or, if a majority of the voting power then in effect of
the capital stock of the Company consents to such increase, in lieu of such proxy statement, deliver to the stockholders of the Company
an information statement that has been filed with (and either approved by or not subject to comments from) the SEC with respect thereto).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any such time of an Authorized Share Failure, the Company is able to obtain the written consent
of a majority of the shares of its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock to approve the increase in the number of authorized
shares of Common Stock, the Company may satisfy this obligation by obtaining such consent and submitting for filing with the SEC an Information
Statement on Schedule 14C. Nothing contained in Section 11(a) or this Section 11(b) shall limit any obligations of the Company under
any provision of the Securities Purchase Agreement or Registration Rights Agreement. 

18 

12. Voting
Rights . The holders of the Preferred Shares shall have no voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time, either as
a separate series or class or together with any other series or class of share of capital stock, and shall not be entitled to call a
meeting of such holders for any purpose nor shall they be entitled to participate in any meeting of the holders of Common Stock, except
as provided in this Section 12 and Section 16 or as otherwise required by the DGCL. To the extent that under the DGCL the vote of the
holders of the Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given action of the
Company, the affirmative vote or consent of the Required Holders of the Preferred Shares, voting together in the aggregate and not in
separate series unless required under the DGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is presented or by written consent
of the Required Holders (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate series
unless required under the DGCL, shall constitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable. Holders
of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to written notice of all stockholder meetings or written consents (and copies of proxy materials
and other information sent to stockholders) with respect to which they would be entitled to vote, which notice would be provided pursuant
to the Company s bylaws (the Bylaws and the DGCL.

such qualification necessary, except where the failure to become or remain duly qualified or in good standing could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

19 

(a) Transactions
with Affiliates . The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into, renew, extend or be a party to,
any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, lease, transfer or exchange of

of business in a manner and to an extent consistent with past practice and necessary or desirable for the prudent operation of its business,
for fair consideration and on terms no less favorable to it or its Subsidiaries than would be obtainable in a comparable arm s
length transaction with a Person that is not an affiliate thereof. 

(b) Restricted
Issuances . The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Required Holders, (i) issue any
Preferred Shares (other than as contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement and this Certificate of Designations), or (ii) issue

Oversight Board. 

(d)
 Independent Investigation . At the request of the Required Holders either (x) at any time when a Triggering Event has occurred
and is continuing, (y) upon the occurrence of an event that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute a Triggering
Event or (z) at any time such Required Holders reasonably believe a Triggering Event may have occurred or be continuing, the Company
shall hire an independent, reputable investment bank selected by the Company and approved by such Holder (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to investigate as to whether any breach of this Certificate of Designations has occurred (the Independent
Investigator ). If the Independent Investigator determines that such breach of this Certificate of Designations has occurred,
the Independent Investigator shall notify the Company of such breach and the Company shall deliver written notice to each Holder of such
breach. In connection with such investigation, the Independent Investigator may, during normal business hours, inspect all contracts,
books, records, personnel, offices and other facilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the extent available
to the Company after the Company uses reasonable efforts to obtain them, the records of its legal advisors and accountants and any books
of account, records, reports and other papers not contractually required of the Company to be confidential or secret, or subject to attorney-client
or other evidentiary privilege, and the Independent Investigator may make such copies and inspections thereof as the Independent Investigator
may reasonably request. The Company shall furnish the Independent Investigator with such financial and operating data and other information
with respect to the business and properties of the Company as the Independent Investigator may reasonably request. The Company shall
permit the Independent Investigator to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Company with, and to make proposals and furnish
advice with respect thereto to, the Company s officers, directors, key employees and independent public accountants or any of them

14. Liquidation,
Dissolution, Winding-Up . In the event of a Liquidation Event, the Holders shall be entitled to receive in cash out of the assets
of the Company, whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders (the Liquidation Funds ),
before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of shares of Junior Stock, but pari passu with any Parity Stock then outstanding,
an amount per Preferred Share equal to the greater of (A) 120 of the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Share on the date of such payment
and (B) the amount per share such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Share into Common Stock immediately prior
to the date of such payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the Holders and holders
of shares of Parity Stock, then each Holder and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of the Liquidation Funds equal
to the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to such Holder and such holder of Parity Stock as a liquidation preference, in accordance
with their respective certificate of designations (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to
all holders of Preferred Shares and all holders of shares of Parity Stock. To the extent necessary, the Company shall cause such actions
to be taken by each of its Subsidiaries so as to enable, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the proceeds of a Liquidation Event
to be distributed to the Holders in accordance with this Section 14. All the preferential amounts to be paid to the Holders under this
Section 14 shall be paid or set apart for payment before the payment or setting apart for payment of any amount for, or the distribution

of capital or otherwise (including without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way
of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (the Distributions ),
then each Holder, as holders of Preferred Shares, will be entitled to such Distributions as if such Holder had held the number of shares
of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Preferred Shares (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions
on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that the Preferred Share was converted at the Alternate Conversion
Price as of the applicable record date) immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for such Distribution or, if no such
record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for such Distributions provided ,
 however , that to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution would result in such Holder
and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution
to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result
of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held
in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and the other
Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times, if any, such Holder shall be granted such Distribution
(and any Distributions declared or made on such initial Distribution or on any subsequent Distribution held similarly in abeyance) to
the same extent as if there had been no such limitation). 

21

provided for the benefit of the Preferred Shares hereunder, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized
number of shares of Series G Convertible Preferred Stock; (c) without limiting any provision of Section 2, create or authorize (by reclassification
or otherwise) any new class or series of Senior Preferred Stock or Parity Stock; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any shares of Junior

such plans (that have in good faith been approved by the Board)); (e) without limiting any provision of Section 2, pay dividends or make
any other distribution on any shares of any Junior Stock; (f) issue any Preferred Shares other than as contemplated hereby or pursuant
to the Securities Purchase Agreement; or (g) without limiting any provision of Section 14, whether or not prohibited by the terms of
the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares hereunder. 

17. Transfer
of Preferred Shares . A Holder may offer, sell or transfer some or all of its Preferred Shares without the consent of the Company
subject only to the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Purchase Agreement. 

18. Reissuance
of Preferred Share Certificates and Book Entries . 

(a) Transfer .

harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event

court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to
apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not
affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Certificate of Designations so long as this Certificate of Designations as so
modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the
prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not substantially impair the respective expectations
or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties.

the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s).
