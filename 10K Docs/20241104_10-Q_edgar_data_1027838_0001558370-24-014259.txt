 Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of approximately million, after deducting underwriting discounts and approximately million of transaction expenses. On February 27, 2023, we closed on a public offering of shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share. We received net proceeds from this offering of million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. Our business is affected by seasonality. In the first quarter of each year, when most patients have started a new insurance year and have not yet met their annual out-of-pocket payment obligations, we experience substantially reduced demand for our products. We typically experience higher revenue in the third and fourth quarters of the year when patients have met their annual insurance deductibles, thereby reducing their out-of-pocket costs for our products, and because patients desire to exhaust their flexible spending accounts at year end. This seasonality applies only to purchases and rentals of our products by patients covered by commercial insurance and is not relevant to Medicare, Medicaid or the Veterans Administration, as those payers either do not have plans that have declining deductibles over the course of the plan year and/or do not have plans that include patient deductibles for purchases or rentals of our products.

 million incremental term loan to the million revolving credit facility provided by the Restated Credit Agreement. The term loan is reflected on our condensed consolidated financial statements as a note payable. The Credit Agreement provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may increase the amount of the revolving loans available under the Credit Agreement and/or add one or more term loan facilities in an amount not to exceed million in the aggregate, such that the total aggregate principal amount of loans available under the Credit Agreement (including under the revolving credit facility) does not exceed million. On September 8, 2021, in connection with the closing of the AffloVest Acquisition, we borrowed the million term loan and utilized that borrowing, together with a draw of million under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the purchase price. On February 22, 2022, we entered into a Second Amendment Agreement (the Second Amendment ), which further amended the Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment modified the maximum leverage ratio, the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum consolidated EBITDA covenants under the Credit Agreement, and added a minimum liquidity covenant, through the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The Second Amendment also increased the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans under the Credit Agreement during the period commencing on the date of the Second Amendment and ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, we made a mandatory principal prepayment of the term loan of million on February 22, 2022. On June 21, 2023, we entered into a Third Amendment Agreement (the Third Amendment that replaced the interest rate benchmark under the Credit Agreement from LIBOR to the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). All tenors of term SOFR are subject to a credit spread adjustment of Adjusted Term SOFR ). Following the Third Amendment, the term loan and amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (a) the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus and (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR for a one-month tenor plus (the Base Rate plus an applicable margin or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR for an interest period of one, three or six months, at our option, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin is to on loans bearing interest at the Base Rate and to on loans bearing interest at Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case depending on our consolidated total leverage ratio; except that, pursuant to the Second Amendment and the Third Amendment, during the period commencing on February 22, 2022 and ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023, the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans and Adjusted Term SOFR loans, as applicable, was . On August 1, 2023, we entered into a Fourth Amendment Agreement (the Fourth Amendment ), which further amended the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment, among other things, decreased the commitment fees payable under the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement such that the undrawn portions of the revolving credit facility are subject to an unused line fee at a rate per annum from to , depending on our consolidated leverage ratio, and eliminated the language providing that the applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR loans was , such that the interest rates are in effect as set forth in the above paragraph. The Fourth Amendment also eliminated the liquidity financial covenant and modified the remaining financial covenants to reflect the termination of the temporary covenant relief period that was in place until June 30, 2023 pursuant to the Second Amendment, such that the financial covenants now include a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant, a minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. In addition, the Fourth Amendment provided for an

 million, which we used for a paydown of the revolving credit facility. The Fourth Amendment also extended the maturity date of the term loans and revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement from September 8, 2024, to August 1, 2026. On November 1, 2024, we entered into a Fifth Amendment Agreement (the Fifth Amendment ), which further amended the Credit Agreement. The Fifth Amendment permits the Company to make payments to repurchase shares of its common stock, as long as the Company is not in default before and after giving effect to such repurchases, and as long as such repurchases do not exceed million . On December 21, 2023, we made a payment of million to repay in full the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of million under the Credit Agreement, comprised entirely of the term loan. At September 30, 2024, all outstanding borrowings were subject to interest at a rate calculated at Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, for an interest rate of . The principal of the term loan is required to be repaid in installments of . Maturities of the term loan for the next three years as of September 30, 2024, were as follows: 2025 2026 Total Less: Deferred financing fees ) Net Note Payable Less: Current portion of note payable ) Non-current portion of note payable Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our and our subsidiary s assets and are also guaranteed by our subsidiary. As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Agreement contained a number of restrictions and covenants, including that we maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. , and determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. In general, an arrangement contains a lease if there is an identified asset and we have the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the identified asset. We record an operating lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the lease term on the commencement date. The related right of use ROU operating lease asset reflects rental escalation clauses, as well as renewal options and/or termination options. The exercise of lease renewal and/or termination options are at our discretion and are included in the determination of the lease term and lease payment obligations when it is deemed reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. When available, we use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, certain leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. We classify our leases as buildings, vehicles or computer and office equipment and do not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for any of the aforementioned classifications. In accordance with applicable guidance, we do not record leases with terms that are less than one year on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 as of September 30, 2024. We entered into a lease initial lease in October 2018, for approximately square feet of office space for our new corporate headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In December 2018, we amended the initial lease to add approximately square feet of additional office space, which is accounted for as a separate lease second lease in accordance with ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASC 842 ). In December 2019, we further amended the lease which extended the expiration date of the initial lease, extended the expiration date of and added approximately square feet to the second lease, as well as added approximately square feet of additional office space, accounted for as a separate lease third lease in accordance with ASC 842. The portion of the space covered under the initial lease was placed in service in September 2019. The portion of the space covered under the second lease commenced in September 2020. Finally, the portion of the space covered under the third lease commenced in September 2021. The three portions were recognized as an operating lease and included in the ROU operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Computer and Office Equipment We also have operating lease agreements for certain computer and office equipment. The remaining lease terms as of September 30, 2024, ranged from less than to approximately with fixed monthly payments that are included in the ROU operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities. The leases provide an option to purchase the related equipment at fair market value at the end of the lease. The leases will automatically as a month-to-month rental at the end of the lease if the equipment is not purchased or returned.

 million for goods that we expect to receive within the next year. Retirement Plan We maintain a 401(k) retirement plan for our employees in which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their pre-tax compensation.

Legal Proceedings F rom time to time, we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. On May 24, 2022, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of our present and former officers and directors and the Company (as a nominal defendant), captioned Jack Weaver v. Moen, et al., File No. 0:22-cv-01403-NEB-BRT (the Weaver Lawsuit ). The Weaver Lawsuit generally arises out of the same subject matter as a previously settled securities class action captioned Brian Mart v. Tactile Sys. Tech., Inc., et al., File No. 0:20-cv-02074-NEB-BRT (D. Minn.) (the Mart Lawsuit ), which alleged, inter alia, that we and of our former officers and directors made materially false or misleading statements about our business, operational and compliance policies. The Weaver Lawsuit alleges the following claims under the Exchange Act and common law: (1) that the director defendants made materially false or misleading public statements in proxy statements in violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act; (2) that the director defendants stock and option awards should be rescinded under Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act; (3) that the officer defendants employment contract compensation should be rescinded under Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act; (4) that certain officer defendants are liable for contribution arising out of any liability incurred in the Mart Lawsuit, under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act; (5) that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties; and (6) that the individual defendants were unjustly enriched. The Weaver Lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. In August 2022, the matter was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by order granting the Parties Stipulation to Transfer. On February 10, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss the action. The plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on March 3, 2023. On March 31, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. On July 31, 2023, the plaintiff filed a Joint Notice of Preliminary Settlement indicating that the parties had reached a non-binding settlement-in-principal on most of the material terms that would resolve all claims between the parties and requested that the Court temporarily stay all deadlines, hearings, and conferences while the parties continued to finalize settlement. On June 6, 2024, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Settlement in the Weaver Lawsuit. On June 7, 2024, the plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On June 27, 2024, the Court entered an order granting the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. The final settlement hearing occurred on August 28, 2024, and on September 4, 2024, the Court entered its order approving the settlement, including the agreed upon attorneys fees and expense awards to plaintiffs counsel and service awards to the shareholder plaintiffs. Pursuant to the settlement, we are adopting, implementing, and maintaining certain corporate governance reforms. The attorneys fees and expense award of approximately million was covered by insurance and has been paid. The settlement does not constitute an admission of liability or wrongdoing by us or any of our current or former directors or officers. This matter is now concluded. On October 25, 2024, the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston) unsealed two qui tam complaints against us. The first complaint is captioned United States ex. rel. Benjaman Scarborough vs. Tactile Systems Technology, Inc., Case No. 1:21-cv-10813-IT, and was filed under seal on May 17, 2021, on behalf of the United States by a former employee (the Scarborough Complaint ). The Scarborough Complaint alleges that we submitted false claims and made false statements in connection with the Medicare

 shares of our common stock initially reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2016 Plan. The 2016 Plan provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the 2016 Plan will automatically increase annually on January 1 of each calendar year, commencing in 2017 and ending on and including January 1, 2026, by an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) of the number of common shares of stock outstanding as of December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (b) shares; provided, however, that our Board of Directors may determine that any annual increase be a lesser number. In addition, all awards granted under our 2007 Omnibus Stock Plan and our 2003 Stock Option Plan that were outstanding when the 2016 Plan became effective and that are forfeited, expired, cancelled, settled for cash or otherwise not issued, will become available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase feature of the 2016 Plan, shares were added as available for issuance thereunder on January 1, 2024. Our Board of Directors exercised its prerogative to forego the automatic increase on January 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, shares were available for future grant pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Upon adoption and approval of the 2016 Plan, all of our previous equity incentive compensation plans were terminated. However, existing awards under those plans continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedules and will expire at the end of their original terms. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This expense was allocated as follows: Sales and marketing expenses Research and development expenses Reimbursement, general and administrative expenses Total stock-based compensation expense Stock Options Stock options issued to participants other than non-employees typically vest over three or and typically have a contractual term of seven or .

 Airway clearance products Total Percentage of total revenue Lymphedema products Airway clearance products Total Our revenue by channel, inclusive of sales and rental revenue, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are summarized in the following table: Veterans Administration Medicare Durable medical equipment distributors Total Our rental revenue is derived from rent-to-purchase arrangements that typically range from three to . As title transfers to the patient, with whom we have the contract, upon the termination of the lease term and because collectability is probable, under ASC 842, these are recognized as sales-type leases. Each rental agreement contains two components, the controller and related garments, both of which are interdependent and recognized as one lease component. The revenue and associated cost of revenue of sales-type leases are recognized on the lease commencement date and a net investment in leases is recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We bill the patients insurance payers monthly over the duration of the rental term. We record the net investment in leases and recognize revenue upon commencement of the lease in the amount of the expected consideration to be received through the monthly payments. Similar to our sales revenue, the transaction price is impacted by multiple factors, including the terms and conditions contracted by third-party payers. As the rental contract resides with the patients, we have elected the portfolio approach, at the payer level, to determine the expected consideration, which considers the impact of early terminations. While the contract is with the patient, in certain circumstances, the third-party payer elects an initial rental period with an option to extend. We assess the likelihood of extending the lease at the onset of the lease to determine if the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. As the lease is short-term in nature, we anticipate collection of substantially all of the net investment within the first year of the lease agreement. Completion of these payments represents the fair market value of the equipment, and as such, interest income is not applicable.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Overview We are a medical technology company that develops and provides innovative medical devices for the treatment of underserved chronic diseases. Our mission is to help people suffering from chronic diseases live better and care for themselves at home. We focus our efforts on advancing the standard of care in treating underserved chronic diseases in the home setting to improve patient outcomes and quality of life and help control rising healthcare expenditures. Our areas of therapeutic focus are (1) vascular disease, with a goal of advancing the standard of care in treating lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency, (2) oncology, where lymphedema is a common consequence among cancer survivors and (3) providing airway clearance therapy for those suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. We possess a unique, scalable platform to deliver at-home healthcare solutions throughout the United States. This evolving home care delivery model is recognized by policymakers and insurance payers as a key for controlling rising healthcare costs. Our solutions deliver cost-effective, clinically proven, long-term treatment for people with these chronic diseases. Our current lymphedema products are the Flexitouch Plus, Entre Plus and Nimbl systems and our airway clearance product is the AffloVest. A predecessor to our Flexitouch system received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA in July 2002, and we introduced the system to address the many limitations of self-administered home-based manual lymphatic drainage therapy. We began selling our more advanced Flexitouch system after receiving 510(k) clearance from the FDA in October 2006. In September 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch system in treating lymphedema of the head and neck. In June 2017, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch Plus, the third-generation version of our Flexitouch system. In December 2020, we received 510(k) clearance for two new indications for our Flexitouch Plus system: phlebolymphedema and lipedema. We introduced our Entre system in the United States in February 2013 and the second generation, Entre Plus, in March 2023. The Entre Plus system is sold or rented to patients who need a simple pump or who do not yet qualify for insurance reimbursement for an advanced compression device such as our Flexitouch Plus system. Nimbl, our next-generation pneumatic compression platform, received 510(k) clearance in June 2024 and, beginning in October 2024, is commercially available throughout the United States for the treatment of upper extremity lymphedema. Sales and rentals of our lymphedema products represented 88 of our revenue in each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. On September 8, 2021, we acquired the assets of the AffloVest airway clearance product line. AffloVest is a portable, wearable vest that provides airway clearance to treat patients with chronic respiratory conditions such as bronchiectasis or conditions resulting from neuromuscular disorders. For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sales of AffloVest represented 12 of our revenue. To support the growth of our business, we continue to invest in our commercial infrastructure, consisting of our direct sales force, training resources, reimbursement capabilities and clinical expertise. We market our lymphedema products in the United States using a direct-to-patient and -provider model. The AffloVest device is sold through respiratory durable medical equipment providers throughout the United States that service patients and bill third-party payers for the product. We also employ a small group of respiratory specialists, who educate DME representatives, provide product demonstrations for targeted clinicians and support technical questions related to the AffloVest. As of September 30, 2024, we employed 270 field sales representatives for our lymphedema products and a team of 19 supporting our airway clearance products. This compares to 246 field sales representatives for our lymphedema products and a team of 13 specialists supporting our airway clearance products as of September 30, 2023. We invest in our reimbursement function to improve operational efficiencies and enhance individual payer expertise, while continuing our strategic focus of payer development. Our payer relations function focuses on payer policy development, education, contract negotiations, and data analysis. Our reimbursement

 operations function is responsible for verifying patient insurance benefits, individual patient case development, prior authorization submissions, case follow-up, and appeals when necessary. We also have a clinical team, consisting of a scientific advisory board, in-house therapists and nurses, and a Chief Medical Officer, that serves as a resource to clinicians and patients and guides the development of clinical evidence in support of our products. Most clinical studies require observation and interaction with clinicians and patients to monitor results and progress. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers for the sourcing of parts, the assembly of our controllers and the manufacturing of the garments used with our systems. We conduct final assembly of the garments used with our products, perform quality assurance and ship our products from our facility in Minnesota. We also manufacture and ship the AffloVest device from our Minnesota-based facility. I n July 2022, we launched Kylee a free mobile app that makes it easier for patients to manage their conditions by tracking treatments and symptoms, as well as having direct access to educational resources. Flexitouch Plus and Nimbl devices include Bluetooth technology, which is viewable using Kylee. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue of 73.1 million and had net income of 5.2 million, compared to revenue of 69.6 million and net income of 22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue of 207.4 million and had net income of 7.2 million, compared to revenue of 196.8 million and net income of 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our primary sources of capital since our initial public offering in 2016 have been from operating income, bank financing and our public offering in February 2023. We operate in one segment for financial reporting purposes. Current Economic Conditions General global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, increased unemployment and economic slowdown or recession, may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and exacerbate some of the other risks that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is affected by seasonality. In the first quarter of each year, when most patients have started a new insurance year and have not yet met their annual out-of-pocket payment obligations, we experience substantially reduced demand for our products. We typically experience higher revenue in the third and fourth quarters of the year when patients have met their annual insurance deductibles, thereby reducing their out-of-pocket costs for our products, and have an increasing desire to exhaust their flexible spending accounts at year end. This seasonality applies only to purchases and rentals of our products by patients covered by commercial insurance and is not relevant to Medicare, Medicaid or the Veterans Administration, as those payers either do not have plans that have declining deductibles over the course of the plan year and/or do not have plans that include patient deductibles for purchases or rentals of our products. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue decreased 1.9 million, or 9 , to 18.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue decreased 2.6 million, or 4 , to 55.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 57.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue in both periods was primarily attributable to lower manufacturing and warranty costs. Gross margin was 75.0 and 70.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 73.4 and 70.7 in the nine months ended September 30 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses increased 0.8 million, or 3 , to 26.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase

This increase was primarily attributable to a 1.2 million increase in personnel-related compensation expenses and a 0.9 million increase in IT related expenses, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in occupancy costs, depreciation expense and professional fees. Reimbursement, general and administrative expenses increased 4.3 million, or 9 , to 51.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 46.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The primary driver of the change was the fact that we did not have a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets for the current year period, while in the prior year period there was a release of a valuation allowance to recognize the full value of our deferred tax assets. We recorded an income tax expense of 3.3 million and an income tax benefit of 16.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary driver of the change was the fact that we did not have a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets for the current year period, while in the prior year period there was a release of a valuation allowance to recognize the full value of our deferred tax assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows On September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of 82.1 million and net accounts receivable of 43.2 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of 66.0 million and net accounts receivable of 58.5 million at September 30, 2023. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:

Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 1.5 million, consisting of purchases of property and equipment, and patent costs. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1.2 million, primarily consisting of a 2.3 million payment made on our term loan, partially offset by 1.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ESPP.

Credit Agreement On April 30, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Restated Credit Agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. The Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated in its entirety our prior credit agreement. On September 8, 2021, we entered into a First Amendment Agreement (the Amendment ), which amended the Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendment, the Credit Agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Amendment, among other things, added a 30.0 million incremental term loan to the 25.0 million revolving credit facility provided by the Restated Credit Agreement. The term loan is reflected on our condensed consolidated financial statements as a note payable. The Credit Agreement provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may increase the amount of the revolving loans available under the Credit Agreement and/or add one or more term loan facilities in an amount not to exceed 25.0 million in the aggregate, such that the total aggregate principal amount of loans available under the Credit Agreement (including under the revolving credit facility) does not exceed 80.0 million. On September 8, 2021, in connection with the closing of the acquisition of the AffloVest business, we borrowed the 30.0 million term loan and utilized that borrowing, together with a draw of 25.0 million under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the purchase price.

 On February 22, 2022, we entered into a Second Amendment Agreement (the Second Amendment ), which further amends the Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment modified the maximum leverage ratio, the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum consolidated EBITDA covenants under the Credit Agreement, and added a minimum liquidity covenant, through the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The Second Amendment also increased the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans under the Credit Agreement during the period commencing on the date of the Second Amendment and ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, we made a mandatory principal prepayment of the term loan of 3.0 million on February 22, 2022. On June 21, 2023, we entered into a Third Amendment Agreement (the Third Amendment that replaced the interest rate benchmark under the Credit Agreement from LIBOR to the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). All tenors of term SOFR are subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 Adjusted Term SOFR ). On August 1, 2023, we entered into a Fourth Amendment Agreement (the Fourth Amendment ), which further amended the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment, among other things, decreased the commitment fees payable under the revolving credit facility and eliminated the temporary increase in the applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR loans. The Fourth Amendment also eliminated the liquidity financial covenant and modified the remaining financial covenants to reflect the termination of the temporary covenant relief period that was in place until June 30, 2023 pursuant to the Second Amendment. In addition, the Fourth Amendment provided for an additional term loan in the amount of 8.25 million, which we used for a paydown of the revolving credit facility. The Fourth Amendment also extended the maturity date of the term loans and revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement from September 8, 2024 to August 1, 2026. On November 1, 2024, we entered into a Fifth Amendment Agreement (the Fifth Amendment ), which further amended the Credit Agreement. The Fifth Amendment permits the Company to make payments to repurchase shares of its common stock, as long as the Company is not in default before and after giving effect to such repurchases, and as long as such repurchases do not exceed 30.0 million. On December 21, 2023, we made a payment of 16.8 million to repay in full the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 27.0 million under the Credit Agreement, comprised entirely of the term loan. The principal of the term loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments of 750,000. For additional information regarding the Credit Agreement, including interest rates, fees and maturities, see Note 8 Credit Agreement of the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report. Share Repurchase Program On October 30, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 30.0 million of common stock. Under the program, purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated purchases, or both. The timing and number of shares to be purchased will be based on the price of our common stock, general business and market conditions and other investment considerations and factors. The share repurchase program expires on October 31, 2026. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We intend to finance the share repurchase program with cash on hand. Future Cash Requirements For a discussion of our material estimated future cash requirements under our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, in total and disaggregated into current and long-term , see Future Cash Requirements included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Adequacy of Resources Our future cash requirements may vary significantly from those now planned and will depend on many factors, including: the impacts of inflation, rising interest rates or a recession on our business; sales and marketing resources needed to further penetrate our market; expansion of our operations; response of competitors to our solutions and applications; costs associated with clinical research activities; increases in interest rates; labor shortages and wage inflation; component price inflation; costs to develop and implement new products; and use of capital for acquisitions or licenses, if any. 
 Historically, we have experienced increases in our expenditures consistent with the growth in our revenue, operations and personnel, and we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase as we expand our business. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt repayment and related interest, and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Inflation and changing prices did not have a material effect on our business during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business for at least the next twelve months. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our business.

The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE PLAN 

Adopted: 01-Nov-2018 Amended and Restated: 15-Oct-2024 
 I. INTRODUCTION Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. (the Company has established the Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. Executive Employee Severance Plan (the Plan to provide severance pay and other benefits to eligible executive-level employees of the Company whose employment terminates under certain covered circumstances. The Company, in its complete and sole discretion, will determine who is an eligible employee under the Plan, the requirements to receive severance benefits under the Plan, and the amount of any severance benefits under the Plan. This Plan supersedes and replaces any policy, plan or practice that may have existed in the past regarding the payment of severance benefits to eligible employees. This document is both the Plan document and the Summary Plan Description for the Plan. II. ELIGIBILITY All employees designated by the Company s Board of Directors Board or a committee thereof as eligible to be a participant in the Plan are eligible to become participants in the Plan. An eligible employee becomes a participant Participant as of the later of (i) the effective date of this Plan or (2) the date he or she is first classified by the Board or a committee thereof as an eligible employee. In order for an eligible employee to become a Participant under this Plan the eligible employee must sign a Confidentiality, Assignment of Intellectual Property and Restrictive Covenants Agreement (or similarly titled agreement) in a form approved by the Board or a committee thereof, unless such requirement is waived in writing by the Board or a committee thereof. You will cease to be a Participant in this Plan when you cease to be designated by the Board or a committee thereof as eligible to be a participant in the Plan. III. SEVERANCE EVENTS In general, if you are an eligible Participant in this Plan, and you comply with all provisions and requirements of the Plan, then you will receive severance benefits if your employment with the Company is terminated (either before a Change in Control or within 12 months following a Change in Control) (i) at the initiative of the Company other than for Cause or (ii) by you for Good Reason. These concepts are described in detail below. For Cause . You will not be eligible for benefits under this Plan if your employment is terminated by the Company for Cause. Cause means: (i) an act or acts of dishonesty undertaken by you and intended to result in personal gain or enrichment of you or others at the expense of the Company; (ii) unlawful conduct or gross misconduct by you that, in either event, is materially injurious to the Company; (iii) you being convicted of a felony; or (iv) any material breach by you of any terms or conditions of any written agreement between you and the Company which breach has not been cured by you within 15 days after written notice thereof to you from the Company. 
 For the purposes of clauses (ii) and (iv) above, no act or failure to act on your part shall be considered Cause if done by you pursuant to specific authorization evidenced by a resolution duly adopted by the 
 1 

Board or pursuant to specific advice given by counsel for the Company, unless such specific authorization or advice results in whole or in part from material misrepresentations or omissions by you. Good Reason . If you initiate the termination of your employment with the Company, you will be eligible for Plan benefits only if you terminated with Good Reason, as defined below. Good Reason means the occurrence of any of the following events without your consent: (i) the assignment of you to a position with responsibilities or duties of a materially lesser status or degree than your position as of the date this Plan was adopted; (ii) any material breach of any terms or conditions of any written agreement between the Company and you by the Company not caused by you; or (iii) the requirement by the Company that you relocate out of the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropolitan area or metropolitan area designated by the Company at the later of your initial employment date or the date this Plan is adopted by the Company. Good Reason shall not exist unless you have first provided written notice to the Company of the occurrence of one or more of the conditions under clauses (i) through (iii) above within 90 days of the condition s initial occurrence, such condition is not fully remedied by the Company within 30 days after the Company s receipt of written notice from you, and your termination of employment with the Company occurs no later than 130 days after the condition s initial occurrence. Change in Control . For purposes of this Plan, a qualifying Change in Control means a Change in Control as defined in the Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. Disability . For purposes of this Plan, Disability means your inability to perform on a full-time basis the duties and responsibilities of your employment with the Company by reason of your illness or other physical or mental impairment or condition, if such inability continues for an uninterrupted period of 90 days or more during any 180-day period. A period of inability is uninterrupted unless and until you return to full-time work for a continuous period of at least 30 days. Termination Date . For purposes of this Plan, Termination Date means the date on which a separation from service has occurred for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the regulations and guidance thereunder (the Code ). Timely Release Required. Regardless of the reason for your termination, you will not be eligible for Plan benefits unless you sign an approved release form after your employment with the Company actually terminates, timely deliver such signed release form to the Company and do not rescind the release during any period during which rescission is permissible. You may obtain a copy of the current release form at any time by contacting the Company s Human Resources Department. However, the Company will determine the contents of the release form, and may revise it from time to time as appropriate to deal with particular severance situations. As such, the release form you will be required to sign to receive benefits under the Plan may differ from any release form you previously received. The release will generally include provisions addressing a full release of all claims you may have against the Company and related individuals and entities (to the full extent permitted under applicable law) and provisions concerning your ongoing compliance with your non-disclosure of confidential information, assignment of intellectual property, non-competition and non-solicitation obligations to the Company, including those obligations that survive the termination of your employment with the Company. Severance benefits will be paid only after any period for rescinding the release has expired. If you violate any provisions of the release, the Company will no longer be required to pay you any remaining severance benefits due to you under the Plan. Ineligibility for Benefits. Severance benefits will not be paid under this Plan in any of the following circumstances: 
 2 

You are offered another position with the Company (or the successor/ purchasing entity) and you refuse to accept that position, other than for Good Reason. You voluntarily terminate your employment with the Company (or the successor/purchasing entity), other than for Good Reason. Your termination of employment occurs more than 12 months after a Change in Control occurs. Your termination of employment does not qualify as a separation from service under Section 409A of the Code. Your employment is terminated by the Company (or the successor/ purchasing entity) for Cause. Your employment terminates due to death, Disability, or failure to return to work for the Company following a leave of absence, layoff or any other period of authorized absence from the Company. You have not signed a Confidentiality, Assignment of Intellectual Property and Restrictive Covenants Agreement. You refuse to sign the release form prepared by the Company, or you rescind the release before it becomes final. You breach any provisions included in the release form prepared by the Company. 
 IV. PLAN BENEFITS A Participant who experiences a qualifying severance event under Section III while a Participant will be eligible to receive severance benefits under the Plan, including severance pay and vesting of equity awards as set forth below. Severance Pay (CEO) If you are a Participant, you are the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and you experience a qualifying severance event and you otherwise qualify for benefits under the Plan, then you will be entitled to the severance pay and benefits described below. Qualifying Severance Event Before a Change in Control: The Company will pay you an amount equal to two times your annualized base salary as of your Termination Date, payable in substantially equal installments in accordance with the Company s regular payroll schedule commencing with the first normal payroll date of the Company following the Termination Date and continuing for 24 months thereafter, provided that any installments that would have been paid during the 60 day period immediately following the Termination Date shall be held by the Company until the first payroll date occurring more than 60 days after the Termination Date. If you are eligible for and take all steps necessary to continue your group health insurance coverage with the Company following the Termination Date, the Company will pay for the portion of the premium costs for such coverage that the Company would pay if you had remained employed by the Company, at the same level of coverage that was in effect as of the Termination Date, for a period of 18 consecutive months after the Termination Date (or until you receive group health or dental coverage from another employer, if earlier). Qualifying Severance Event Within 12 Months After a Change in Control: The Company will pay you an amount equal to two times the sum of (i) your annualized base salary as of your Termination Date, plus (ii) your target incentive bonus as of your Termination Date, less applicable 
 3 

withholdings, payable in a lump sum on the Company s first payroll date occurring more than 60 days after the Termination Date (but no later than 75 days after the Termination Date). If you are eligible for and take all steps necessary to continue your group health insurance coverage with the Company following the Termination Date, the Company will pay for the portion of the premium costs for such coverage that the Company would pay if you had remained employed by the Company, at the same level of coverage that was in effect as of the Termination Date, for a period of 18 consecutive months after the Termination Date (or until you receive group health or dental coverage from another employer, if earlier). Severance Pay (Non-CEO) If you are a Participant, you are employed in any position other than Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and you experience a qualifying severance event and you otherwise qualify for benefits under the Plan, then you will be entitled to the severance pay and benefits described below. Qualifying Severance Event Before a Change in Control: The Company will pay you an amount equal to one times your annualized base salary as of your Termination Date, payable in substantially equal installments in accordance with the Company s regular payroll schedule commencing with the first normal payroll date of the Company following the Termination Date and continuing for 12 months thereafter, provided that any installments that would have been paid during the 60 day period immediately following the Termination Date shall be held by the Company until the first payroll date occurring more than 60 days after the Termination Date. If you are eligible for and take all steps necessary to continue your group health insurance coverage with the Company following the Termination Date, the Company will pay for the portion of the premium costs for such coverage that the Company would pay if you had remained employed by the Company, at the same level of coverage that was in effect as of the Termination Date, for a period of 12 consecutive months after the Termination Date (or until you receive group health or dental coverage from another employer, if earlier). Qualifying Severance Event Within 12 Months After a Change in Control: The Company will pay you an amount equal to one times the sum of (i) your annualized base salary as of your Termination Date, plus (ii) your target incentive bonus as of your Termination Date, less applicable withholdings, payable in a lump sum on the Company s first payroll date occurring more than 60 days after the Termination Date (but no later than 75 days after the Termination Date). If you are eligible for and take all steps necessary to continue your group health insurance coverage with the Company following the Termination Date, the Company will pay for the portion of the premium costs for such coverage that the Company would pay if you had remained employed by the Company, at the same level of coverage that was in effect as of the Termination Date, for a period of 12 consecutive months after the Termination Date (or until you receive group health or dental coverage from another employer, if earlier). Equity Vesting If you experience a qualifying severance event and you otherwise qualify for benefits under the Plan, and the Termination Date occurs before a Change in Control, then with respect to any equity-based award that has been granted to you under the Company s applicable equity incentive plan and is outstanding and not fully vested on such Termination Date (an Equity Award ), a number of shares, as determined below, of such Equity Award will vest as of the date your release becomes irrevocable. Time-Based Vesting: The number of shares or stock units which will become vested for an Equity Award that is solely subject to time-based vesting shall be (1) the number of shares or stock units subject to the Equity Award multiplied by a fraction (x) whose numerator is the number of days 
 4 

elapsed during the applicable vesting period prior to your Termination Date and (y) whose denominator is the total number of days in the vesting period, minus (2) the number of shares or stock units as to which the Equity Award had vested prior to your Termination Date. Performance-Based Vesting: First, each Equity Award that is subject to the satisfaction of performance goals over a performance period Performance Awards which has more than one sub-performance periods or performance years will be divided into separate tranches of awards for each applicable period or year, with such accelerated vesting determined separately for each tranche. If the Performance Award has only one performance period or performance year, the entire award will be considered one tranche. Then, the number of shares or stock units subject to a tranche of a Performance Award that will become vested will be determined as follows: o The number of shares that will vest for a tranche of a Performance Award with a completed performance period or performance year that is subject to additional time-based vesting, including, for avoidance of doubt, the time between the end of a performance period and the date of certification of performance, shall be (1) the number of earned number of shares or stock units subject to the tranche based on actual performance achieved, multiplied by (2) a fraction (x) whose numerator is the number of days between the first day of the applicable performance period or performance year and your Termination Date and (y) whose denominator is the total number of days between the first day of the applicable performance period or performance year and the date of the tranche s certification of performance. o The number of shares that will vest for a tranche of a Performance Award if the Termination Date occurs between the first and last day of the performance period or performance year shall be (1) the number of shares or stock units subject to that tranche that would otherwise be earned and vest at the end of the applicable performance period or performance year if target level performance had been achieved, multiplied by (2) a fraction (x) whose numerator is the number of days between the first day of the applicable performance period or performance year and your Termination Date and (y) whose denominator is the total number of days between the first day of the applicable performance period or performance year and the scheduled vesting date. o If a performance period or performance year for a tranche of a Performance Award has not yet commenced as of your Termination Date, you will not vest in that tranche and the shares or stock units will be automatically forfeited. 
 If you experience a qualifying severance event and you otherwise qualify for benefits under the Plan, and the Termination Date occurs within 12 months after a Change in Control, then the unvested portion of any Equity Award which is not a Performance Award that is outstanding on such Termination Date will vest in full as of the date your release becomes irrevocable. If the Equity Award is a Performance Award, the number of shares that will vest will be (1) the number of shares or stock units that would otherwise vest at the end of the applicable performance period if target level performance had been achieved, minus (2) the number of shares or stock units as to which the Equity Award had vested prior to your Termination Date. If an Equity Award is a stock option or stock appreciation rights award, it will remain exercisable to the extent so vested for one year after your Termination Date, but no later than the expiration date of the award. This extension of the post-termination exercise period will cause any of your stock options which are incentive stock options pursuant to Section 422 of the Code ISOs to no longer be treated as ISOs and to convert to nonqualified stock options. Any Equity Award not vested after application of the equity vesting provisions of this Plan will be cancelled and permanently forfeited.

Section 409A This Plan is intended to provide for payments and benefits that are exempt from, or that comply with, the requirements of Section 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Code, including current and future guidance and regulations interpreting such provisions, and should be interpreted accordingly. Each payment or benefit made pursuant to this Plan shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. In addition, payments or benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), as involuntary separation pay pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), and/or under any other exemption that may be applicable, and this Plan shall be construed accordingly. To the extent that any amounts payable under this Plan are required to be delayed under Code Section 409A, such amounts are intended to be and should be considered for purposes of Code Section 409A as separate payments from the amounts that are not required to be delayed. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Participant is considered a specified employee (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i)) as of the Termination Date, then no payments of deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A and payable due to such Participant s separation from service shall be made under this Plan before the first business day that is six months after the Termination Date (or upon the Participant s death, if earlier) (the Specified Period ). Any deferred compensation payments that would otherwise be required to be made to a Participant during the Specified Period will be accumulated by the Company and paid to the Participant on the first day after the end of the Specified Period. The foregoing restriction on the payment of amounts to a Participant during the Specified Period will not apply to the payment of employment taxes. Section 280G If any payment or benefit to be paid or provided to a Participant under this Plan, taken together with any payments or benefits otherwise paid or provided to such Participant by the Company or any corporation that is a member of an affiliated group (as defined in Section 1504 of the Code without regard to Section 1504(b) of the Code) of which the Company is a member (the other arrangements ), would collectively constitute a parachute payment (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), and if the net after-tax amount of such parachute payment to such Participant is less than what the net after-tax amount to such Participant would be if the aggregate payments and benefits otherwise constituting the parachute payment were limited to three times such Participant s base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) less 1.00, then the aggregate payments and benefits otherwise constituting the parachute payment shall be reduced to an amount that shall equal three times such Participant s base amount, less 1.00. Should such a reduction in payments and benefits be required, such Participant shall be entitled, subject to the following sentence, to designate those payments and benefits under this Plan or the other arrangements that will be reduced or eliminated so as to achieve the specified reduction in aggregate payments and benefits to such Participant and avoid characterization of such aggregate payments and benefits as a parachute payment. The Company will provide such Participant with all information reasonably requested by such Participant to permit the Participant to make such designation. To the extent that such Participant s ability to make such a designation would cause any of the payments and benefits to become subject to any additional tax under Code Section 409A, or if such Participant fails to make such a designation within ten business days of receiving the requested information from the Company, then the Company shall achieve the necessary reduction in such payments and benefits by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the payments and benefits that are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating the non-cash portion of the payments and benefits, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments and benefits which are to be paid or provided the furthest in time from the date of the Company s determination. A net after-tax amount shall be determined by taking into account all applicable income, excise and employment taxes, whether imposed at the federal, state or local level, including the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. 
 6 

Reductions of Severance Benefits Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, all severance benefits payable under this Plan will be reduced, as and when it is otherwise payable, by the amount of any severance or similar payment required to be paid to you by the Company under applicable federal, state, and local laws. Cash severance payments are also subject to all applicable withholding due on any severance benefits, including state and federal income tax withholding and FICA and Medicare tax withholding. Coordination/Offsets for Employment Agreements If you are party to an individual written employment contract or agreement with the Company (or a subsidiary) that provides for the payment of any benefits upon termination of your employment, then your cash severance benefits under this Plan will be reduced as follows. Any cash severance pay under this Plan will be reduced (offset), as and when it is otherwise payable, by the amount of any cash payment made or due to be made by the Company to you pursuant to an employment contract, agreement or other severance arrangement, to the extent such payment is called a severance payment or otherwise becomes payable due to a termination of your employment with the Company (but not including any cash severance payments that are specifically due to COBRA premiums or outplacement) . If such an agreement, contract or arrangement provides for cash severance payments in excess of those provided under this Plan, no severance pay will be due under this Plan. However, you may still be eligible for other benefits under the Plan, to the extent benefits are not duplicative of what you are receiving under the agreement, contract or arrangement. Termination of Severance Benefits All severance benefits payable under this Plan will be terminated if the Company determines that you have violated your ongoing obligations with respect to non-disclosure of confidential information, assignment of intellectual property, non-competition and non-solicitation, including those obligations under your Confidentiality, Assignment of Intellectual Property and Restrictive Covenants Agreement and any other agreement with the Company that survive the termination of your employment with the Company. Specifically with respect to Equity Awards, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement evidencing an Equity Award, if you violate any of your ongoing obligations described above, then (i) you will immediately forfeit all outstanding Equity Awards and any right to receive shares thereunder, and (ii) with respect to shares that have been issued pursuant to an Equity Award within two (2) years prior to such violation, you shall either (A) return such shares to the Company or (B) pay to the Company in cash an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares as of the date their receipt became taxable to you. V. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN Except as provided below, the Company reserves the right in its discretion to amend or terminate this Plan, or to alter, reduce, or eliminate any severance benefit, practice or policy hereunder, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason without the consent of or notice to any employee or any other person having any beneficial interest in this Plan. Such action may be taken by the Board of the Company, the Compensation Committee of the Board, or by any other individual or committee to whom such authority has been delegated by the Board. However, during the 12-month period following a Change in Control, the Plan may not be amended, terminated or otherwise altered to reduce the amount (or negatively change the terms) of any severance benefit that becomes payable to a Participant who was a Participant in the Plan on the day prior to the Change in Control. In addition, if a Change in Control occurs within the 6-month period following the effective date of an amendment to terminate the Plan or otherwise reduce the amount (or negatively alter the terms) of any severance benefit under the Plan, such amendment (or portion of such amendment) will become null and void upon the Change in Control. Upon the Change in Control, the Plan will automatically revert to the terms in effect prior to the adoption of said amendment. 
 7 

Notwithstanding the above limitations, the Plan may be amended at any time (and such amendment will be given affect) if such amendment is required to bring the Plan into compliance with applicable law, including but not limited to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (and the regulations or other applicable guidance thereunder). VI. SUBMITTING CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS Normally, the Company will determine an employee s eligibility and benefit amount on its own and without any action on the part of the terminating employee, other than returning the release form. The severance payments will begin as soon as administratively feasible after the date the release becomes irrevocable. Formal Claims for Benefits. If you think you are entitled to benefits but have not been so notified by the Company, if you disagree with a decision made by the Company, or if you have any other complaint regarding the Plan that is not resolved to your satisfaction, you or your authorized representative may submit a written claim for benefits. The claim must be submitted to the Company s Human Resources Department within six months after the date you terminated employment. Claims received after that time will not be considered. The Company will ordinarily respond to the claim within 90 days of the date on which it is received. However, if special circumstances require an extension of the period of time for processing a claim, the 90-day period can be extended for an additional 90 days by giving you written notice of the extension, the reason why the extension is necessary, and the date a decision is expected. The Company will give you a written notice of its decision if it denies your claim for benefits in whole or in part. The notice will explain the specific reasons for the decision, including references to the relevant plan provision upon which the decision is based, with a description of any additional material or information necessary for you to perfect your claim, and the procedures for appealing the decision. Appeals. If you disagree with the initial claim determination, in whole or in part, you or your authorized representative can request that the decision be reviewed by filing a written request for review with the Company s Human Resources Department within 60 days after receiving notice that the claim has been denied. You or your representative may present written statements describing reasons why you believe the claim denial was in error, and should include copies of any documents you want us to consider in support of your appeal. Your claim will be decided based on the information submitted, so you should make sure that your submission is complete. Upon request to the Company, you may review all documents we considered or relied on in deciding your claim. (You may also receive copies of these documents free of charge.) Any appeal will be reviewed and decided by person(s) other than the person(s) who made the determination on your original claim. Generally, the decision will be reviewed within 60 days after the Company receives a request for review. However, if special circumstances require a delay, the review may take up to 120 days. (If a decision cannot be made within the 60-day period, you will be notified of this fact in writing.) You will receive a written notice of the decision on the appeal, which will explain the reasons for the decision by making specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the decision is based. Limitations Period . The claims procedure above is mandatory. If an employee has completed the entire claims procedure and still disagrees with the outcome of the employee s claim, the employee may commence a civil action under 502(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ). The employee must commence such civil action within one year of the date of the final denial, or the employee will waive all rights to relief under ERISA.
