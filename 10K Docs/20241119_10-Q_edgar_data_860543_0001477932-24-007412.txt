Standard warranties are offered at no cost to customers to cover parts for three years, and labor and maintenance are offered for one year for product defects. Cost of Revenue Cost of goods sold represents costs directly related to supplies and materials, machines, freight and delivery, commissions, printing, packaging and other costs. We expect our cost of goods sold per unit to decrease as we continue to scale our operations, improve product designs and work with our third-party suppliers to lower costs. 21 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with our business development efforts with our distributors and partners and costs related to trade shows and other marketing programs. We expense sales and marketing costs as incurred. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as we expand our sales and marketing teams and increase our participation in global trade shows and other marketing programs. General and Administrative . Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits, travel and other costs for employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party consulting, legal, audit, accounting services, and allocations of overhead costs, such as rent, facilities and information technology. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as our revenue increases.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1,737. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have financed our operations principally through receipts of customer payments and proceeds on the convertible note payable of 100,000. We anticipate that we will need additional financing to continue as an ongoing entity over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors. There can be no assurance we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, our financial results and business prospects may be materially adversely affected. 23 Table of Contents Operating Activities We have historically experienced negative cash outflows. Our net cash used in operating activities primarily results from our operating losses combined with changes in working capital components as we have grown our business and is influenced by the timing of cash payments for inventory purchases and cash receipts from our customers. Our primary source of cash flow from operating activities is cash down payments and final payments for our machines. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are employee-related expenditures and amounts due to vendors for purchased components. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by our working capital requirements and the extent to which we build up our inventory balances and increase spending on personnel and other operating activities as our business grows. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 224,901, compared to 316,637 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investing Activities The Company had no investing activities in either period. Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 100,000 in proceeds from the new convertible note payable, and made payments of 18,883 on notes payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received 50,000 in proceeds from the new line of credit, and made payments of 69,737 on notes payable and 1,000 of debt issuance cost. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable SEC regulations. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts. Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents. We consider investments that, when purchased, have a remaining maturity of ninety (90) days or less to be cash equivalents. We do not believe that a notional or hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would have a material impact on our interest income. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management concluded there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. This conclusion is due to identified control deficiencies around the identification of errors during year end resulting in material adjusting journal entries as well as a lack of a formal policy for the approval, identification and authorization of related party transactions. 24 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company has a pending lawsuit with one of its previous suppliers regarding defected cartridges. The Company is still evaluating the case and determining the impact of the case on the Company and as of the date of this Report the amount or range of possible losses is not reasonably estimable. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time and harm our business. Item 1A.
