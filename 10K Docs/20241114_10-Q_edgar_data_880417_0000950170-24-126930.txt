 securities in an unrealized loss position on September 30, 2024 , of which were in a continuous loss position for twelve (12) months or more. Each quarter the Company conducts a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on the securities portfolio. Management believes the Company will fully recover the cost of these securities. Unrealized losses on the Company s fixed-rate debt securities are a result of interest rate increases. U.S. Treasury securities and investments in securities of U.S. government sponsored agency bonds comprise million of total AFS securities. The remaining million of non-agency debt securities is made up of Corporate Bonds and debt securities to State and Political Subdivisions. For non-agency debt securities, the Company verified the current credit ratings remain above investment grade. Non-rated debt securities total million. Annually, management reviews the credit profile of each non-rated issue and assesses whether any impairment to the contractually obligated cash flow is likely to occur. Based on these reviews, management has concluded the underlying creditworthiness for each security remains sufficient to maintain required payment obligations and, therefore, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded. Management believes the value will recover as the securities approach maturity or market interest rates change. The Bank monitors the credit quality of held-to-maturity debt securities primarily through utilizing their credit rating. The Bank monitors the credit rating on a quarterly basis. There are no nonperforming held-to-maturity securities. As of September 30, 2024 , ACL was required for any held-to-maturity security. The majority of the securities are explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the United States government, and any estimate of expected credit losses would be insignificant to the Bank.

Net Loans 

Loan Origination/Risk Management The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. The Company s management examines current and occasionally projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers; however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers.

 million; warehouse million: healthcare million; residential investment property million; retail strip center million; auto repair million; retail store million; senior housing million; hotels million; office building million. With respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by non-owner-occupied properties, the Company generally requires the borrower to have had an existing relationship with the Company and have a proven record of success. Construction and land development loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction and land development loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction and land development loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing. The Company originates consumer loans utilizing a judgmental underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, mitigates risk. The Company maintains an independent credit department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company s policies and procedures. Loans serviced for others approximated million and million on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 largest industries compared to total loans on September 30, 2024 , included million, or , of total loans to lessors of non-residential buildings, million, or , of total loans to manufacturers of animal food, and million, or , of total loans to hotels. These loans are generally secured by real property and equipment, with repayment expected from operational cash flow. Credit evaluation is based on a review of cash flow coverage of principal, interest payments, and the adequacy of the collateral received. million and the commercial real estate charge-off for this same relationship was thousand. The charge-offs also increased the historical loss rates which are applied to the active balances multiplied by the weighted average life of the loan pools. The remaining provision amounts for the quarter are primarily a result of changes in loan volume and weighted average remaining maturities of the loans in each category. For the three months ended September 2023, the decrease in the provision for commercial and industrial loans primarily relates to the recovery of prior loan charge-offs, as well as the decrease in substandard loan balances in this loan category. The remaining provision changes for the quarter are primarily a result of changes in loan volume in each loan category. For the nine month period in 2023, the decrease in provision for commercial real estate loans is due to the payoff of one larger loan relationship with a specific allocation. The increase in the provision for commercial lessors of buildings relates to the increase in loans graded special mention in this category. All other changes during the nine month period are related to loan volume changes.

 thousand. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Pass . Loans classified as pass (Cash Secured, Exceptional, Acceptable, Monitor, or Pass Watch) may exhibit a wide array of characteristics but at a minimum represent an acceptable risk to the Bank. Borrowers in this rating may have leveraged but acceptable balance sheet positions, satisfactory asset quality, stable to favorable sales and earnings trends, acceptable liquidity and adequate cash flow. Loans are considered fully collectible and require an average amount of administration. While generally adhering to credit policy, these loans may exhibit occasional exceptions that do not result in undue risk to the Bank. Borrowers are generally capable of absorbing setbacks, financial and otherwise, without the threat of failure. Special Mention . Assets assigned a Special Mention grade are not considered classified assets but are considered criticized. These assets exhibit potential weaknesses that, deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank s credit position at some future date. Loans in this rating warrant special attention but have not yet reached the point of concern for loss. These assets have deteriorated sufficiently to the point they would have difficulty refinancing elsewhere. Similarly, purchasers of the business would not be eligible for bank financing unless they represent a significantly stronger credit risk. Substandard . Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful . Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

 Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty Occasionally, the Bank modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Bank may provide multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. There were no modifications of loans to borrowers in financial distress completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

NOTE 6 FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) The fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information. Since no ready market exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are largely based on judgments after considering such factors as future expected credit losses, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.

CSB BANCORP, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following management s discussion and analysis focuses on the consolidated financial condition of the Company on September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, and the consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Total assets increased 30 million to 1.21 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.18 billion at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, securities decreased 23 million, net loans increased 18 million, and cash and cash equivalents increased 32 million. Deposits and short-term borrowings increased 26 million. 
 Net loans increased 18 million, or 3 , as commercial and commercial real estate loans increased 1 million, or less than 1 , compared to December 31, 2023 and residential real estate loans increased 8 million, or 5 , from December 31, 2023. Construction loans increased 8 million, or 16 , from December 31, 2023. Consumer refinance activity slowed from previous periods on mortgage loans, while home purchase activity remained stable despite limited inventory, and home equity line balances increased by 2 million. Residential mortgage loan originations, including home equity lines, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 39 million, a slight increase from 38 million in mortgage originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Mortgage loan originations sold into the secondary market were 7 million and 3 million, respectively during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The Bank originates and sells primarily fixed rate thirty-year mortgages into the secondary market. 
 The allowance for credit losses for loans increased 617 thousand from December 31, 2023 to 7.2 million. A previously identified commercial lending relationship totaling 6.4 million experienced credit deterioration and was placed on nonaccrual during the second quarter 2024 while the company was being offered for sale. On July 23, 2024 the bank was notified that the borrower's company would cease operations. The credit was charged down in third quarter 2024 by 4.1 million as the liquidation of assets is in process. 
 28 

CSB BANCORP, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Net charge-offs were 4.3 million, or an annualized 0.81 of average loans, in the current nine-month period compared to net recoveries of 125 thousand, or (0.03 of average loans in the year-ago nine-month period. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1 . We believe the allowance level is appropriate given the level of problem loans and composition of the overall loan portfolio in the current economic environment. 
 Nonperforming loans increased 3 million to 3.4 million, or 0.47 , of total loans from 396 thousand, or 0.06 of total loans, on December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 7 million in loans were placed on nonaccrual status, 253 thousand in paydowns were received, and 4.1 million in loans were charged-off due to non-payment.

The ratio of gross loans to deposits was 67 at September 30, 2024, compared to 68 at December 31, 2023. 
 The Company has no exposure to government-sponsored enterprise preferred stocks, collateralized debt obligations, or trust preferred securities. Management has considered industry analyst reports, sector credit reports, and the volatility within the bond market in concluding that the gross unrealized losses of 34 million within the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of September 30, 2024, was primarily the result of current market yields compared to the yields at the time the investments were purchased by the Company and not due to credit quality. As a result, all embedded security losses on September 30, 2024, are considered temporary and no allowance for credit loss is necessary. 
 The weighted average life of total debt securities was 5.23 years at September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.09 years at December 31, 2023. If interest rates declined 100 basis points, the weighted average life was estimated to fall to 4.98 years at September 30, 2024 and 4.98 years at December 31, 2023. If interest rates rose 100 basis points the weighted average life would be expected to increase to 5.42 years at September 30, 2024 and 5.16 years at December 31, 2023. 
 Deposits increased 43 million, or 4 , from December 31, 2023 with noninterest-bearing deposits decreasing approximately 15 million, or 5 , and interest-bearing deposit accounts increasing approximately 58 million, or 8 . Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 are 1.07 billion, or 5 , above September 30, 2023 deposit balances. On a year over year comparison, decreases were recognized in noninterest-bearing demand deposits of 13 million, interest bearing demand accounts of 19 million, and savings accounts of 7 million. Increases were recognized in money market accounts of 29 million, and time deposits of 63 million. Deposits have increased as customers move excess liquid funds into money market accounts and time certificates of deposit to take advantage of the increased interest rates. The estimated amount of uninsured deposits was 275 million, 254 million, and 267 million as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Short-term borrowings consisting of overnight repurchase agreements with retail customers decreased 17 million, or 46 , to 19 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 as customers moved money into higher interest rate money market and time deposit accounts. Other borrowings decreased 458 thousand as the Company repaid FHLB advances. 
 Total shareholders equity amounted to 115 million, or 9.5 , of total assets at September 30, 2024, an increase of 7 million, or 7 , from 108 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to net income of 7.7 million, other comprehensive income of 3 million, less cash dividends of 3 million, and treasury stock repurchase of 397 thousand. Total accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL") decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to decreases in interest rates and improvements in pricing in government agency and corporate bonds as AFS securities are marked to fair market value. This remaining unrealized

 loss in securities is temporary and is adjusted monthly for additional interest rate fluctuations, principal paydowns, calls, and maturities. The Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2024 as shown in the Capital Resources section of this report. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded net income of 3.1 million and 3.5 million and 1.18 and 1.30 per share, respectively. The 300 thousand decrease in net income for the period was primarily the result of the provision for credit losses and off-balance sheet commitments of 700 thousand compared to the provision for credit losses in the prior year period of 177 thousand. The increase of 377 thousand in net interest income and 104 thousand increase in noninteret income was offset by a 388 thousand increase in noninterest expenses. The federal income tax provision decreased 94 thousand. Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"), (a non-GAAP measure), totaled 4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 93 thousand, or 2 , from the prior year's third quarter. 
 
 Return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.05 and 11.14 , respectively, for the three-month period of 2024, compared to 1.19 and 13.63 , respectively for the same quarter in 2023.

 1 Average balances have been computed on an average daily basis. 
 2 Average rates have been computed based on the amortized cost of the corresponding asset or liability. 
 3 Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. 
 4 Taxable equivalent adjustments have been computed assuming a 21 tax rate in 2024 and 2023 (non-GAAP). 
 Interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 13.2 million representing a 1.5 million, or 13 increase, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to increased interest rates and increased volumes on loans and interest-earning deposits in other banks. These increases were partially offset by the volume decreases in taxable securities to the comparable period. Average interest-earning deposit rates decreased 4 basis points while loan rates rose 41 basis points, and taxable securities' interest rates rose 7 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 4 million, an increase of 1.1 million, or 38 , from the same quarter in 2023. The increase in interest expense occurred primarily due to the increase in interest rates and volume increases of money market and time deposit accounts for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the bank recognized net charge-offs of 4 million, compared to 119 thousand net recoveries for the same quarter in 2023. The provision for credit losses on loans in the current quarter of 645 thousand, compared to a provision of 13 thousand in the same quarter ended 2023. The company recorded a 55 thousand provision for credit loss on off-balance commitments in the third quarter 2024 compared to a 164 thousand provision in the third quarter of 2023. The quarter increase results primarily from a single commercial credit facility that ceased operations on July 23, 2024. The credit facility has been charged down by 4.1 million with the company's assets being liquidated through the court system which increased the historical loss component of the calculation. 
 Economic indicators reflect a leveling off in residential real estate prices and increases in unemployment rates. The provision for credit losses is determined based on management s calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, which includes provisions for classified loans as well as for the remainder of the portfolio based on historical data, including past charge-offs and current economic trends. 
 Noninterest income increased 104 thousand, or 6 , compared to third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a 59 thousand increase in gain on sale of mortgage loans to the secondary market, a 28 thousand increase in the unrealized gain on equity securities, a 24 thousand increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance, and a 15 thousand increase in trust and brokerage fees. Offsetting decreases were recognized in service charges related to deposit overdraft fees and credit card fees. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased 388 thousand, or 6 , from third quarter 2023. Salary and employee benefit costs increased 227 thousand, or 7 , compared to the prior year quarter with increases in base salary, insurance, and social security taxes. Marketing and public relation costs increased 38 thousand, or 31 , with increases in community related activities. Professional and directors fees increased 25 thousand, or 7 , state financial institutions tax increased 24 thousand, or 13 , due to the increase in capital. Debit card expenses increased 7 thousand, or 4 , primarily with increases in processing. Software expense increased 13 thousand, or 3 . Equipment expense increased 25 thousand, or 13 , with increasing costs of maintenance contracts and repairs. The Company s third quarter efficiency ratio increased to 58.2 compared to 57.0 in the prior year. 
 Federal income tax expense decreased 94 thousand, or 11 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the third quarter 2023. The provision for income taxes was 756 thousand (effective rate of 19.4 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 850 thousand (effective rate of 19.6 for the same quarter ended 2023.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded net income of 7.7 million and 11.1 million and 2.89 and 4.12 per share, respectively. The 3.4 million decrease in net income for the nine-month period was primarily the result of the provision for credit losses and off-balance sheet commitments of 4.7 million compared to the provision for credit losses in the prior year period of 286 thousand and an increase in noninterest expenses of 576 thousand. These decreases to net income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest income of 256 thousand and an increase in net interest income of 491 thousand. PPNR totaled 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 171 thousand, or 1 , from the prior year's nine months. 
 
 The federal income tax provision was 918 thousand lower during the nine-month period in 2024 than in 2023. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.88 and 9.30 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.28 and 14.85 , respectively for the same period in 2023.

CSB BANCORP, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 38 million representing a 5 million increase, or 14 , compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to volume and yield increases on loans along with rate increases on interest-earning deposits in other banks and taxable securities for the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 11 million, an increase of 4 million, or 62 , from the same period in 2023. The increase in interest expense occurred primarily due to an increase in rates on most interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as a shift in balances into higher rate time deposits. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses and off-balance sheet was 5 million, compared to 286 thousand for the same period in 2023. For more discussion see Results of Operations, three months. The provision for credit losses is determined based on management s calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, which includes provisions for classified loans as well as for the remainder of the portfolio based on historical data, including past charge-offs and current economic trends. 
 
 Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 5.3 million, an increase of 256 thousand, or 5 , compared to the same period in 2023. Fees from trust and brokerage services increased 182 thousand for the period due to a one time fee collected in the first quarter. The gain on the sale of mortgage loans to the secondary market increased 109 thousand to 215 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as improved pricing for smaller balance mortgage loans attracted buyers and some mortgage loan refinancing. Earnings on bank owned life insurance policies increased 65 thousand for the period. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased 52 thousand, or 6 , compared to the same period in 2023 primarily from decreases in overdraft fees. Credit card fee income decreased 51 thousand, or 10 . 
 
 Noninterest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 576 thousand, or 3 , compared to the same period in 2023. Professional and director fees increased 87 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.Debit card expense increased 74 thousand, or 15 , primarily due to processing increases. Financial institutions tax increased 72 thousand, or 13 , based on increased capital. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased 70 thousand over the same period in 2023 with an increase in maintenance expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased 69 thousand, or less than 1 . Marketing and public relations expense increased 49 thousand, or 13 , with increases in community related activities. Software increased 35 thousand, or 3 . 
 
 Federal income tax expense decreased 918 thousand, or 34 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The provision for income taxes was 1.8 million (effective rate of 18.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.7 million (effective rate of 19.7 for the same period ended 2023.

CSB BANCORP, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The Company maintained a strong capital position with tangible common equity to tangible assets of 9.2 at September 30, 2024 compared with 8.8 at December 31, 2023. 
 Consistent with the Board of Director s commitment to public confidence and safe and sound banking operations, capital targets and minimum risk-based capital ratios for CSB were established to maintain excess capital to well-capitalized standards. To be considered well-capitalized, an institution must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 , a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 , a leverage capital ratio of at least 5 , a common equity tier 1 CET1 ratio of at least 6.5 and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level. An adequately capitalized institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 , a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 , a CET1 ratio of at least 4.5 , and a leverage ratio of at least 4 . 
 Failure to meet specified minimum capital requirements could result in regulatory actions by the Federal Reserve or Ohio Division of Financial Institutions that could have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Management believes there were no material changes to capital resources as presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.

Liquidity refers to the Company s ability to generate sufficient cash to fund current loan demand, meet deposit withdrawals, pay operating expenses, and meet other obligations. Liquidity is monitored by the Company s Asset Liability Committee. Other sources of liquidity include, but are not limited to, purchases of federal funds, advances from the FHLB, adjustments of interest rates to attract deposits, brokered deposits, and borrowing at the Federal Reserve discount window. Additionally, the Company could sell all of its AFS securities and the loss would not cause a change in the capital adequacy classification. Management believes its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as such term is defined in applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission rules) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 PER SHARE DATA 
 Earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year. The company currently maintains a simple capital structure, thus, there are no dilutive effects on earnings per share. 
 The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for earnings per share computations was as follows:

 ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Ohio's unemployment rate rose to 4.5 in September 2024 which was up from 3.7 in December 2023. Holmes County, where the bank is headquartered, is reporting an unemployment rate of 3.2 in September 2024. Of the counties within the bank's footprint, Stark County reported the highest unemployment rate at 4.4 , while Tuscarawas and Wayne Counties posted unemployment rates of 4.0 and 3.5 respectively in September 2024. The rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, decreased to 2.4 on a year over year basis at September 2024, following average inflation rates of 4.1 in 2023 and 8.0 in 2022. The rate continues to be above the Federal Reserve target rate of 2 . The Federal Reserve began to reduce the federal funds target rate by 0.50 in September 2024, and again by 0.25 in November 2024, to a range of 4.50 to 4.75 . 
 Management performs a quarterly analysis of the Company s interest rate risk over a twenty-four-month horizon. The analysis includes two balance sheet models, one based on a static balance sheet and one on a dynamic balance sheet with projected growth in assets and liabilities. All balance sheet positions, and interest rate projections are currently within the Company s board-approved policy for both the twelve- month and twenty-four-month periods. 
 The following table presents an analysis of the estimated sensitivity of the Company s annual net interest income to sudden and sustained -400 through +400 basis point changes, in 100 basis point increments, in market interest rates at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The net interest income reflected is for the first twelve-month period of the modeled twenty-four-month horizon. The underlying balance sheet for illustrative purposes is dynamic with projected growth in assets and liabilities.
