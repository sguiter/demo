 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 
 
 The Company supplies technology and expertise for the management of fluids and coatings in both industrial and commercial applications. It designs, manufactures and markets systems and equipment to move, measure, control, dispense and spray fluid and coating materials. Management classifies the Company s business into three reportable segments: Contractor, Industrial and Process. Key strategies include developing and marketing new products, leveraging products and technologies into additional, growing end-user markets, expanding distribution globally and completing strategic acquisitions that provide additional channels and technologies. 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis reviews significant factors affecting the Company s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 

Consolidated Results 
 
 A summary of financial results follows (in millions except per share amounts): 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Sep 27, 2024 Sep 29, 2023 Change Sep 27, 2024 Sep 29, 2023 Change Net Sales

 0.71 0.76 (7) 2.13 2.24 (5) 
 (1) See below for a reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. 
 
 Net sales for the third quarter decreased 4 percent from the comparable period last year. Regionally, net sales decreased in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Net sales in the Americas increased in the third quarter and were flat for the year to date. Changes in currency translation rates did not have a significant impact on worldwide net sales for the third quarter and decreased worldwide net sales by 4 million for the year to date. 
 Operating earnings for the third quarter decreased 11 percent from the comparable period last year due to lower sales volume and higher operating expenses. 
 Net earnings for the third quarter decreased 8 percent from the comparable period last year as increased interest income and lower interest expense partially offset the decrease in operating earnings. On an adjusted basis, net earnings decreased 7 percent.

 Excluding the impacts of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and impairment charges presents a more consistent basis for comparison of financial results. A calculation of the non-GAAP adjusted measurements of operating earnings, earnings before income taxes, income taxes, effective income tax rates, net earnings and diluted earnings per share follows (in millions except per share amounts):

 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit margin rate improved approximately 1 percentage point for both the third quarter and year to date from the comparable periods last year due to favorable price-cost dynamics.

Table of Contents 

 Operating Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses increased 9 million (7 percent) for the third quarter and 19 million (5 percent) for the year to date, respectively, compared to last year. More than half of the increase for the quarter and year to date was from investments in new product development and other growth initiatives, including the relocation to a new distribution center. Reductions in volume and earnings-based expenses of 3 million for the quarter and 8 million for the year to date partially offset the increase in operating expenses. 
 
 Interest and Other (Income) Expense 
 
 Interest expense was 1 million lower for the third quarter and 3 million lower for the year to date compared to the same periods last year as private placement debt was repaid in the third quarter of 2023. Other income increased 4 million for the quarter and 10 million for the year to date from the comparable periods last year largely due to increased interest income. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 19 percent for the third quarter and 17 percent for the year to date. Adjusted to exclude the impacts of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, the adjusted effective income tax rate of 19 percent for the quarter and 20 percent for the year to date was comparable to last year.

Table of Contents 

 Contractor segment net sales decreased 1 percent for both the third quarter and year to date as favorable response to new product offerings was unable to offset softness in worldwide construction markets. For the quarter, price realization was unable to offset higher expenses, which resulted in a 1 percentage point decrease in the operating margin rate. The operating margin rate for the year to date increased 1 percentage point as price realization and lower product costs combined to more than offset higher expenses.

 Industrial segment net sales decreased 1 percent for the third quarter as timing of finishing system sales in the Americas largely offset declines in Asia Pacific. For the year to date, net sales declined 4 percent as sales growth in the Americas was unable to offset decreases in both EMEA and Asia Pacific. The operating margin rate decreased 1 percentage point for the quarter and 2 percentage points for the year to date as price realization was unable to offset the unfavorable effects of lower volume, product and channel mix, and higher expenses.

 Three Months Nine Months Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Americas (6) 0 0 (6) (6) 0 0 (6) EMEA (14) 0 0 (14) (10) 0 0 (10) Asia Pacific (27) 0 0 (27) (23) 0 0 (23) Segment Total (12) 0 0 (12) (10) 0 0 (10) 
 Continued weakness in the Process segment's semiconductor product application drove a double-digit decrease in net sales for both the third quarter and year to date. Operating margin rates for the quarter and year to date declined, driven by lower sales volume and higher expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 436 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 491 million in the same period last year. Lower net earnings, increased inventory purchases, and the timing of estimated income tax payments in 2024 drove most of the decrease. Inventory levels increased in 2024 primarily due to the effect of new product offerings. Significant uses of cash in the first nine months of 2024 included plant and equipment additions of 93 million and dividend payments of 129 million. Net proceeds from shares issued totaled 45 million, which were partially offset by share repurchases of 31 million. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2023, significant uses of cash included plant and equipment additions of 146 million, dividend payments of 119 million, and long-term debt payments of 75 million. Net proceeds from shares issued totaled 54 million, which was partially offset by share repurchases of 27 million. 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, the Company had available liquidity of 1,539 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 764 million, of which 226 million was held outside of the U.S., and available credit under existing committed credit facilities of 775 million. 
 
 Cash balances and unused financing sources are expected to provide the Company with the flexibility to meet its liquidity needs for the next 12 months and beyond, including its capital expenditure plan, planned dividends, share repurchases, announced and potential future acquisitions, and operating requirements. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately 120 million, including 70 million in facility expansion projects. The Company may make opportunistic share repurchases going forward. 

Outlook 
 
 The Company's end markets and regions continue to face demand challenges. The Company reaffirms its full-year 2024 revenue guidance of a low single-digit decline on an organic, constant currency basis.

Graco Reports Third Quarter Results 
 
 MINNEAPOLIS October 23, 2024 Graco Inc. (NYSE GGG) today announced results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2024. 
 
 Summary 
 in millions except per share amounts 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Sep 27, 2024 Sep 29, 2023 Change Sep 27, 2024 Sep 29, 2023 Change Net Sales 519.2 539.7 (4) 1,564.6 1,629.0 (4) Operating Earnings 145.7 163.2 (11) 440.1 476.9 (8) Net Earnings 122.2 133.1 (8) 377.4 396.6 (5) Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share 0.71 0.77 (8) 2.19 2.30 (5) Adjusted (non-GAAP) (1) 
 Operating Earnings, adjusted 145.7 162.4 (10) 440.1 476.1 (8) Net Earnings, adjusted 122.2 131.5 (7) 367.1 386.9 (5) Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share, adjusted 0.71 0.76 (7) 2.13 2.24 (5) 
 (1) Excludes impacts of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and impairment charges. See Financial Results Adjusted for Comparability below for a reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. 
 Net sales for the third quarter decreased 4 percent, with decreases in all segments. Regionally, sales increased modestly in the Americas and decreased in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
 Lower sales volume and higher operating expenses contributed to an 11 percent decline in operating earnings for the third quarter. 
 Net earnings for the third quarter decreased 8 percent as increased interest income and lower interest expense partially offset the decrease in operating earnings. 
 We continued to experience soft demand trends in our core end markets, especially in Asia Pacific, which negatively affected our sales for the third quarter, said Mark Sheahan, Graco's President and CEO. The decline in demand was widespread, with the most significant impact felt in the Industrial and Process segments. However, our gross margin remained resilient despite the decrease in volume. 

Page 2 GRACO 

Consolidated Results 
 Net sales for the third quarter decreased 4 percent from the comparable period last year. Third quarter net sales increased 1 percent in the Americas, decreased 2 percent in EMEA (3 percent at consistent translation rates) and decreased 21 percent in Asia Pacific. Year-to-date net sales decreased 4 percent from the comparable period last year. Year-to-date net sales were flat in the Americas, decreased 2 percent in EMEA (3 percent at consistent translation rates) and decreased 18 percent in Asia Pacific (17 percent at consistent translation rates). Changes in currency translation rates did not have a significant impact on worldwide net sales for the third quarter and decreased worldwide net sales by 4 million for the year to date. 
 
 Gross profit margin rate improved approximately 1 percentage point for both the third quarter and year to date from the comparable periods last year due to favorable price-cost dynamics. 
 
 Total operating expenses increased 9 million (7 percent) for the third quarter and 19 million (5 percent) for the year to date, respectively, compared to last year. More than half of the increase for the quarter and year to date was from investments in new product development and other growth initiatives, including the relocation to a new distribution center. Reductions in volume and earnings-based expenses of 3 million for the quarter and 8 million for the year to date partially offset the increase in operating expenses. 
 
 Interest expense was 1 million lower for the third quarter and 3 million lower for the year to date compared to the same periods last year as private placement debt was repaid in the third quarter of 2023. Other income increased 4 million for the quarter and 10 million for the year to date from the comparable periods last year largely due to increased interest income. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 19 percent for the third quarter and 17 percent for the year to date. Adjusted to exclude the impacts of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises (see Financial Results Adjusted for Comparability below), the adjusted effective income tax rate of 19 percent for the quarter and 20 percent for the year to date was comparable to last year. 

Segment Results 
 Management assesses performance of segments by reference to operating earnings excluding unallocated corporate expenses. For a reconciliation of segment operating earnings to consolidated operating earnings, refer to the segment information table included in the financial statement section of this release. Certain measurements of segment operations are summarized below 
 Three Months Nine Months Contractor Industrial Process Contractor Industrial Process Net Sales (in millions) 242.3 156.3 120.6 742.0 454.0 368.7 Percentage change from last year Sales (1) (1) (12) (1) (4) (10) Operating earnings (3) (4) (25) 3 (8) (18) Operating earnings as a percentage of sales 2024 29 34 27 30 33 28 2023 30 35 31 29 35 31

Components of net sales change by geographic region for the Contractor segment were as follows

 Contractor segment net sales decreased 1 percent for both the third quarter and year to date as favorable response to new product offerings was unable to offset softness in worldwide construction markets. For the quarter, price realization was unable to offset higher expenses, which resulted in a 1 percentage point decrease in the operating margin rate. The operating margin rate for the year to date increased 1 percentage point as price realization and lower product costs combined to more than offset higher expenses. 
 Components of net sales change by geographic region for the Industrial segment were as follows

 Industrial segment net sales decreased 1 percent for the third quarter as timing of finishing system sales in the Americas largely offset declines in Asia Pacific. For the year to date, sales growth in the Americas was unable to offset decreases in both EMEA and Asia Pacific. The operating margin rate decreased 1 percentage point for the quarter and 2 percentage points for the year to date as price realization was unable to offset the unfavorable effects of lower volume, product and channel mix, and higher expenses. 
 Components of net sales change by geographic region for the Process segment were as follows 
 Three Months Nine Months Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Americas (6) 0 0 (6) (6) 0 0 (6) EMEA (14) 0 0 (14) (10) 0 0 (10) Asia Pacific (27) 0 0 (27) (23) 0 0 (23) Consolidated (12) 0 0 (12) (10) 0 0 (10) 
 Continued weakness in the Process segment's semiconductor product application drove a double-digit decrease in net sales for both the third quarter and year to date. Operating margin rates for the quarter and year to date declined, driven by lower sales volume and higher expenses. 

Outlook 
 Overall, many of our end markets and regions continue to face challenges, said Sheahan. We are reaffirming our full-year revenue guidance, which anticipates a low single-digit decline on an organic, constant currency basis. Despite this outlook, we remain dedicated to our established core strategies creating innovative products, expanding our distribution, exploring new and adjacent markets, and pursuing strategic acquisitions. We are eager to continue advancing these strategies within the framework of the new organizational structure.

2025 Change in Organizational Structure 
 
 As previously announced, effective January 1, 2025, the Company will move to a global, customer-centric operating structure with four business divisions Industrial, Powder, Expansion Markets and Contractor. 
 
 Industrial Division 
 The Company s current Industrial and Lubrication Equipment Divisions, along with the Process Transfer Equipment business that is part of the Company s Process Division, will be combined to form the new global Industrial Division. 
 
 Powder Division 
 The Powder Division is currently structured as a global business and will continue to operate as it does today. 
 
 Expansion Markets Division 
 The Expansion Markets Division will focus on driving the Company's inorganic growth in new and adjacent markets. The Company s existing environmental, semiconductor, high-pressure valves and electric motors businesses, together with select future ventures and acquisitions, will reside within this newly-formed division. 
 
 Contractor Division 
 The Company's current Contractor Equipment Division, renamed the Contractor Division, will be restructured to serve the needs of its global customers. 
 
 Reportable Segments 
 Starting January 1, 2025, the Company will classify its business into three reportable segments Industrial, Expansion Markets and Contractor. 
 
 The Industrial segment, consisting of the newly formed Industrial Division and the Powder Division. 
 The Expansion Markets segment consisting of the Expansion Markets Division. 
 The Contractor segment, consisting of the Contractor Division, will remain unchanged as a reporting segment relative to prior periods. 
 
 Segment operating results will be reported under the new organizational structure for the first quarter of 2025, in connection with the effective date of the realignment. Historic segment information will be recasted to conform to the new organizational structure. The Company expects to provide recast segment financial information in connection with its earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2024 as supplemental information on the Company s website at www.graco.com.

Financial Results Adjusted for Comparability 
 Excluding the impacts excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and impairment charges presents a more consistent basis for comparison of financial results.
