The Company originates, structures, and invests in secured term loans, bonds or notes and mezzanine debt primarily in privately-held middle market companies but may also invest in other investments such as loans to publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds, and distressed debt securities (collectively the Debt Securities Portfolio ). The Company also invests in debt and subordinated securities issued by collateralized loan obligation funds CLO Fund Securities ). In addition, from time to time the Company may invest in the equity securities of privately held middle market companies and may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with its debt investments. The Company has elected to be treated and intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. As a RIC, the Company generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that it distributes in a timely manner to its stockholders. On March 29, 2018, the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ), including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act SBCA ). As a result, the Company s asset coverage requirement for senior securities changed from to , effective as of March 29, 2019. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company formed a joint venture with Freedom 3 Opportunities LLC Freedom 3 Opportunities ), an affiliate of Freedom 3 Capital LLC, to create KCAP Freedom 3 LLC (the F3C Joint Venture ). The F3C Joint Venture may originate loans from time to time and sell them to the fund capitalized by the F3C Joint Venture. On , the Company entered into an agreement with LibreMax Intermediate Holdings, LP LibreMax under which Commodore Holdings, LLC Commodore ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, sold the Company s wholly-owned asset manager subsidiaries Katonah Debt Advisors, LLC Katonah Debt Advisors ), Trimaran Advisors, L.L.C. Trimaran Advisors ), and Trimaran Advisors Management, L.L.C. Trimaran Advisors Management and, together with Katonah Debt Advisors and Trimaran Advisors, the Disposed Manager Affiliates ), for a cash purchase price of approximately million (the LibreMax Transaction ). The LibreMax Transaction closed on . As of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining wholly-owned asset management subsidiaries (the Asset Manager Affiliates were comprised of Commodore, Katonah Management Holdings, LLC, Katonah X Management LLC, Katonah 2007-1 Management, LLC and KCAP Management, LLC. Prior to their sale in the LibreMax Transaction, the Disposed Manager Affiliates represented substantially all of the Company s investment in the Asset Manager Affiliates. The Externalization Agreement On December 14, 2018, the Company entered into a stock purchase and transaction agreement (the Externalization Agreement with BC Partners Advisors L.P. BCP ), an affiliate of BC Partners LLP, BC Partners ), through which Sierra Crest Investment Management LLC (the Adviser ), an affiliate of BC Partners, became the Company s investment adviser pursuant to an investment advisory Agreement (the Advisory Agreement with the Company. At a special meeting of the Company s stockholders (the Special Meeting held on February 19, 2019, the Company s stockholders approved the Advisory Agreement. The transactions contemplated by the Externalization Agreement closed on April 1, 2019 (the Closing ), and the Company commenced operations as an externally managed BDC managed by the Adviser on that date. On the date of the Closing, the Company changed its name from KCAP Financial, Inc. to Portman Ridge Finance Corporation and on April 2, 2019, began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol PTMN. About the Adviser The Adviser is an affiliate of BC Partners. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, the Adviser is responsible for managing the Company s business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring the Company s investments, and monitoring the Company s portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. The Adviser seeks to invest on behalf of the Company in performing, well-established middle market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries (i.e., no concentration in any one industry). The Adviser employs fundamental credit analysis, targeting investments in businesses with relatively low levels of cyclicality and operating risk. The holding size of each position will generally be dependent upon a number of factors including total facility size, pricing and structure, and the number of other lenders in the facility. The Adviser has experience managing levered vehicles, both public and private, and seeks to enhance the Company s returns through the use of leverage with a prudent approach that prioritizes capital preservation. The Adviser believes this strategy and approach offers attractive risk/return with lower volatility given the potential for fewer defaults and greater resilience through market cycles. During the fourth quarter of 2020, LibreMax Intermediate Holdings, LP LibreMax sold its minority stake in the Adviser to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mount Logan Capital Inc. Mount Logan ). An affiliate of BC Partners serves as administrator to Mount Logan.

Under the terms of the merger agreement for the GARS Acquisition, dated (the GARS Merger Agreement ), each share of common stock, par value per share, of GARS (the GARS Common Stock issued and outstanding was converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to approximately and (ii) approximately shares of common stock, par value per share, of the Company (plus any applicable cash in lieu of fractional shares).

 million in cash paid by the Company, (ii) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, and (iii) an additional cash payment from the Adviser of million in the aggregate. Shares of common stock issued and market price have not been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. With respect to the merger consideration from the Company, HCAP stockholders as of immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger (other than Cancelled Shares) were entitled, with respect to all or any portion of the shares of HCAP common stock they held as of the effective time of the first merger, to elect to receive the merger consideration in the form of cash (an Election or in the form of the Company's common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations in the merger agreement. Any HCAP stockholder who did not validly make an Election was deemed to have elected to receive shares of the Company s common stock with respect to the merger consideration as payment for their shares of HCAP common stock. Each share of HCAP common stock (other than Cancelled Shares) with respect to which an Election was made was treated as an Electing Share and each share of HCAP Common Stock (other than a Cancelled Share) with respect to which an Election was not made or that was transferred after the election deadline on June 2, 2021 was treated as a Non-Electing Share. Pursuant to the conditions of and adjustment mechanisms in the HCAP Merger Agreement, Electing Shares were converted to Non-Electing Shares for purposes of calculating the total mix of consideration to be paid to each Electing Share in order to ensure that the value of the aggregate cash consideration paid to holders of the Electing Shares equaled the aggregate cash consideration that HCAP received from the Company under the terms of the HCAP Merger Agreement. Accordingly, as a result of the Elections received from HCAP stockholders and any resulting adjustment under the terms of the HCAP Merger Agreement, each Electing Share received, in aggregate, approximately in cash and shares of the Company's common stock, while each Non-Electing Share received, in aggregate, approximately shares of the Company's common stock.

No change of control offer was required to be made in respect of the HCAP Notes in connection with the consummation of the HCAP Acquisition. The HCAP Notes could be redeemed by the Company at any time at par value plus accrued and unpaid interest. On July 23, 2021, the Company redeemed the entire notional amount of million of the HCAP Notes.

The Reverse Stock Split became effective as of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern Time) on August 26, 2021. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, any stockholder who would have been entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split received cash payments in lieu of such fractional shares (without interest and subject to backup withholding and applicable withholding taxes). On August 23, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to decrease the number of authorized shares of common stock by one half of the reverse stock split ratio (the Decrease Shares Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company made approximately million of investments and had approximately million in repayments and sales, resulting in net repayment and sales of approximately million for the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made approximately million of investments and had approximately million in repayments and sales, resulting in net repayment and sales of approximately million for the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company made approximately million of investments and had approximately million in repayments and sales, resulting in net repayments and sales of approximately million for the period. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of investments in portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately million . As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio consisted of investments in portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately million. 
 
 of the investment portfolio at the end of each quarter. The Company follows the provisions of ASC 820: Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820: Fair Value ). This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. ASC 820: Fair Value defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Adviser utilizes one or more independent valuation firms to provide third party valuation consulting services. Each quarter the independent valuation firms perform third party valuations of the Company s investments in material illiquid securities such that they are reviewed at least once during a trailing 12-month period. These third-party valuation estimates are considered as one of the relevant data points in the Adviser s determination of fair value. The Adviser may consider other methods of valuation than those set forth below to determine the fair value of Level III investments as appropriate in conformity with GAAP. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments. Further, such investments may be generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may occur over the life of the investments that may cause the value realized on such investments to be different from the currently assigned valuations. The majority of the Company s investment portfolio is composed of debt and equity securities with unique contract terms and conditions and/or complexity that requires a valuation of each individual investment that considers multiple levels of market and asset specific inputs, which may include historical and forecasted financial and operational performance of the individual investment, projected cash flows, market multiples, comparable market transactions, the priority of the security compared with those of other securities for such issuers, credit risk, interest rates, and independent valuations and reviews. Debt Securities . To the extent that the Company s investments are liquid and are priced or have sufficient price indications from normal course trading at or around the valuation date (financial reporting date), such pricing will be used to determine the fair value of the investments. Valuations from third party pricing services may be used as an indication of fair value, depending on the volume and reliability of the valuation, sufficient and reasonable correlation of bid and ask quotes, and, most importantly, the level of actual trading activity. However, if the Company has been unable to identify directly comparable market indices or other market guidance that correlate directly to the types of

of our debt investments were on non-accrual status with an aggregate amortized cost of million and an aggregate fair value of million , which represented and of the investment portfolio, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, of our debt investments were on non-accrual status with an aggregate amortized cost of million and an aggregate fair value of million, which represented and of the investment portfolio, respectively . Investment Income on CLO Fund Securities . The Company generates investment income from its investments in the most junior class of securities issued by CLO Funds (typically preferred shares or subordinated securities). The Company s CLO Fund junior class securities are subordinated to senior note holders who typically receive a stated interest rate of return based on a floating rate index, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR on their investment. The CLO Funds are leveraged funds and any excess cash flow or excess spread (interest earned by the underlying securities in the fund less payments made to senior note holders and less fund expenses and management fees) is paid to the holders of the CLO Fund s subordinated securities or preferred shares. GAAP-basis investment income on CLO equity investments is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC 325-40, based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated projected future cash flows due to changes in prepayments and/or re-investments, credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield prospectively over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from both the tax basis investment income and from the cash distributions actually received by the Company during the period. For non-junior class CLO Fund Securities, interest is earned at a fixed spread relative to the SOFR index. Investment Income on Joint Ventures . The Company recognizes investment income on its investment in the Joint Ventures based upon its share of the estimated earnings and profits of the Joint Venture on the ex-dividend or ex-distribution date. The final determination of the tax attributes of distributions from the Joint Ventures is made on an annual (full calendar year) basis at the end of the year based upon taxable income and distributions for the full year. Therefore, any estimate of tax attributes of distributions made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for the full year. Fees and other income . Origination fees (to the extent services are performed to earn such income upon closing), amendment fees, consent fees, and other fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when they are earned. Prepayment penalties received by the Company for debt instruments repaid prior to maturity date are recorded as income upon receipt.

The Company has determined that the F3C Joint Venture is an investment company under Accounting Standards Codification ASC ), Financial Services Investment Companies ASC 946 ), however, in accordance with such guidance, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. The Company does not consolidate its interest in the F3C Joint Venture because the Company does not control the F3C Joint Venture due to allocation of the voting rights among the F3C Joint Venture partners. The fair value of the Company s investment in the F3C Joint Venture as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. Series A Great Lakes Funding II LLC In August 2022, the Company invested in Series A Great Lakes Funding II LLC (the Great Lakes II Joint Venture, collectively with the F3C Joint Venture the Joint Ventures ), a joint venture with an investment strategy to underwrite and hold senior, secured unitranche loans made to middle-market companies. The Company treats its investment in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture as a joint venture since an affiliate of the Adviser controls a voting interest in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture. In connection with the launch of the Great Lakes II Joint Venture, the Company entered into a series of transactions pursuant to which the Company s prior investment in BCP Great Lakes Holdings LP, a vehicle formed as a co-investment vehicle to facilitate the participation of certain co-investors to invest, directly or indirectly, in BCP Great Lakes Funding, LLC (the Prior Great Lakes Joint Venture ), and the corresponding assets held by the Prior Great Lakes Joint Venture in respect of the Company s investment in BCP Great Lakes Holdings LP, were transferred to the Great Lakes II Joint Venture in complete redemption of the Company s investment in BCP Great Lakes Holdings LP.
 The Great Lakes II Joint Venture is a Delaware series limited liability company, and pursuant to the terms of the Great Lakes Funding II LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement (the Great Lakes II LLC Agreement ), prior to the end of the investment period with respect to each series established under the Great Lakes II LLC Agreement, each member of the predecessor series would be offered the opportunity to roll its interests into any subsequent series of the Great Lakes II Joint Venture. The Company does not pay any advisory fees in connection with its investment in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture. Certain other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates have also invested in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture.
 The fair value of the Company s investment in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. Fair value has been determined utilizing the practical expedient pursuant to ASC 820-10. Pursuant to the terms of the Great Lakes II LLC Agreement, the Company generally may not effect any direct or indirect sale, transfer, assignment, hypothecation, pledge or other disposition of or encumbrance upon its interests in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture, except that the Company may sell or otherwise transfer its interests with the consent of the managing members of the Great Lakes II Joint Venture or to an affiliate or a successor to substantially all of the assets of the Company.
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an unfunded commitment of million and million to the Great Lakes II Joint Venture, respectively. Fair Value Measurements The Company follows the provisions of ASC 820: Fair Value, which among other matters, requires enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. This standard defines fair value and establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. ASC 820: Fair Value defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This fair value definition focuses on an exit price in the principle, or most advantageous market, and prioritizes, within a measurement of fair value, the use of market-based inputs (which may be weighted or adjusted for relevance, reliability and specific attributes relative to the subject investment) over entity-specific inputs. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. ASC 820: Fair Value establishes the following three-level hierarchy, based upon the transparency of inputs to the fair value measurement of an asset or liability as of the measurement date: Level I Unadjusted quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The type of investments included in Level I include listed equities and listed securities. As required by ASC 820: Fair Value, the Company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price. Level II Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Such inputs may be quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for

As a BDC, the Company is required to invest primarily in the debt and equity of non-public companies for which there is little, if any, market-observable information. As a result, a significant portion of the Company s investments at any given time will likely be deemed Level III investments. Investment values derived by a third-party pricing service are generally deemed to be Level III values. For those that have observable trades, the Company considers them to be Level II. The fair value of the Company s investment in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. Fair value has been determined utilizing the practical expedient pursuant to ASC 820-10. Subject to the limitations noted above, values derived for debt and equity securities using comparable public/private companies generally utilize market-observable data from such comparables and specific, non-public and non-observable financial measures (such as earnings or cash flows) for the private, underlying company/issuer. Such non-observable company/issuer data is typically provided on a monthly or quarterly basis, is certified as correct by the management of the company/issuer and/or audited by an independent accounting firm on an annual basis. Since such private company/issuer data is not publicly available it is not deemed market-observable data and, as a result, such investment values are grouped as Level III assets.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt securities may include, among other things, broad market indices, the comparable yields of similar investments in similar industries, effective discount rates, average EBITDA multiples, and weighted average cost of capital. Significant increases or decreases in such comparable yields would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s equity securities include the EBITDA multiple of similar investments in similar industries and the weighted average cost of capital. Significant increases or decreases in such inputs would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s CLO Fund Securities include default rates, recovery rates, prepayment rates, spreads, and the discount rate by which to value the resulting underlying cash flows. Such assumptions can vary significantly, depending on market data sources which often vary in depth and level of analysis, understanding of the CLO market, detailed or broad characterization of the CLO market and the application of such data to an appropriate framework for analysis. The application of data points are based on the specific attributes of each individual CLO Fund Security s underlying assets, historic, current and prospective performance, vintage, and other quantitative and qualitative factors that would be evaluated by market participants. The Company evaluates the source of market data for reliability as an indicative market input, consistency amongst other inputs and results and also the context in which such data is presented. Significant increases or decreases in probability of default and loss severity inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively.

 Compensation of Adviser Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Company pays the Adviser (i) a base management fee (the Base Management Fee and (ii) an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee ). The Income-Based Fee is of pre-incentive fee net investment income with a hurdle rate. The Capital Gains Fee is . Pre-incentive fee net investment income means dividends (including reinvested dividends), interest and fee income accrued by the Company during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company may not have received in cash. The Adviser is not obligated to return the incentive fee it receives on PIK interest that is later determined to be uncollectible in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. To determine the income incentive fee, pre-incentive fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a calendar quarter in which the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly hurdle rate, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that calendar quarter due to realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. In addition, because the quarterly hurdle rate is calculated based on our net assets, decreases in the Company s net assets due to realized capital losses or unrealized capital depreciation in any given calendar quarter may increase the likelihood that the hurdle rate is reached and therefore the likelihood of the Company paying an incentive fee for the subsequent quarter. The Company s net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of the Company s gross assets used to calculate the management fee because gross assets are total assets (including cash received) before deducting liabilities (such as declared dividend payments). The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears, equals of cumulative realized capital gains through the end of such calendar year commencing with the calendar year ending December 31, 2019, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, in each case calculated from the Effective Date, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for prior periods. The Company will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act including Section 205 thereof. The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. Limitations of Liability and Indemnification Under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including without limitation its managing member, will not be liable to the Company for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, except those resulting from acts constituting criminal conduct, gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of the duties that the Adviser owes to the Company under the Advisory Agreement. In addition, as part of the Advisory Agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Adviser and each of its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including without limitation its general partner, and the Administrator from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of the Company or its security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Adviser s duties or obligations under the Advisory Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser of the Company, except where attributable to criminal conduct, gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of such person s duties under the Advisory Agreement. Board Approval of the Advisory Agreement On December 12, 2018, the then-current Board of the Company held an in-person meeting to consider and approve the Advisory Agreement and related matters, and on April 1, 2019 the Company entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. The Board most recently determined to re-approve the Advisory Agreement at a meeting held on March 11, 2024. In reaching a decision to re-approve the Advisory Agreement, the Board was provided the information required to consider the Advisory Agreement, including: (a) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to the Company by the Adviser; (b) comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives; (c) the Company projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives; (d) any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the Adviser from its relationship with the Company and the profitability of that relationship; (e) information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Advisory Agreement; and (f) the organizational capability and financial condition of the Adviser and its affiliates. The Board, including a majority of independent directors will oversee and monitor the Company s investment performance and annually reviews the compensation we pay to the Adviser.

excise tax on such income, to the extent required. The Company may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or shares of its common stock at the election of each stockholder. Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the election of stockholders are treated as taxable dividends. The Internal Revenue Service has published guidance with respect to publicly offered RICs indicating that this rule will apply even where the total amount of cash that may be distributed is limited to no more than of the total distribution. Under this guidance, if too many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). If the Company decides to make any distributions consistent with this guidance that are payable in part in its stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, shares of the Company s stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of the Company s current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the Company s stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, the Company may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of the Company s stockholders determine to sell shares of its stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of the Company s stock.)

Dividends from Asset Manager Affiliates are recorded based upon a quarterly estimate of tax-basis earnings and profits of each Asset Manager Affiliate. Distributions in excess of the estimated tax-basis quarterly earnings and profits of each distributing Asset Manager Affiliate are recognized as tax-basis return of capital. The actual tax-basis earnings and profits and resulting dividend and/or return of capital for the year will be determined at the end of the tax year for each distributing Asset Manager Affiliate. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Asset Manager Affiliates did not make any cash distributions to the Company. Distributions to shareholders that exceed tax-basis distributable income (tax-basis net investment income and realized gains, if any) are reported as distributions of paid-in capital (i.e. return of capital). The tax character of distributions is made on an annual (full calendar-year) basis. The determination of the tax attributes of our distributions is made at the end of the year based upon our taxable income for the full year and the distributions paid during the full year. Therefore, a determination of tax attributes made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for a full year. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a net capital loss carryforward of million to offset net capital gains. This net capital loss carryforward is not subject to expiration. A portion of the Company s capital loss carryovers are subject to an annual use limitation under the Code and related regulations. The Company has certain taxable subsidiaries which have elected to be taxed as corporations for U.S. tax purposes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the taxable subsidiaries activity resulted in a benefit for income taxes of million . As of September 30, 2024, the taxable subsidiaries have, in aggregate, million of net deferred tax liabilities. A portion of the taxable subsidiaries net operating loss and capital loss carryovers are subject to an annual use limitation under the Code and related regulations. ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. The Company recognizes the tax benefits of

With respect to the merger consideration from the Company, HCAP stockholders as of immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger (other than Cancelled Shares) were entitled, with respect to all or any portion of the shares of HCAP common stock they held as of the effective time of the first merger, to elect to receive the merger consideration in the form of cash (an Election or in the form of the Company's common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations in the merger agreement.

PORTMAN RIDGE FINANCE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (Unaudited)

Item 2. 	 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q of this Quarterly Report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements due to factors discussed under the Risk Factors section included in our SEC filings and Note About Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 GENERAL 
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act ). Sierra Crest Investment Management LLC (the Adviser is an affiliate of BC Partners LLP BC Partners ). Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, the Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 We originate, structure, and invest in secured term loans, bonds or notes and mezzanine debt primarily in privately-held middle market companies but may also invest in other investments such as loans to publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds, and distressed debt securities (collectively the Debt Securities Portfolio ). We also invest in debt and subordinated securities issued by collateralized loan obligation funds CLO Fund Securities ). In addition, from time to time we may invest in the equity securities of privately held middle market companies and may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments. 
 In our Debt Securities Portfolio, our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from the investments in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments in privately-held middle market companies. We define the middle market as comprising companies with EBITDA of 10 million to 50 million and/or total debt of 25 million to 150 million. We primarily invest in first and second lien term loans which, because of their priority in a company s capital structure, we expect will have lower default rates and higher rates of recovery of principal if there is a default and which we expect will create a stable stream of interest income. While there is no specific collateral associated with senior unsecured debt, such positions are senior in payment priority over subordinated debt investments. The investments in our Debt Securities Portfolio are all or predominantly below investment grade, and have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 From time-to-time we have also made investments in CLO Fund Securities managed by other asset managers. Our collateralized loan obligation funds CLO Funds typically invest in broadly syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments. 
 Our portfolio may include covenant-lite loans which generally refer to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants. 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code and intend to operate in a manner to maintain our RIC status. As a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our net ordinary taxable income and the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, if any, for each year. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we timely distribute to our stockholders. 
 From time to time, we may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange debt securities in open market purchases or by other means dependent on market conditions, liquidity, contractual obligations, and other matters. In addition, we evaluate strategic opportunities available to us, including mergers with unaffiliated funds and affiliated funds, divestures, spin-offs, joint ventures and other similar transactions from time to time. An example of an opportunity we are currently in the initial stages of evaluating is a potential merger with one or more of our affiliated 1940 Act funds, which may result in the use of an exchange ratio other than NAV-for-NAV (including but not limited to relative market price) in connection therewith. 
 The Externalization 
 On April 1, 2019 (the Closing ), we became externally managed (the Externalization by the Adviser, pursuant to a stock purchase and transaction agreement (the Externalization Agreement with BC Partners Advisors L.P. BCP ), an affiliate of BC Partners. In connection with the Externalization, our stockholders approved an investment advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. See -Advisory Agreement below. 
 Pursuant to the Externalization Agreement with BCP, the Adviser became our investment adviser in exchange for a cash payment from BCP, or its affiliate, of 25 million, or 0.669672 per share of our common stock, directly to our stockholders. In addition, the Adviser (or its affiliate) will use up to 10 million of the incentive fee actually paid to the Adviser prior to the second anniversary of the Closing to buy newly issued shares of our common stock at the most recently determined net asset value per share of our common stock at the time of such purchase. In November 2020, the Adviser purchased approximately 570 thousand newly issued shares of our common stock in connection therewith, and in May 2021, the Adviser purchased approximately 4.0 million of newly issued shares of our common stock in connection therewith. In both cases, the shares were issued at the most recently determined net asset value per share of our common stock. The obligations of the Advisor to use incentive fees to purchase shares expired on April 1, 2021. For the period of one year from the first day of the first quarter following the quarter in which the Closing occurred, the Adviser will permanently forego up to the full amount of the incentive fees earned by the Adviser without recourse against or reimbursement by us, to the extent necessary in order to achieve aggregate net investment income per share of common stock for such one-year period to be at least equal to 0.40 per share, subject to certain adjustments. BCP and the Adviser s total financial commitment to the transactions contemplated by the Externalization Agreement was 35.0 million. 
 GARS Transaction 
 On October 28, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Garrison Capital Inc., a publicly traded BDC GARS , and such transaction, the GARS Acquisition ). To effect the acquisition, our wholly owned merger subsidiary merged with and into GARS, with GARS surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary. Immediately thereafter and as a single integrated transaction, GARS consummated a second merger, whereby GARS merged with and into us, with the Company surviving the merger. 
 In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement for the GARS Acquisition, dated June 24, 2020 (the GARS Merger Agreement ), each share of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, of GARS (the GARS Common Stock issued and outstanding was converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to approximately 1.19 and (ii) approximately 1.917 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of the Company (plus any applicable cash in lieu of fractional shares). Each share of GARS Common Stock issued and outstanding received, as additional consideration funded by the Adviser, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to 
 44 

approximately 0.31. In connection with the closing of the GARS Acquisition, the Board approved an increase in the size of the Board from seven members to nine members, and appointed each of Matthew Westwood and Joseph Morea to serve on the Board. 
 HCAP Acquisition and Assumption and Redemption of HCAP Notes 
 On June 9, 2021 we completed our acquisition of Harvest Capital Credit Corporation, a publicly traded BDC HCAP , and such transaction, the HCAP Acquisition ). To effect the acquisition, our wholly owned merger subsidiary Acquisition Sub merged with and into HCAP, with HCAP surviving the merger as the Company s wholly owned subsidiary. Immediately thereafter and as a single integrated transaction, HCAP consummated a second merger, whereby HCAP merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger. As a result of, and as of the effective time of, the second merger, HCAP s separate corporate existence ceased. 
 Under the terms of the merger agreement for the HCAP Acquisition, dated December 23, 2020 (the HCAP Merger Agreement ), HCAP stockholders as of immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger (other than shares held by a subsidiary of HCAP or held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or Acquisition Sub, and all treasury shares (collectively, Cancelled Shares )) received a combination of (i) 18.54 million in cash paid by the Company, (ii) 15,252,453 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and (iii) an additional cash payment from the Adviser of 2.15 million in the aggregate. 
 With respect to the merger consideration from the Company, HCAP stockholders as of immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger (other than Cancelled Shares) were entitled, with respect to all or any portion of the shares of HCAP common stock they held as of the effective time of the first merger, to elect to receive the merger consideration in the form of cash (an Election or in the form of our common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations in the merger agreement. Any HCAP stockholder who did not validly make an Election was deemed to have elected to receive shares of the Company s common stock with respect to the merger consideration as payment for their shares of HCAP common stock. Each share of HCAP common stock (other than Cancelled Shares) with respect to which an Election was made was treated as an Electing Share and each share of HCAP Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares) with respect to which an Election was not made or that was transferred after the election deadline on June 2, 2021 was treated as a Non-Electing Share. 
 Pursuant to the conditions of and adjustment mechanisms in the HCAP Merger Agreement, 475,806 Electing Shares were converted to Non-Electing Shares for purposes of calculating the total mix of consideration to be paid to each Electing Share in order to ensure that the value of the aggregate cash consideration paid to holders of the Electing Shares equaled the aggregate cash consideration that HCAP received from the Company under the terms of the HCAP Merger Agreement. Accordingly, as a result of the Elections received from HCAP stockholders and any resulting adjustment under the terms of the HCAP Merger Agreement, each Electing Share received, in aggregate, approximately 7.43 in cash and 0.74 shares of the Company's common stock, while each Non-Electing Share received, in aggregate, approximately 3.86 shares of the Company's common stock. 
 On June 9, 2021, the Company entered into a third supplemental indenture (the HCAP Third Supplemental Indenture by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ), effective as of the closing of the HCAP Acquisition. The HCAP Third Supplemental Indenture relates to the Company s assumption of 28.75 million in aggregate principal amount of HCAP s 6.125 Notes due September 15, 2022 (the HCAP Notes ). 
 Pursuant to the HCAP Third Supplemental Indenture, the Company expressly assumed the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on the HCAP Notes and the performance of HCAP s covenants under the base indenture, dated as of January 27, 2015, by and between HCAP and the Trustee, as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, dated as of August 24, 2017, by and between HCAP and the Trustee. No change of control offer was required to be made in respect of the HCAP Notes in connection with the consummation of the HCAP Acquisition. 
 The HCAP Notes could be redeemed by the Company at any time at par value plus accrued and unpaid interest. On July 23, 2021, the Company redeemed the entire notional amount of 28.75 million of the HCAP Notes.

The level of investment activity for investments funded and principal repayments for our investments can vary substantially from period to period depending on the number and size of investments that we invest in or divest of, and many other factors, including the amount and competition for the debt and equity securities available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies and the general economic environment.

Debt Securities Portfolio 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average contractual interest rate on our interest earning Debt Securities Portfolio was approximately 11.9 and 12.5 , respectively. 
 The debt investment portfolio (excluding our investments in the CLO Funds and Joint Ventures) at September 30, 2024 was spread across 28 different industries and 72 different portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately 347.0 million and average par balance per entity of approximately 2.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, nine of our investments were on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2023, seven of our investments were on non-accrual status. 
 Asset Manager Affiliates 
 As of September 30, 2024, our remaining asset management affiliates (the Asset Manager Affiliates have limited operations and are expected to be liquidated. As of September 30, 2024, the Asset Manager Affiliates manage CLO Funds that invest in broadly syndicated loans, high yield bonds and other credit instruments. 
 CLO Fund Securities 
 We have made minority investments in the subordinated securities or preferred shares of CLO Funds managed by the Disposed Manager Affiliates and may selectively invest in securities issued by CLO Funds managed by other asset management companies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the CLO Fund Securities was 6.8 million and 9.0 million, respectively. 
 The CLO Funds invest primarily in broadly syndicated non-investment grade loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments of corporate issuers. The underlying assets in each of the CLO Fund Securities in which we have an investment are generally diversified secured or unsecured corporate debt. 
 The structure of CLO Funds, which are highly levered, is extremely complicated. Since we primarily invest in securities representing the residual interests of CLO Funds, our investments are much riskier than the risk profile of the loans by which such CLO Funds are collateralized. Our investments in CLO Funds may be riskier and less transparent to us and our stockholders than direct investments in the underlying loans. For a more detailed discussion of the risks related to our investments in CLO Funds, please see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investments Our investments may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Investment in Joint Ventures 
 KCAP Freedom 3 LLC 
 During the third quarter of 2017, we and Freedom 3 Opportunities LLC Freedom 3 Opportunities ), an affiliate of Freedom 3 Capital LLC, entered into an agreement to create KCAP Freedom 3 LLC (the F3C Joint Venture ). The fund capitalized by the F3C Joint Venture invests primarily in middle-market loans and the F3C Joint Venture partners may source middle-market loans from time-to-time for the fund. 
 We own a 62.8 economic interest in the F3C Joint Venture. The F3C Joint Venture is structured as an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company. All portfolio and other material decisions regarding the F3C Joint Venture must be submitted to its board of managers, which is comprised of four members, two of whom were selected by us and two of whom were selected by Freedom 3 Opportunities, and must be approved by at least one member appointed by us and one appointed by Freedom 3 Opportunities. In addition, certain matters may be approved by the F3C Joint Venture s investment committee, which is comprised of one member appointed by us and one member appointed by Freedom 3 Opportunities. 
 We have determined that the F3C Joint Venture is an investment company under Accounting Standards Codification ASC ), Financial Services Investment Companies ASC 946 ), however, in accordance with such guidance, we will generally not consolidate our investment in a company other than a wholly owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. We do not consolidate its interest in the F3C Joint Venture because we do not control the F3C Joint Venture due to allocation of the voting rights among the F3C Joint Venture partners. 
 The fair value of the Company s investment in the F3C Joint Venture as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 13.0 million and 14.3 million, respectively. 
 Series A Great Lakes Funding II LLC 
 In August 2022, we invested in Series A Great Lakes Funding II LLC (the Great Lakes II Joint Venture, collectively with the F3C Joint Venture the Joint Ventures ), a joint venture with an investment strategy to underwrite and hold senior, secured unitranche loans made to middle-market companies. We treat our investment in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture as a joint venture since an affiliate of the Adviser controls a 50 voting interest in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture. In connection with the launch of the Great Lakes II Joint Venture, we entered into a series of transactions pursuant to which our prior investment in BCP Great Lakes Holdings LP, a vehicle formed as a co-investment vehicle to facilitate the participation of certain co-investors to invest, directly or indirectly, in BCP Great Lakes Funding, LLC (the Prior Great Lakes Joint 
 47 

Venture ), and the corresponding assets held by the Prior Great Lakes Joint Venture in respect of our investment in BCP Great Lakes Holdings LP, were transferred to the Great Lakes II Joint Venture in complete redemption of our investment in BCP Great Lakes Holdings LP. 
 The Great Lakes II Joint Venture is a Delaware series limited liability company, and pursuant to the terms of the Great Lakes Funding II LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement (the Great Lakes II LLC Agreement ), prior to the end of the investment period with respect to each series established under the Great Lakes II LLC Agreement, each member of the predecessor series would be offered the opportunity to roll its interests into any subsequent series of the Great Lakes II Joint Venture. We do not pay any advisory fees in connection with our investment in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture. Certain other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates have also invested in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture. 
 The fair value of our investment in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was 39.3 million and 45.0 million, respectively. Fair value has been determined utilizing the practical expedient pursuant to ASC 820-10. Pursuant to the terms of the Great Lakes II LLC Agreement, we generally may not effect any direct or indirect sale, transfer, assignment, hypothecation, pledge or other disposition of or encumbrance upon our interests in the Great Lakes II Joint Venture, except that we may sell or otherwise transfer our interests with the consent of the managing members of the Great Lakes II Joint Venture or to an affiliate or a successor to substantially all of our assets. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an unfunded commitment of 11.2 million and 5.5 million to the Great Lakes II Joint Venture, respectively. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss) and net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, distributions, fees, and other investment income and our operating expenses. Net realized gain (loss) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. 
 Set forth below is a discussion of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Revenues consist primarily of investment income from interest and dividends on our investment portfolio and various ancillary fees related to our investment holdings. Investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 15.2 million and 18.6 million, respectively. Investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 48.0 million and 58.5 million, respectively. 
 Interest from Investments in Debt Securities . We generate interest income from our investments in debt securities that consist primarily of senior and junior secured loans. Our Debt Securities Portfolio is spread across multiple industries and geographic locations and, as such, we are broadly exposed to market conditions and business environments. As a result, although our investments are exposed to market risks, we continuously seek to limit concentration of exposure in any particular sector or issuer. 
 The majority of investment income is attributable to interest income, inclusive of payment-in-kind income, on our Debt Securities Portfolio. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 12.7 million and 15.8 million, respectively, of investment income was attributable to interest income, inclusive of payment-in-kind income, on our Debt Securities Portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 40.4 million and 48.1 million, respectively, of investment income was attributable to interest income, inclusive of payment-in-kind income, on our Debt Securities Portfolio. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average contractual interest rate on our interest earning Debt Securities Portfolio was approximately 11.9 and 12.5 , respectively. 
 Investment income is primarily dependent on the composition and credit quality of our investment portfolio. Generally, our Debt Securities Portfolio is expected to generate predictable, recurring interest income in accordance with the contractual terms of each loan. Corporate equity securities may pay a dividend and may increase in value for which a gain may be recognized; generally, such dividend payments and gains are less predictable than interest income on our loan portfolio.

Investment income is comprised of coupon interest, accretion of discount and accelerated accretion resulting from paydowns and other revenue earned from operations. Recent acquisitions of GARS (October 2020) and HCAP (June 2021) have had a significant positive impact on earnings as a result of amortization of purchase discount established at the time of the merger. The table below illustrates that impact:

Core investment income excludes the impact of purchase discount accretion in connection with the GARS and HCAP mergers which is investment income as determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ), excluding the impact of purchase discount accretion associated with the GARS and HCAP mergers. We believe presenting investment income excluding the impact of the GARS and HCAP merger-related purchase discount amortization and the related per share amount is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure for analyzing our financial performance due to the unique circumstance giving rise to the purchase accounting adjustment. However, this measure is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for net investment income and other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, this measure should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Portman Ridge s financial performance. A reconciliation of net investment income in accordance with U.S. GAAP to net investment income excluding the impact of purchase accounting is detailed in the table above. 
 Investment Income on Investments in CLO Fund Securities . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 0.3 million and 0.5 million, respectively, of investment income was attributable to investments in CLO Fund Securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 1.3 million and 1.9 million, respectively, of investment income was attributable to investments in CLO Fund Securities. We generate investment income from our investments in the securities (typically preferred shares or subordinated securities) of CLO Funds. CLO Funds invest primarily in broadly syndicated non-investment grade loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments of corporate issuers. The underlying assets in each of the CLO Funds in which we have an investment are generally diversified secured or unsecured corporate debt. Our CLO Fund Securities that are subordinated securities or preferred shares junior securities are subordinated to senior note holders who typically receive a return on their investment at a fixed spread relative to the SOFR index. The CLO Funds are leveraged funds and any excess cash flow or excess spread (interest earned by the underlying securities in the fund less payments made to senior bond holders and less fund expenses and management fees) is paid to the holders of the CLO Fund s subordinated securities or preferred shares. The level of excess spread from CLO Fund Securities can be impacted by the timing and level of the resetting of the benchmark interest rate for the underlying assets (which reset at various times throughout the quarter) in the CLO Fund and the related CLO Fund note liabilities (which reset at each quarterly distribution date); in periods of short-term and volatile changes in the benchmark interest rate, the levels of excess spread and resulting cash distributions to us can vary significantly. 
 Interest income on investments in CLO equity investments is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets ASC 325-40 ), based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated projected future cash flows due to changes in prepayments and/or re-investments, credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield prospectively over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in our U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP statement of operations differs from both the tax basis investment income and from the cash distributions actually received by us during the period. As a RIC, we anticipate a timely distribution of our tax-basis taxable income. 
 Investments in Joint Ventures. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.7 million and 2.1 million, respectively, in investment income from our investments in Joint Ventures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 5.1 million and 6.9 million, respectively, in investment income from our investments in Joint Ventures. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our investments in Joint Ventures was approximately 52.3 million and 59.3 million, respectively. The final determination of the tax attributes of distributions from Joint Ventures is made on an annual (full calendar year) basis at the end of the year based upon taxable income and distributions for the full year. Therefore, any estimate of tax attributes of distributions made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for the full year. 
 Fees and other income . Origination fees (to the extent services are performed to earn such income upon closing), amendment fees, consent fees, and other fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when they are earned. Prepayment penalties received by the Company for debt instruments repaid prior to maturity date are recorded as income upon receipt. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively, of investment income was attributable to fees and other income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 0.5 million and 1.7 million, respectively, of investment income was attributable to fees and other income.

Subject to market conditions, we intend to grow our portfolio of assets by raising additional capital, including through the prudent use of leverage available to us. As a BDC, we are limited in the amount of leverage we can incur under the 1940 Act. Effective March 29, 2019, we are allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after such borrowing. Because we also recognize the need to have funds available for operating our business and to make investments, we seek to have adequate liquidity at all times to cover normal cyclical swings in funding availability and to allow us to meet abnormal and unexpected funding requirements. As a result, we may hold varying amounts of cash and other short-term investments from time-to-time for liquidity purposes.

 We use borrowed funds, known as leverage, to make investments and to attempt to increase returns to our shareholders by reducing our overall cost of capital. As a BDC, we are limited in the amount of leverage we can incur under the 1940 Act. We are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 267.5 million of par value of outstanding borrowings and our asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings was 170 , compliant with the minimum asset coverage level of 150 generally required for a BDC by the 1940 Act. We may also borrow amounts of up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes. 
 The Small Business Credit Availability Act (the SBCA has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200 to an asset coverage ratio of 150 , if certain requirements are met. On March 29, 2018, the Board, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of its Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCA. As a result, our asset coverage requirements for senior securities changed from 200 to 150 , effective as of March 29, 2019. 
 Outstanding Notes 
 During the second quarter of 2021, we issued 108.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.875 Notes due 2026. The net proceeds for the 4.875 Notes due 2026, after the payment of underwriting expenses, were approximately 104.6 million. Interest on the 4.875 Notes due 2026 is paid semi-annually on April 30 and October 30, at a rate of 4.875 . The 4.875 Notes due 2026 mature on April 30, 2026 and are general unsecured obligations. The indenture governing the 4.875 Notes Due 2026 contains certain restrictive covenants, including compliance with certain provisions of the 1940 Act relating to borrowing and dividends. At September 30, 2024, there was approximately 108.0 million of principal amount outstanding, and we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants on the 4.875 Notes due 2026. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On December 18, 2019, Great Lakes Portman Ridge Funding LLC GLPRF LLC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association JPM ). JPM serves as administrative agent, U.S. Bank National Association serves as collateral agent, securities intermediary and collateral administrator, and the Company serves as portfolio manager under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 GLPRF LLC is required to utilize a minimum of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. Unused amounts below such minimum utilization amount accrue interest as if such amounts are outstanding as borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, GLPRF LLC pays a non-usage fee during the reinvestment period on the average daily unborrowed portion of the financing commitments in excess of such minimum utilization amount. 
 The initial principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility was 115 million. The Revolving Credit Facility has an accordion feature, subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, which could bring total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to up to 215 million. Proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used to fund portfolio investments by GLPRF LLC and to make advances under delayed draw term loans where GLPRF LLC is a lender. 
 On April 29, 2022, GLPRF LLC amended the Revolving Credit Facility with JPM as administrative agent. The amended agreement replaced three-month SOFR as the benchmark interest rate and reduced the applicable margin to 2.80 per annum from 2.85 per annum. 
 On July 23, 2024, GLPRF LLC amended the Revolving Credit Facility with JPM as administrative agent. The amended agreement, among other things, (i) provided for a committed increase to the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount not to exceed 85.0 million, for a total commitment of 200.0 million, which increase became effective on August 20, 2024, (ii) provided for a committed seven-day bridge advance in an aggregate principal amount of 18,250,000, which advance became effective on August 20, 2024, (iii) reduced the applicable margin on the Revolving Credit Facility to 2.50 per annum, (iv) extended the period in which the Company may request advances under the Revolving Credit Facility to August 29, 2026, (v) extended the stated maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to August 29, 2027, (vi) reduced the requirement to utilize a minimum of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to 70 , (vii) reduced the non-usage fee applicable during the reinvestment period to 0.55 per annum on the average daily unborrowed portion of the financing commitments in excess of the minimum utilization amount, (viii) extended the non-call period under the Revolving Credit Facility to April 29, 2025, and (ix) provided for certain fees to be paid to the administrative agent and the lenders in connection therewith. 
 GLPRF LLC s obligations to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of GLPRF LLC s portfolio of investments and cash. The obligations of GLPRF LLC under the Revolving Credit Facility are non-recourse to the Company, and the Company s exposure under the Revolving Credit Facility is limited to the value of the Company s investment in GLPRF LLC. 
 52 

In connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, GLPRF LLC has made certain customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default for similar financing transactions, including if a change of control of GLPRF LLC occurs or if the Company is no longer the portfolio manager of GLPRF LLC. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, JPM may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility immediately due and payable. 
 The occurrence of an event of default (as described above) or a market value event (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) triggers a requirement that GLPRF LLC obtain the consent of JPM prior to entering into certain sales or dispositions with respect to portfolio assets, and the occurrence of a market value event triggers the right of JPM to direct GLPRF LLC to enter into sales or dispositions with respect to any portfolio assets, in each case in JPM s sole discretion. 
 At September 30, 2024, GLPRF LLC was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and there was approximately 159.5 million principal amount of borrowings was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 2018-2 Secured Notes 
 On October 28, 2020, the Company completed the GARS Acquisition, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the GARS Merger Agreement. In connection therewith, the Company now consolidates the financial statements the 2018-2 CLO a 420.0 million par value CLO facility. On the date of the transaction the debt assumed was recognized at fair value, resulting in a 2.4 million discount which is amortized over the remaining term of the borrowings. 
 The CLO was executed by GF 2018-2 (the Issuer and Portman Ridge Funding 2018-2 LLC (formerly known as Garrison Funding 2018-2 LLC, together with the Issuer, the Co-Issuers who issued 312.0 million of senior secured notes (collectively referred to as the 2018-2 Secured Notes and 108.0 million of subordinated notes (the 2018-2 Subordinated Notes and, together with the 2018-2 Secured Notes, the 2018-2 Notes backed by a diversified portfolio of primarily senior secured loans. The Company owns all 108.0 million of the par value of the 2018-2 Subordinated Notes and 18.3 million of the par value of the Class B-R Notes and serves as collateral manager for the Co-Issuers. The Company is entitled to receive interest from the Class B-R Notes, distributions from the 2018-2 Subordinated Notes and fees for serving as collateral manager in accordance with the CLO s governing documents and to the extent funds are available for such purposes. However, as a result of retaining all of the 2018-2 Subordinated Notes, the Company consolidates the accounts of the Co-Issuers into its financial statements and all transactions between the Company and the Co-Issuers are eliminated on consolidation. As a result of this consolidation, the 2018-2 Secured Notes issued by the CLO is treated as the Company s indebtedness, except any 2018-2 Secured Notes owned by the Company, which are eliminated in consolidation. The 2018-2 Notes are scheduled to mature on November 20, 2029, however the Co-Issuers may redeem the 2018-2 Notes on any business day after November 20, 2020. The indenture governing the 2018-2 Notes provides that, to the extent cash is available from cash collections, the holders of the 2018-2 Notes are to receive quarterly interest payments on the 20th day or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day of February, May, August and November of each year until the stated maturity or earlier redemption. On July 18, 2019, 25.0 million outstanding of the aggregate 50.0 million Class A-1R-R Notes available under the CLO converted to Class A-1T-R Notes. On November 18, 2022, the Company drew 14.3 million of the 25 million unfunded Class A-1 R-R Notes. The Reinvestment Period ended on November 20, 2022, and the remaining amount of the unfunded Class A-1 R-R Notes terminated. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed approximately 88.0 million of the 2018-2 Secured Notes. In connection therewith, the Company recognized a realized loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 0.9 million. During 2023, the Company redeemed approximately 52.5 million of the par value of the 2018-2 Secured Notes. In connection therewith, the Company recognized a realized loss on extinguishment of approximately 0.4 million. 
 On August 20, 2024, an optional redemption of the CLO occurred and all rated notes were repaid in full. As of September 30, 2024, no 2018-2 Secured Notes were outstanding. 
 Accordingly, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed approximately 85.1 million of the par value of 2018-2 Secured Notes. In connection therewith, the Company recognized a realized loss on extinguishment of approximately 0.4 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company redeemed approximately 125.7 million of the par value of 2018-2 Secured Notes. In connection therewith, the Company recognized a realized loss on extinguishment of approximately 0.7 million.

Stockholder Distributions 
 We intend to continue to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders. To avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we generally endeavor to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our ordinary net taxable income for the calendar year; 

98.2 of our capital gains, if any, in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and 

any net ordinary income and net capital gains for the preceding year that were not distributed during such year and on which we do not pay corporate tax. 

We may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income, to the extent required. 
 The amount of our declared distributions, as evaluated by management and approved by our Board, is based primarily on our evaluation of our net investment income and distributable taxable income. 
 We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the election of stockholders are treated as taxable dividends. The Internal Revenue Service has published guidance indicating that this rule will apply even where the total amount of cash that may be distributed is limited to no more than 20 of the total distribution. Under this guidance, if too many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). If we decide to make any distributions consistent with this guidance that are payable in part in our stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, shares of our stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. 
 We are also prohibited by the 1940 Act and the indenture governing our 4.875 Notes due 2026 from declaring dividends (except a dividend payable in our stock) or making distributions on our common stock, or purchasing any such stock, if, at the time of declaration or at the time of any such purchase, our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is below the threshold specified in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions thereto of the 1940 Act, after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, and giving effect, in each case (i) to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC and (ii) to any no-action relief granted by the SEC to another BDC (or to the Company if it determines to seek such similar no-action or other relief) permitting the BDC to declare any cash dividend or distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act in order to maintain its status as a RIC under the Code. In any such event, we would be prohibited from making distributions required in order to maintain our status as a RIC unless made in accordance with any such exemptive or no-action relief granted by the SEC.

Stock Repurchase Program 
 On March 6, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a 10 million stock repurchase program (the Stock Repurchase Program for an approximately one-year period, effective March 6, 2023 and terminating on March 31, 2024. Under this repurchase program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise subject to any law or agreement to which we are party including any restrictions under the 1940 Act and in the indenture for our 4.875 Notes due 2026. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, and economic and market conditions. This Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. On March 11, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a renewed stock repurchase program of up to 10 million (the Renewed Stock Repurchase Program for an approximately one-year period, effective March 11, 2024 and terminating on March 31, 2025. The terms and conditions of the Renewed Stock Repurchase Program are substantially similar to the prior Stock Repurchase Program. The Renewed Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Subject to these restrictions, we will selectively pursue opportunities to repurchase shares which are accretive to net asset value per share. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 33,429 shares under the Renewed Stock Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of approximately 0.6 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 60,559 shares under the Stock Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of approximately 1.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 164,166 shares under the Renewed Stock Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of approximately 3.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 123,253 shares under the Stock Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of approximately 2.6 million. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 From time-to-time we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the needs of our investment in portfolio companies. Such instruments include commitments to extend credit and may involve, in varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of amounts recognized on our balance sheet. Prior to extending such credit, we attempt to limit our credit risk by conducting extensive due diligence, obtaining collateral where necessary and negotiating appropriate financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 31.7 million and 28.6 million commitments to fund investments, respectively. We may also enter into derivative contracts with off-balance sheet risk in connection with its investing activities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, complex, or subjective judgments. Our critical accounting policies are those applicable to the basis of presentation, valuation of investments, and certain revenue recognition matters as discussed below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Significant Accounting Policies Investments contained elsewhere herein. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. 
 Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of 1940 Act, is (1) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (2) for all other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser pursuant to procedures approved by our Board. In December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which permits a BDC's board of directors to designate its investment adviser as a valuation designee to determine the fair value for its investment portfolio, subject to the active oversight of the board. Our Board has designated our Adviser as its valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, and in that role our Adviser is responsible for performing fair value determinations relating to all of the Company's investments, including periodically assessing and managing any material valuation risks and establishing and applying fair value methodologies, in accordance with valuation policies and procedures that have been approved by the Board. Our Board remains ultimately responsible for making fair value determinations under the 1940 Act and satisfies its responsibility through oversight of the valuation designee in accordance with Rule 2a-5. Our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio based on the nature of the security, the market for the security and other considerations including the financial performance and enterprise value of the portfolio company. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the Adviser determined values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments, and the differences could be material. 
 Pursuant to ASC 946: Financial Services Investment Companies ASC 946 ), we reflect our investments on our balance sheet at their determined fair value with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of unrealized gains or losses on our statements of operations. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell the investments in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., the exit price). 
 See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the additional information about the level of market observability associated with investments carried at fair value. 
 We follow the provisions of ASC 820: Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820: Fair Value ), which among other matters, requires enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. This standard defines fair value and establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. ASC 820: Fair Value defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This fair value definition focuses on an exit price in the principle, or most advantageous market, and prioritizes, within a measurement of fair value, the use of market-based inputs (which may be weighted or adjusted for relevance, reliability and specific attributes relative to the subject investment) over entity-specific inputs. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 820: Fair Value, the FASB has issued various staff positions clarifying the initial standard (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements: Significant Accounting Policies Investments ). 
 55 

ASC 820: Fair Value establishes the following three-level hierarchy, based upon the transparency of inputs to the fair value measurement of an asset or liability as of the measurement date: 
 Level I Unadjusted quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The type of investments included in Level I include listed equities and listed securities. As required by ASC 820: Fair Value, we do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price. 

Level II Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Such inputs may be quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full character of the financial instrument, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market information. Investments which are generally included in this category include illiquid debt securities and less liquid, privately held or restricted equity securities, for which some level of recent trading activity has been observed. 

Level III Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs may be based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability or may use Level II inputs, as adjusted, to reflect specific investment attributes relative to a broader market assumption. These inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data for comparable performance or valuation measures (earnings multiples, discount rates, other financial/valuation ratios, etc.) are available, such investments are grouped as Level III if any significant data point that is not also market observable (private company earnings, cash flows, etc.) is used in the valuation methodology. 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We assess of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the investment. The majority of our investments are classified as Level III. We evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading, in determining fair value. Inputs that are backed by actual transactions, those that are highly correlated to the specific investment being valued and those derived from reliable or knowledgeable sources will tend to have a higher weighting in determining fair value. Our fair value determinations may include factors such as an assessment of each underlying investment, its current and prospective operating and financial performance, consideration of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information, including comparable transactions, performance factors, and other investment or industry specific market data, among other factors. 
 We have valued our investments, in the absence of observable market prices, using the valuation methodologies described below applied on a consistent basis. For some investments, little market activity may exist; management s determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances, and may incorporate management s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of management s judgment. 
 Our investments in CLO Fund Securities are carried at fair value, which is based either on (i) the present value of the net expected cash inflows for interest income and principal repayments from underlying assets and the cash outflows for interest expense, debt paydown and other fund costs for the CLO Funds which are approaching or past the end of their reinvestment period and therefore are selling assets and/or using principal repayments to pay-down CLO Fund debt, and for which there continue to be net cash distributions to the class of securities we own, or (ii) a discounted cash flow model that utilizes prepayment and loss assumptions based on historical experience and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow and comparable yields for similar securities or preferred shares to those in which we have invested, or (iii) indicative prices provided by the underwriters or brokers who arrange CLO Funds. We recognize unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments in CLO Fund Securities as comparable yields in the market change and/or based on changes in net asset values or estimated cash flows resulting from changes in prepayment or loss assumptions in the underlying collateral pool. As each investment in CLO Fund Securities ages, the expected amount of losses and the expected timing of recognition of such losses in the underlying collateral pool are updated and the revised cash flows are used in determining the fair value of the CLO Fund Securities. We determine the fair value of our investments in CLO Fund Securities on a security-by-security basis. 
 Our investments in our wholly-owned Asset Manager Affiliates are carried at fair value, which is primarily determined utilizing a discounted cash flow model which incorporates different levels of discount rates depending on the hierarchy of fees earned (including the likelihood of realization of senior, subordinate and incentive fees) and prospective modeled performance Discounted Cash Flow ). Such valuation takes into consideration an analysis of comparable asset management companies and a percentage of assets under management. The Asset Manager Affiliates are classified as a Level III investment (as described above). Any change in value from period to period is recognized as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
 We carry investments in joint ventures at fair value based upon the fair value of the investments held by the joint venture. 
 Fair values of other investments for which market prices are not observable are determined by reference to public market or private transactions or valuations for comparable companies or assets in the relevant asset class and/or industry when such amounts are available. Generally, these valuations are derived by multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company or asset (e.g., EBITDA) by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies or transactions, adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparable. Such investments may also be valued at cost for a period of time after an acquisition as the best indicator of fair value. If the fair value of such investments cannot be valued by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies, then the primary analytical method used to estimate the fair value is a discounted cash flow method and/or cap rate analysis. A sensitivity analysis is applied to the estimated future cash flows using various factors depending on the investment, including assumed growth rates (in cash flows), capitalization rates (for determining terminal values) and appropriate discount rates to determine a range of reasonable values or to compute projected return on investment. 
 For bond rated note tranches of CLO Fund securities (those above the junior class) without transactions to support a fair value for the specific CLO Fund and tranche, fair value is based on discounting estimated bond payments at current market yields, which may reflect the adjusted yield on the leveraged loan index for similarly rated tranches, as well as prices for similar tranches for other CLO Funds and also other factors such as indicative prices provided by underwriters or brokers who arrange CLO Funds, and the default and recovery rates of underlying assets in the CLO Fund, as may be applicable. Such model assumptions may vary and incorporate adjustments for risk premiums and CLO Fund specific attributes. 
 We derive fair value for our illiquid loan investments that do not have indicative fair values based upon active trades primarily by using the Income Approach, and also consider recent loan amendments or other activity specific to the subject asset as described above. Other significant assumptions, such as coupon and maturity, are asset-specific and are noted for each investment in the Schedules of Investments. 
 The determination of fair value using this methodology takes into consideration a range of factors, including but not limited to the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. This valuation methodology involves a significant degree of our judgment. 
 Our Adviser may consider other methods of valuation to determine the fair value of investments as appropriate in conformity with GAAP. 
 Interest Income 
 56 

Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount and accrual payment-in-kind PIK interest, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally place a loan on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on such loan or security when a loan or security becomes 90 days or more past due or if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service its debt obligations. For investments with PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible (i.e. via a partial or full non-accrual). Loans which are on partial or full non-accrual remain in such status until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due or such loans become current. As of September 30, 2024, nine of our investments were on non-accrual status. 
 Investment Income on CLO Fund Securities 
 We receive distributions from our investments in the most junior class of securities of CLO Funds (typically preferred shares or subordinated securities). Our CLO Fund junior class securities are subordinated to senior note holders who typically receive a return on their investment at a fixed spread relative to the SOFR index. The CLO Funds are leveraged funds and any excess cash flow or excess spread (interest earned by the underlying securities in the fund less payments made to senior note holders and less fund expenses and management fees) is paid to the holders of the CLO Fund s subordinated securities or preferred shares. The level of excess spread from CLO Fund Securities can be impacted from the timing and level of the resetting of the benchmark interest rate for the underlying assets (which reset at various times throughout the quarter) in the CLO Fund and the related CLO Fund note liabilities (which reset at each quarterly distribution date); in periods of short-term and volatile changes in the benchmark interest rate, the levels of excess spread and distributions to us can vary significantly. In addition, the failure of CLO Funds in which we invest to comply with certain financial covenants may lead to the temporary suspension or deferral of cash distributions to us. 
 GAAP-basis investment income on CLO equity investments is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC 325-40, based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated projected future cash flows due to changes in prepayments and/or re-investments, credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield prospectively over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from both the tax-basis investment income and from the cash distributions actually received by us during the period. For U.S. tax purposes, these CLO equity investments are treated as PFICs. Taxable income is provided on a PFIC statement, where income and capital gains are determined based on the U.S. shareholder's proportionate ownership of the PFIC. 
 For non-junior class CLO Fund Securities interest is earned at a fixed spread relative to the SOFR index. 
 Payment in Kind Interest 
 We may have loans in our portfolio that contain a PIK provision. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income. To maintain our RIC status, this non-cash source of income must be distributed to stockholders in the form of cash dividends, even though we have not yet collected any cash. 
 Fees and other income 
 Origination fees (to the extent services are performed to earn such income upon closing), amendment fees, consent fees, and other fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when they are earned. Prepayment penalties received by the Company for debt instruments repaid prior to maturity date are recorded as income upon receipt. Commitment and facility fees are generally recognized as income over the life of the underlying loan, whereas due diligence, structuring, transaction service and management service fees are generally recognized as income when the services are rendered. 
 United States Federal Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC and intend to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code and, among other things, intend to make the required distributions to our stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, the Company is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income, to the extent required. 
 Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Our business activities contain elements of market risks. We consider our principal market risks to be fluctuations in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. Managing these risks is essential to our business. Accordingly, we have systems and procedures designed to identify and analyze our risks, to establish appropriate policies and thresholds and to continually monitor these risks and thresholds by means of administrative and information technology systems and other policies and processes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing debt and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. 
 Our investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including SOFR and prime rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 91.2 of our Debt Securities Portfolio were either floating rate with a spread to an interest rate index such as SOFR or the prime rate. 88.5 of these floating rate loans contain floors ranging between 0.50 and 5.25 . We generally expect that future portfolio investments will predominately be floating rate investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had 267.5 million (par value) of borrowings outstanding at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.7 , of which 108.0 million par value had a fixed rate and 159.5 million par value has a floating rate. 
 Because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between our borrowing rate and the rate we earn on the invested proceeds borrowed. In periods of rising or lowering interest rates, the cost of the portion of our debt associated with our fixed rate borrowings would remain the same, while the interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would fluctuate with changes in interest rates. 
 Generally, we would expect that an increase in the base rate index for our floating rate investment assets would increase our gross investment income and that a decrease in the base rate index for such assets would decrease our gross investment income (in either case, such increase/decrease may be limited by interest rate floors/minimums for certain investment assets). 
 57 

We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense. Assuming that our balance sheet at September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, the table below illustrates the impact on net investment income on our Debt Securities Portfolio for various hypothetical increases in interest rates: 

Impact on net investment income from a change in interest rates at:

3,501 

5,270 

Decrease in interest rate 

(1,712) 

(3,425) 

(5,072) 

As shown above, net investment income assuming a 1 increase in interest rates would increase by approximately 1.7 million on an annualized basis. If the increase in rates was more significant, such as 2 or 3 , the net effect on net investment income would be an increase of approximately 3.5 million and 5.3 million, respectively. 
 On an annualized basis, a decrease in interest rates of 1 would result in a decrease in net investment income of approximately 1.7 million. A decrease in interest rates of 2 and 3 would result in a decrease in net investment income of approximately 3.4 million and 5.1 million, respectively. The effect on net investment income from declines in interest rates is impacted by interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate investments, as there is no floor on our floating rate debt facility and the 2018-2 Secured Notes. 
 Although management believes that this measure is indicative of sensitivity to interest rate changes on our Debt Securities Portfolio, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect a net change in assets resulting from operations or net income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not materially differ from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate. 
 Portfolio Valuation 
 We carry our investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by our Adviser pursuant to valuation procedures approved by our Board. Investments for which market quotations are generally readily available are generally valued at such market quotations. Investments for which there is not a readily available market value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser under a valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that cannot be marked to market, the fair value of our investments may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the value realized on these investments to be different than the valuations that are assigned. The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing of our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, third party valuations, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly-traded securities, recent sales of or offers to buy comparable companies, and other relevant factors. 
 The Adviser has engaged an independent valuation firm to provide third party valuation consulting services. Each quarter, the independent valuation firm will perform third party valuations on the Company s material investments in illiquid securities such that they are reviewed at least once during a trailing 12-month period. These third-party valuation estimates were considered as one of the relevant data inputs in the Company s determination of fair value. The Adviser intends to continue to engage an independent valuation firm in the future to provide certain valuation services, including the review of certain portfolio assets, as part of the quarterly and annual year-end valuation process. 
 Item 4.	Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of various members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer CEO and its Chief Financial Officer CFO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Acts recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. Othe r Information 
 Item 1. 	 Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings except as set forth below. 
 HCAP and certain of its officers and directors as well as JMP Group LLC were named as defendants in two putative stockholder class action lawsuits, both filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, captioned Stewart Thompson v. Joseph Jolson, et al., Case No. 2021-0164 and Ronald Tornese v. Joseph Jolson, et al., Case No. 2021-0167 (the Delaware Actions ). The complaints in the Delaware Actions allege certain breaches of fiduciary duties against the defendants as well as aiding and abetting claims against JMP Group LLC and HCAP s Chief Executive Officer concerning HCAP s proposed merger with the Company and Acquisition Sub that resulted in the merger with and into the Company. 
 On June 9, 2021, HCAP merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation. As a result, the Company became responsible for any claims against HCAP as well as for any advancement and/or indemnification owed to the former officers and directors of HCAP. On or about May 10, 2022, plaintiffs in the Delaware Actions filed a consolidated amended complaint seeking damages against defendants for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed merger. On or about May 31, 2022, defendants moved to dismiss the Delaware Actions. 
 Thereafter, in December 2022, plaintiffs in the Delaware Actions again amended their complaint, and defendants again moved to dismiss the Delaware Action. On June 7, 2023, the Court heard oral argument on defendants motions to dismiss. The Court dismissed all claims against HCAP s former independent directors but denied the motions of the remaining defendants. 
 On February 26, 2024, the parties in the Delaware Actions entered into a stipulation of settlement pursuant to which all claims will be dismissed with prejudice, subject to approval by the Court. On July 2, 2024, the Court held a settlement hearing and approved the settlement. The claims asserted against the defendants were dismissed with prejudice. The Company will not be responsible for paying any portion of the settlement amount, either directly or through indemnification of former officers or directors of HCAP.

Item 2.	Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Other than the shares issued pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan DRIP ), we did not engage in any sales of unregistered securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, except as previously reported by us on our current reports on Form 8-K. We issued a total of 12,488 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan DRIP during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . This issuance was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the aggregate value of the shares of our common stock issued under our DRIP was approximately 0.2 million.
