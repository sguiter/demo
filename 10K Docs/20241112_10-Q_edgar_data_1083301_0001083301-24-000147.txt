 This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management, and expected market growth are forward-looking statements.

For TeraWulf, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include, without limitation: 
 conditions in the cryptocurrency mining industry, including any prolonged substantial reduction in cryptocurrency prices, and specifically, the value of bitcoin, which could cause a decline in the demand for TeraWulf s services; 
 the number and value of bitcoin rewards and transaction fees we earn from our bitcoin mining operations; 
 future self-mining hash rate capacity; 
 timing of receipt and deployment of miners; 
 competition among the various providers of data mining services; 
 the need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which may be costly or difficult to obtain or may not be obtained (in whole or in part) and, if obtained, could significantly dilute the ownership interests of TeraWulf s shareholders; 
 the ability to implement certain business objectives and the ability to timely and cost-effectively execute integrated projects; 
 adverse geopolitical or economic conditions, including a high inflationary environment; 
 security threats or unauthorized or impermissible access to our data centers, our operations or our digital wallet; 
 counterparty risk with respect to our digital asset custodian and our mining pool provider;

 bitcoin mining facilities: the Lake Mariner Facility located in upstate New York (the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility located in central Pennsylvania (the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility ). The Company s wholly-owned Lake Mariner Facility began mining bitcoin in March 2022 and, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has energized buildings and infrastructure comprising approximately MW of capacity. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, which has been developed and constructed through a joint venture (see Note 11), commenced mining operations in February 2023 and, in April 2023, achieved full energization of the Company s allotted infrastructure capacity of MW. On October 2, 2024, the Company sold its entire equity interest in the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. 
 On December 13, 2021, TeraWulf Inc. completed a strategic business combination (the Merger with IKONICS Corporation IKONICS ), a Minnesota corporation, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company effectively acquired IKONICS and became a publicly traded company on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations Nasdaq ), which was the primary purpose of the business combination. IKONICS traditional business was the development and manufacturing of high-quality photochemical imaging systems for sale primarily to a wide range of printers and decorators of surfaces. As of the date of the Merger, TeraWulf classified the IKONICS business as held for sale and discontinued operations in its condensed consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed sales of substantially all of IKONICS historical net assets (see Note 3). Subsequent to the asset sales, IKONICS name was changed to RM 101 Inc. RM 101 ).

 Significant Accounting Policies 
 Except for the updates noted below, see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a detailed discussion of the Company s significant accounting policies. 
 hours and to continuously renew throughout the day. Additionally, the Company concluded that the mining pool operator s (i.e., the customer s) renewal right is not a material right because the renewal rights do not include any discounts; that is, the terms, conditions, and compensation amounts are at the then-current market rates. 
 There is no significant financing component in these transactions. 
 The mining pool applies the Full Pay Per Share FPPS payout model. Under the FPPS model, in exchange for providing hash computation services to the pool, the Company is entitled to pay-per-share base amount and transaction fee reward compensation, calculated on a daily basis, at an amount that approximates the total bitcoin that could have been mined and transaction fees that could have been awarded using the Company s hash computation services, based upon the then current blockchain difficulty. Under this model, the Company is entitled to compensation, payable in bitcoin, regardless of whether the pool operator successfully records a block to the bitcoin blockchain. 
 The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration and is all variable. Because digital currency is considered noncash consideration, fair value of the digital currency award received would generally be determined using the quoted price of the related digital currency in the Company s principal market at the time of contract inception. The Company has adopted an accounting policy to aggregate individual contracts with individual terms less than -hours within each intraday period and apply a consistent valuation point, the start of day Coordinated Universal Time (00:00:00 UTC), to value the related noncash consideration. Revenue is recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, which is the same day that control of the contracted service transfers to the mining pool, which is the same day as the contract inception. After every -hour contract term, the mining pool transfers the digital currency consideration to our designated digital currency wallet.

 to increase the balance of digital currency with a corresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated deficit in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2024. 
 As a result of adopting ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2024, the Company measures digital currency at fair value as of each reporting period in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that the Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for bitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all information that is reasonably available. Since bitcoin is traded on a 24-hour period, the Company utilizes the price as of midnight UTC time, which aligns with the Company's revenue recognition policy. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of digital currency are included within gain on fair value of digital currency, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company sells bitcoin and gains and losses from such transactions, measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the cost basis of bitcoin as determined on a first-in-first-out basis, are also included within gain on fair value of digital currency, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded gain on fair value of digital currency, net of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, the Company accounted for digital currency as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. The Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and to track its bitcoin activity daily for impairment assessment purposes. The Company determined the fair value of its bitcoin on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820 based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that the Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for bitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all information that was reasonably available. The Company performed an analysis each day to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted price of bitcoin on the active trading platform, indicated that it was more likely than not that its bitcoin were impaired. For impairment testing purposes, the lowest intraday trading price of bitcoin was identified at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of bitcoin and the lowest daily trading price of bitcoin represented a recognized impairment loss. To the extent an impairment loss was recognized, the loss established the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of previously recorded impairment losses was prohibited. The Company recorded impairment of digital currency of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Digital currency received as noncash consideration through the Company s mining activities are included as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The receipt of digital currency as distributions-in-kind from equity investees are included within supplemental disclosures of noncash investing activities. Prior to the repayment of the Term Loans in July 2024 (see Note 9) proceeds from sales of digital currency were included within cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as bitcoin was converted nearly immediately into cash during that period. Subsequently, proceeds from sales of digital currency are included within cash flows from investing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as bitcoin has not been converted nearly immediately into cash. 
 suppliers for the provision of bitcoin miners and mining pool operator. The Company does not believe that these counterparties represent a significant performance risk. Revenue did not exceed 10 for any one data center hosting customer for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue from one data center hosting customer represented and of consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company only operated bitcoin mining facilities; however, the Company has targeted an initial commitment for an allocation of a MW power block at the Lake Mariner Facility intended to support a broader HPC initiative and is also constructing a MW colocation project at the Lake Mariner Facility capable of supporting MW of critical IT load with liquid cooling and redundancy requirements typical of a Tier 3 data center. While the Company may choose to mine other digital currencies, it has no plans to do so currently. If the market value of bitcoin declines significantly, the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company may be adversely affected.

 Overview 
 We are a premier owner and operator of purpose-built digital infrastructure currently supporting bitcoin mining loads. With a strong commitment to utilizing predominantly zero-carbon energy, we are focused on sustainable, environmentally conscious data center operations in the United States. By leveraging clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources, we aim to drive long-term sustainability within the digital infrastructure sector. 
 We operate digital infrastructure through our Lake Mariner facility, located in upstate New York (the Lake Mariner Facility ). Situated on an expansive site along the shores of Lake Ontario, adjacent to a now decommissioned coal-fired power plant, this facility has the capacity to scale up to 500 megawatts MW ), and potentially up to 750 MW with certain transmission upgrades. Uniquely optimized for both bitcoin mining and high-performance computing HPC workloads, the Lake Mariner Facility is well-positioned to meet the growing demand for compute-intensive applications. We believe this dual-purpose strategy enhances operational efficiency and diversifies our revenue streams. 
 Revenue Structure 
 We are primarily engaged in, and all of our revenues are derived from, bitcoin mining for our own account. Our digital asset mining involves solving complex cryptographic algorithms that validate transactions on the bitcoin blockchain a process known as mining. Competing on a global scale, we aim to complete new blocks on the blockchain to secure bitcoin rewards. With a large fleet of high-performance miners, primarily sourced from Bitmain Technologies Limited, we strive to increase bitcoin production while continuously enhancing operational efficiencies to reduce costs. We generate revenue by providing hash computation services to a mining pool operator to mine bitcoin and validate transactions using application-specific integrated circuit computers ASIC or miners owned by us. Beyond block rewards, we also earn transaction fees for confirming blockchain transactions. These earnings are routinely converted into U.S. dollars. Presently, we liquidate the bitcoin mined as part of our routine treasury management processes to acquire U.S. dollars for operational, capital, or other corporate expenses. Our bitcoin holdings are securely stored in a cold storage wallet managed by our custodian, NYDIG Trust Company LLC, a duly chartered New York limited liability trust company NYDIG ). 
 For our bitcoin mining operations, we utilize a third-party mining pool operated by Foundry Digital LLC Foundry ). At the close of each day, the bitcoin we have earned is transferred by Foundry to our custodial wallet address at NYDIG. We abstain from engaging in the direct sale of our bitcoin on any exchange. Instead, we rely on NYDIG to handle the sale of our mined bitcoin in accordance with our execution agreement with NYDIG, as detailed further in the Risk Factors section herein. Our bitcoin sales occur on a daily and weekly basis. 
 Bitcoin and Blockchain 
 Bitcoin, introduced in 2008, fundamentally transformed the landscape of digital currency by providing a decentralized mechanism for exchanging and preserving value. It operates on a consensus-based network, utilizing a public ledger termed as the blockchain to meticulously record every bitcoin transaction, allowing users to send and receive payments without the need for banks and other intermediaries. Bitcoin is not linked to any fiat currency or country s monetary policy, therefore serves as a store of value outside of government control. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 Bitcoin mining involves validating transactions through a proof-of-work consensus method, where miners solve complex mathematical problems to add transactions to the blockchain. The blockchain is maintained by a robust and public open-source architecture consisting of a network of computers, known as nodes, that work together to verify and validate new transactions. Because the blockchain is decentralized and transparent, all users can verify the legitimacy of a transaction without having to rely on a third party. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, which can be slow and expensive, and makes the network resistant to censorship and fraud. Bitcoin mining plays a key role in the maintenance and growth of the Bitcoin network by providing the computational power needed to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Factors such as computing capacity, electricity costs, and location play pivotal roles in mining operations. Generally, the greater the share a single mining rig can capture of the blockchain s total network hashrate, or the aggregate hashrate deployed to solving a block on the Bitcoin blockchain, the greater the rig s chances of solving a block and therefore earning the reward. 
 Network difficulty, which is a measure of how hard it is for miners to solve a block on the Bitcoin blockchain (and, thus, earn a mining reward), is determined by the network s total hashrate (i.e., the total computational power devoted to solving a block), which is adjusted every 2,016 blocks (with a new block being added approximately every ten minutes). Therefore, as more miners join the network and the network s global hashrate increases, its difficulty will increase. Conversely, if miners leave the network and its hashrate decreases, its difficulty will decrease. 
 Bitcoin Reward Halving 
 The bitcoin subsidy issued by the Bitcoin network for solving a block is subject to periodic incremental halving. The network halving is a preprogrammed, fixed process of the Bitcoin network where the bitcoin subsidy for solving a block received by miners is reduced by half approximately every four years. The network halving is a process designed to implement a periodic decreasing schedule of the issuance of new bitcoin into the market, which results in a predictable and controlled inflationary rate. The network halving will continue to occur on this schedule until the amount of bitcoin in existence reaches the cap of 21.0 million. After each halving, the decrease in the subsidy provided to miners from the Bitcoin network leads to fewer rewards for miners and therefore a decrease in revenues should the price of bitcoin remain the same. Transaction fees, which together with the block subsidy comprise the block reward for successfully solving a block, is not directly impacted by the halving. On April 19, 2024, the bitcoin rewards issued for each block solved dropped from 6.25 to 3.125, effectively reducing the bitcoin earned from bitcoin mining by 50 (excluding transactions fee rewards). 
 Business Strategy 
 In December 2023, we launched our digital infrastructure and third-party colocation initiative, which aims to provide colocation, facility operations, security, and essential services for workloads in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other compute-intensive fields. While capital investments have been made to develop our HPC data center infrastructure, this investment is still in its early stages and is not yet generating revenue. Nonetheless, this initiative reinforces our long-term growth and diversification strategy, positioning us to meet the increasing demand for high-density compute capacity powered by low-cost, predominantly zero-carbon energy. 
 Since our public debut in December 2021, we have primarily focused on sustainable bitcoin mining as our principal revenue-generating activity. As of September 30, 2024, we deployed a fleet of 74,200 miners, including miners deployed at our jointly owned Nautilus facility located in central Pennsylvania (the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility ), achieving a hashrate capacity of approximately 10.0 exahashes per second EH/s with a fleet-wide efficiency of 23.2 joules per terahash J/TH ). In October 2024, we sold our 25 equity interest in the Nautilus Cryptomine LLC Nautilus joint venture, representing 50 MW of mining load capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, as part of a strategic transaction to reinvest in future growth. 
 We determine the sources of electricity used in our operations and the proportion of energy attributable to zero-carbon energy sources based on energy production data published by New York Independent System Operator NYISO for upstate New York, specifically covering NYISO Zones A-E, where the Lake Mariner Facility is located, consistent with recommended geographic resolution for projected emissions factors for upstate New York published by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. 
 Our business strategy centers on growing revenue and profitability by enhancing the capacity and efficiency of our self-mining fleet while expanding our data center infrastructure to support HPC activities. We plan to strategically develop the infrastructure necessary for growth and profitability while pursuing adjacent high-value computing opportunities that leverage our power and mining expertise.

 For example, we recently completed a 2.5 MW HPC proof-of-concept project designed to support both current and next-generation GPU technology. Additionally, we are constructing a 20 MW colocation building CB-1 ), a facility designed with advanced liquid cooling systems and Tier 3 redundancy. Key planned features include N+1 redundant cooling systems, variable speed fans, chilled water infrastructure, dual power supplies, and redundant fiber network paths. 
 CB-1 is scheduled to be operational by the first quarter of 2025. Following this, a second colocation building CB-2 with a planned gross capacity of 50 MW, is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2025. Planned capital expenditures associated with CB-1 will be funded in part from proceeds from the sale of our equity stake in the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, which was completed on October 2, 2024, and we expect that proceeds from the private offering of 2.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the 2030 Convertible Notes will substantially fund the capital expenditures associated with CB-2. Once CB-1 and CB-2 are operational, we anticipate adding approximately 178 MW of additional HPC data center capacity throughout 2025, bringing the total deployed capacity at the site to around 500 MW, with the capacity approximately divided between bitcoin mining and HPC workloads. 
 These initiatives mark significant progress in our HPC build-out, tapping into the rapidly growing hyperscale data center market. We believe that HPC hosting aligns with our current business model, leading to stable, long-term, and high-margin revenue. 
 We are confident that our expertise in power infrastructure and digital asset mining can be favorably applied to the design, development, and operation of large-scale data centers. These data centers are optimized for high-value applications such as cloud computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We will actively seek opportunities to expand into these areas using our knowledge, expertise, and existing infrastructure wherever favorable market opportunities arise. 
 Our Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, TeraWulf conducted its bitcoin mining operations at two established data centers: the Lake Mariner Facility in upstate New York and the jointly owned Nautilus Cryptomine Facility located in central Pennsylvania, which had a combined operating capacity of 10.0 EH/s with approximately 74,200 miners deployed, comprised of 58,400 deployed miners at the Lake Mariner Facility and 15,800 deployed at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company has a total operational bitcoin mining capacity of approximately 195 MW at the Lake Mariner Facility and is currently constructing an additional 50 MW facility, which we expect to be operational in the first quarter of 2025. 
 The Lake Mariner Facility 
 Located at a site adjacent to the now decommissioned coal-fired power plant in Barker, New York, the Lake Mariner Facility began sustainably mining bitcoin in March 2022. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Lake Mariner Facility is operating approximately 195 MW of bitcoin mining capacity and the Company is currently constructing an additional 50 MW, which we expect to be operational in the first quarter of 2025. The Company has an agreement in place with the Power Authority of the State of New York NYPA for 90 MW of high load factor power to support its bitcoin mining operations (the PPA ). The PPA was executed in February 2022 and has a term of ten years from the date of commencement of NYPA s power delivery. The Lake Mariner Facility is situated on an expansive site on the shores of Lake Ontario and has the capacity to scale up to 500 MW, and potentially up to 750 MW with certain transmission upgrades. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we own approximately 58,400 miners of which approximately 55,200 are operational at the Lake Mariner Facility with the remainder undergoing maintenance, awaiting disposal or on standby to replace miners under repair. These miners were comprised as follows:

 As of September 30, 2024, our fleet of miners ranged in age from 0.2 to 2.5 years with an average age of approximately 1.0 years. We do not have scheduled downtime for our miners; however, while we periodically perform unscheduled maintenance on our miners, such downtime has not been significant historically. When performing unscheduled maintenance, depending on the length of estimated repair time, we may replace a miner with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime. As of September 30, 2024, our fleet of miners at the Lake Mariner Facility had a range of energy efficiency from 15 to 31 joules per terahash "j/th and has an average energy efficiency of 22.3 j/th. 
 The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility 
 Located in Berwick, Pennsylvania, Nautilus was a joint venture between TeraWulf and a subsidiary of Talen Energy Corporation Talen (each a Member and collectively the Members ). Nautilus owned and operated a 200 MW bitcoin mining facility located adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt nuclear-powered Susquehanna Station. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility represented the first bitcoin mining facility site that was powered by 100 behind the meter zero-carbon nuclear energy, which was contracted at a fixed rate of 2.0 cents per kilowatt hour kWh for a term of five years with two successive three-year renewal options. Under the Nautilus joint venture agreement and prior to the sale of TeraWulf s interests in Nautilus in October 2024, the Company held a 25 equity interest in Nautilus and Talen held a 75 equity interest, each subject to adjustment based on relative capital contributions. TeraWulf began mining bitcoin at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility in the first quarter of 2023 and, as of September 30, 2024, had an allotted 50 MW of operational bitcoin mining capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 48,000 miners were deployed at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility of which 46,000 were operational. Approximately 15,800 of the deployed miners were attributed to TeraWulf s contributions to Nautilus in order to utilize TeraWulf's allotted 50 MW of bitcoin mining capacity. These miners were comprised as follows:

 Number of miners 
 Bitmain S19 Pro 
 6,300 Bitmain S19 XP 
 7,100 Bitmain S19j Pro 
 2,400 15,800 
 As of September 30, 2024, these miners ranged in age from 1.5 to 1.6 years with an average age of approximately 1.5 years. Nautilus did not have scheduled downtime for our miners; however, while Nautilus periodically performed unscheduled maintenance on miners, such downtime had not been significant historically. When performing unscheduled maintenance, depending on the length of estimated repair time, Nautilus may have replaced a miner with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime. As of September 30, 2024, these miners had a range of energy efficiency from 22 to 30 j/th and an average energy efficiency of 25.5 j/th. While the Company held a 25 equity interest in Nautilus, the distributions of mined bitcoin were determined by each of TeraWulf s and Talen s respective hashrate contributions. Accordingly, the Company had contributed approximately 1.9 EH/s of a total 5.2 EH/s of miners which resulted in an approximate 35.7 of the hashrate share attributed to the Company. In connection with the sale of TeraWulf s interest in Nautilus in October 2024, Nautilus distributed to TeraWulf all of Nautilus right, title and interest in and to all of its miners, as well as certain other related equipment owned by Nautilus.

 As described above, there are a variety of factors that influence our ability to mine bitcoin profitably, including bitcoin s value in USD, mining difficulty global hashrate, power prices, fleet energy efficiency, data center energy efficiency and other factors. The energy efficiency of a mining fleet helps drive profitability, because the most significant direct expense for bitcoin mining is power. We believe we operate a highly efficient fleet of miners. The Company uses the following metrics as indicators of operational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to peer companies. 
 The table below presents our miner efficiency and computing power as compared to the global computing power as of September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 3 Joules of energy required to produce each terahash of processing power 
 4 While nameplate inventory for TeraWulf s two facilities is 10.0 EH/s, inclusive of gross total hosted miners, actual monthly hashrate performance depends on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) performance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin, scheduled outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to participation in various cash generating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and ASIC maintenance and repair. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 our operating hashrate was approximately 1.3 of the total global hashrate, and we received approximately the same percentage of the global blockchain rewards, which as of that date, equaled approximately 6 to 7 bitcoin per day. Ultimately, in order to mine profitably, we work to ensure that these mining rewards cover our direct operating costs.

 (1) Cost to mine one bitcoin is a cash cost metric and does not include depreciation. Although the Company recognizes depreciation with respect to its mining assets, it does not consider depreciation in determining whether it is economical to operate its mining equipment. As a result, the Company does not consider the sunk costs or depreciation of past capital investments in its historical or forecasted breakeven analysis. If depreciation of our miner fleet were factored into the above cost of mining analysis, it would add 28,827 and 20,477 per bitcoin mined for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, bringing the total cost to mine one bitcoin to 59,326 and 41,873 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. If depreciation of our miner fleet were factored into the above cost of mining analysis, it would add 10,002 and 10,025 per bitcoin mined for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, bringing the total cost to mine one bitcoin to 19,354 and 18,076 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Computed as the weighted-average opening price of bitcoin on each respective day the mined bitcoin is earned. Excludes bitcoin earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility. 
 (3) Excludes bitcoin earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility of 0 and 14 bitcoin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6 and 51 bitcoin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and includes TeraWulf s net share of bitcoin mined at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, based on the hashrate share attributed to the Company. 
 (4) Excludes energy expenses associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility and includes TeraWulf s net share of energy expense at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, based on aggregate nameplate power consumption of deployed miners attributed to TeraWulf s contribution to Nautilus. 
 
 Power prices are the most significant cost driver for our bitcoin mining operations, and energy costs represented 49.9 and 36.0 as expressed as a percentage of value of total bitcoin mined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 33.2 and 29.7 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Power prices expressed as a percentage of value of total bitcoin mined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an approximate doubling in network difficulty and the bitcoin reward halving in April 2024, partially offset by increases in average operating hashrate and increases in average value of each bitcoin mined.

 Energy prices can be highly volatile and global events can cause power prices to increase or decrease nationwide. Our wholly-owned Lake Mariner Facility in New York is subject to variable prices and market rate fluctuations with respect to wholesale power costs. Such prices are governed by market power prices and said prices can change hour to hour. While this renders energy prices less predictable, it also gives us greater ability and flexibility to actively manage the energy we consume with an eye towards increasing profitability and energy efficiency. Energy prices are also highly sensitive to weather events, such as winter storms and polar vortices, which increase the demand for power regionally. When such events occur, we may curtail our operations to avoid using power at increased rates or we may be curtailed under demand response programs in which we participate. The average power prices incurred at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility was 0.038 and 0.039 per kWh during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 0.031 per kWh during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The management team makes real-time determinations on the need and timing during which we should curtail. If not otherwise curtailed under demand response programs, we curtail when power prices exceed the value we would receive for the corresponding fixed bitcoin reward. This means if bitcoin s value decrease or energy prices increase, our curtailment will increase; likewise, when bitcoin s value increases and energy prices decrease, our curtailment will decrease. The management team manages this decision on an hour-by-hour basis. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company curtailed operations at the Lake Mariner Facility due to weather events, energy price spikes, and demand response program participation. The Company records expected payments to be received for demand response programs as a reduction in cost of revenue, which amounted to 4.1 million and 7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.7 million and 2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company has purchased all miners with cash and has not used limited recourse equipment financing to complete its miner purchases. The Company has raised capital through both the issuance of equity and corporate level debt. These funds have been utilized to support operations, invest in our joint venture, and purchase miners and other fixed assets. Costs related to such issuances are not included in this analysis. Additionally, miner acquisition costs, or capital expenditures, are not factored into the above cost of mining analysis as capital expenditures do not impact the marginal cost of production of one bitcoin. Miner acquisition costs, or capital expenditures, are generally recorded at cost in property, plant and equipment in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the equipment: generally 4 years for miners and 5 years for computer equipment. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation expense of 0 and 5.1 million, respectively, related to certain miners of which the Company shortened their estimated useful lives based on replacement by April 2024. While we currently depreciate our miners over a 4-year period, given our historical low cost of power, it is possible the average actual useful life of our miners may exceed the depreciation period in certain circumstances. Nevertheless, if depreciation of our miner fleet were factored into the above cost of mining analysis, it would add 28,827 and 20,477 per bitcoin mined in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 10,002 and 10,025 per bitcoin mined in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgement, including consideration of historical operating data, which is limited in the industrial-scale bitcoin mining space given the advent of next-generation mining rigs primarily used by the Company s bitcoin mining operations. Depreciation periods can be adjusted periodically if an event, regulatory action, or change in retirement patterns indicates an update is necessary. Additionally, management considers expected future energy market prices and conditions, operating costs, maintenance practices and capital investment requirements in determining the estimated useful lives of our equipment and reassesses the reasonableness of estimated useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant. When a determination has been made that an asset will be retired or extended before or after the end of its current estimated useful life, depreciation provisions will be accelerated or extended to reflect the shortened or lengthened estimated useful life, which could have a material unfavorable or favorable impact on future results of operations. 
 
 Recent Developments

The increase was primarily due to increased expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year of stock-based compensation of 10.2 million, employee compensation and benefits of 1.0 million, travel expenses of 0.6 million and legal and other professional fees of 0.4 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year of insurance expense of 0.7 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses related party decreased primarily due to performance milestone expense of 2.1 million under the Services Agreement with Beowulf E D for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 15.6 million and 8.2 million, respectively, an increase of 7.4 million. Depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 44.9 million and 20.1 million, respectively, an increase of 24.8 million. The increases were primarily due to the increase in mining capacity due to infrastructure constructed and placed in service between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation expense of 0 and 5.1 million, respectively, related to certain miners of which the Company shortened their estimated useful lives based on expected replacement by April 30, 2024. 
 Gain on fair value of digital currency, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.0 million and 1.6 million, respectively, as a result of the Company adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2023-08, Intangible Goodwill and Other Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2024 which requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently measure such assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, the Company recorded impairment of digital currency of 0.9 million and 2.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, representing the decline in bitcoin prices during the Company s holding period of its bitcoin, which was not reversed during its holding period, and realized gain on sale of digital currency for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.7 million and 1.9 million, respectively, upon subsequent liquidation of bitcoin held. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a cumulative-effect change of 37,000 to increase the balance of digital currency with a corresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated deficit in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2024. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment loss of 0.4 million related to the expected sale of 1,200 miners for proceeds of 0.2 million which were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and included in other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment of 0.4 million related to disposals of miners. 
 Interest expense was 0.4 million and 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 9.9 million. Interest expense relates primarily to the borrowings under the Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement (the LGSA with Wilmington Trust (the Term Loans ), which had an original maturity date of December 1, 2024 and was fully repaid in July 2024 ahead of maturity. Interest expense was 16.8 million and 25.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an decrease of 8.7 million. The decrease in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to repayments of the Term Loans principal balance subsequent to September 30, 2023 resulting in (i) a decrease of amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of 3.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 and (ii) a decrease of 5.5 million in interest expense related to the stated interest rate, which remained unchanged. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt was 4.3 million and 6.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to voluntary prepayments of the Term Loans in February and July 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred prepayment fees of 1.0 million and 1.3 million, respectively, to voluntarily prepay 56.0 million and 74.5 million of the Company s Term Loans, respectively, and the derecognition of unamortized debt discount of 3.3 million and 5.0 million associated with the principal repaid, respectively. The Company made no repayments on the principal balance of the Term Loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Income tax benefit was 0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Based upon the level of historical U.S. losses and future projections over the period in which the net deferred tax assets are deductible, at this time, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the remaining deductible temporary differences, and as a result the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax 
 Equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (2.7) million and 3.4 million, respectively as compared to 0.9 million and (12.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which represents TeraWulf s proportional share of income or losses of Nautilus, which commenced principal operations in February 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount also includes an impairment loss of 0 and 13.6 million, respectively, on the distribution of miners from Nautilus to the Company whereby the miners were marked to fair value from book value on the date distributed. The impairment loss was the result of decreasing prices for miners between initial purchase and distribution. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measure 
 To provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP ), we disclose Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders adjusted for (i) impacts of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred stock dividends, stock-based compensation expense and related party expense to be settled with respect to common stock, all of which are non-cash items that the Company believes are not reflective of its general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv) other income which is related to interest income or income for which management believes is not reflective of the Company s ongoing operating activities; (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, which is not reflective of the Company s general business performance and (vi) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, which is not be applicable to the Company s future business activities. The Company s Adjusted EBITDA also includes the impact of distributions from investee received in bitcoin related to a return on the Nautilus investment, which management believes, in conjunction with excluding the impact of equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company s use in its ongoing operations as a result of its investment in Nautilus. 
 Management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing the Company s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate the Company s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, directors and consultants. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate the Company s bitcoin related revenue. 
 The Company s Adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in the Company s industry, as other companies in the Company s industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company s Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating loss or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Although management utilizes internally and presents Adjusted EBITDA, the Company only utilizes that measure supplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by U.S. GAAP financial results. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 23.9 million, a working capital balance of 0, total stockholders equity of 372.6 million and an accumulated deficit of 303.1 million. The Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company began mining bitcoin in March 2022 and had 10.0 EH/s of operating capacity across the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility as of September 30, 2024. To date, the Company has relied primarily on proceeds from sale of bitcoin, both self-mined and distributed from the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, and its issuances of debt and equity to fund its principal operations. 
 The principal uses of cash are for the operation and buildout of mining facilities, debt service and general corporate activities and, to a lesser extent in 2023, investments in Nautilus joint venture related to mining facility buildout and general corporate activities.

 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was 18.3 million and (6.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 24.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by the increase in mining capacity at the Lake Mariner Facility and increases in the average price of bitcoin, partially offset by increased network hashrate and the effects of the halving in April 2024. 
 Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations was 82.4 million and 44.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company invested 114.3 million and 41.4 million in the buildout of its mining facilities at the Lake Mariner Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company invested 2.8 million, on a net basis, in its joint venture.

 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has one Future Sales and Purchase Agreement (the March 2024 Bitmain Purchase Agreement with Bitmain Technologies Delaware Limited Bitmain Delaware which, as supplemented, provides the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 7,020 PH (approximately 30,000 miners) of S21 Pro miners, pursuant to certain payment timing conditions, by December 31, 2024 for a purchase price of 112.3 million Bitmain Call Option ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had paid Bitmain Delaware 11.2 million, calculated as 10 of the purchase price (the Call Option Fee ). The Call Option Fee shall be applied to the settlement of future down payments of purchases under the Bitmain Call Option, in whole or in part in proportion to the ratio of quantity to be purchased to the maximum PH available under the Bitmain Call Option. In May 2024, the Company exercised an option pursuant to the Bitmain Call Option to purchase 5,000 S21 Pro units and paid Bitmain Delaware an additional 16.8 million for these units. In October 2024, the Company exercised an option pursuant to the Bitmain Call Option to purchase 10,600 S21 Pro units and paid Bitmain Delaware an additional 35.7 million for these units. In October 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 3,200 S21 Pro units to a third party for a purchase price of 12.0 million. 
 The Company was a counterparty to the Amended and Restated Talen Joint Venture Agreement dated August 27, 2022 A/R Joint Venture Agreement ). Under this A/R Joint Venture Agreement, as of September 30, 2024 the Company had invested 102.7 million on a net basis and has right-sized its equity ownership interest to 25 of the joint venture. On October 2, 2024, the Company sold its entire 25 equity interest to the Talen Member for 85.0 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment (the Nautilus Sale ). 
 Financial Condition 
 The Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 44.1 million and generated cash flows from continuing operations of 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had balances of cash and cash equivalents of 23.9 million, a working capital balance of 0, total stockholders equity of 372.6 million and an accumulated deficit of 303.1 million. The Company had 10.0 EH/s of operating capacity across the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility as of September 2024. To date, the Company has relied primarily on proceeds from sales of bitcoin, both self-mined and distributed from the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, and its issuances of debt and equity to fund its principal operations. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company completed (i) a private offering of the 2030 Convertible Notes for an aggregate principal amount of 500.0 million and (ii) the sale of the Company s 25 equity interest in Nautilus for cash proceeds of 85.0 million, the proceeds of which, together with continuing cash flows from operations, are expected to fund strategic development of future infrastructure necessary for growth and profitability in bitcoin mining and data center hosting of HPC workloads.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The above discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. 
 See Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a summary of the Company s significant accounting policies. 
 Digital currency 
 Digital currency is comprised of bitcoin earned as noncash consideration in exchange for providing hash computation services to a mining pool as well as in exchange for data center hosting services. From time to time, the Company also receives bitcoin as distributions-in-kind from its joint venture. Digital currency is included in current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to the Company s ability to sell it in a highly liquid marketplace and because the Company reasonably expects to liquidate its digital currency to support operations within the next twelve months. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08 which requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently measure such assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024. The Company measures digital currency at fair value as of each reporting period in accordance with ASC 820 based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that the Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for bitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all information that is reasonably available. Since bitcoin is traded on a 24-hour period, the Company utilizes the price as of midnight UTC time, which aligns with the Company's revenue recognition policy. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of digital currency are included within gain on fair value of digital currency, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company sells bitcoin and gains and losses from such transactions, measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the cost basis of bitcoin as determined on a first-in-first-out basis, are also included within gain on fair value of digital currency, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, the Company accounted for digital currency as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and to track its bitcoin activity daily for impairment assessment purposes. The Company determined the fair value of its bitcoin on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that the Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for bitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all information that was reasonably available. The Company performed an analysis each day to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted price of bitcoin on the active trading platform, indicated that it was more likely than not that its bitcoin were impaired. For impairment testing purposes, the lowest intraday trading price of bitcoin was identified at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of bitcoin and the lowest daily trading price of bitcoin represented a recognized impairment loss. To the extent an impairment loss was recognized, the loss established the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of previously recorded impairment losses was prohibited.

 Long-lived Assets 
 Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Judgment is necessary in estimating the Company s various assets useful lives. This includes evaluating the Company s own usage experience with its currently owned assets, the quality of materials used in construction-related projects and, for its miners, the rate of technological advancement and market-related factors such as the price of bitcoin and the bitcoin network hashrate, which impact the value of the miners. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally 5 years for computer equipment and 4 years for miners). Leasehold improvements and electrical equipment are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term. Changes in depreciation and amortization, generally accelerated depreciation, are determined and recorded when estimates of the remaining useful lives or residual values of long-term assets change. 
 The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Significant judgment is used when estimating future cash flows, particularly the price of bitcoin and the network hashrate. Any impairment loss recorded is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Should our estimates of useful lives, undiscounted cash flows, or asset fair values change, additional and potentially material impairments may be required, which could have a material impact on our reported financial results. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 The Company measures stock-based compensation cost related to share-based payment awards at the grant date of the award, based on the estimated fair value of the award. For restricted stock units RSUs with time-based vesting, the fair value is determined by the Company s common stock price on the date of the grant. For RSUs with vesting based on market conditions PSUs ), the effect of the market condition is considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Stock-based compensation expense for PSUs is recorded over the derived service period unless the market condition is satisfied in advance of the derived service period, in which case a cumulative catch-up is recognized as of the date of achievement. Stock-based compensation for PSUs is recorded regardless of whether the market conditions are met unless the service conditions are not met. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company uses significant judgment in determining the likelihood of meeting milestones and market conditions. Inputs into valuation models such as Monte Carlo simulations include both the Company s and guideline public company historical and expected annual volatility and, depending on the inputs selected, the Company could calculate significantly different estimated grant date fair values, materially impacting the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense we recognize in future periods. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 , which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provision of ASC 740 related to accounting for uncertain income tax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is more likely than not that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely that not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with the tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the Company s balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The most critical estimate for income taxes is the determination of whether to record a valuation allowance for any net deferred tax asset, including net loss carryforwards, whereby management must estimate whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, TeraWulf may be involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of its business. Some of these proceedings, lawsuits or claims may be material and involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties and could result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. TeraWulf recognizes provisions for claims or pending litigation when it determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. TeraWulf was not subject to any material pending legal and administrative proceedings, lawsuits or claims during the period covered by this Quarterly Report. TeraWulf s business and operations are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against TeraWulf. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business faces many risks. Before deciding whether to invest in our Common Stock, in addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated herein by reference. If any of the risks or uncertainties described therein actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, except for the risk factor noted below. 
 We are and may continue to be subject to short selling strategies. 
 Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, may short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market. 
 We are, and may in the future may be, the subject of unfavorable allegations made by short sellers. For example, in August and October of this year, short sellers published reports that contained certain allegations against us that we believe to be misleading. Any such allegations may be followed by periods of instability in the market price of our shares of common stock and negative publicity. We may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable federal or state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. In addition, any related inquiry or formal investigation from a governmental organization or other regulatory body, including any inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC or the U.S. Department of Justice, could result in a material diversion of our management s time and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming and could distract our management from operating our business. We recently received an inquiry from the SEC relating to the allegations in the recent short seller reports relating to the sources of electricity used in our operations and the proportion of energy attributable to zero-carbon energy sources and, while we believe those allegations to be misleading, we cannot predict the impact that the SEC s inquiry will have on our business and results of operations. SEC investigations are generally fact-finding inquiries and do not necessarily mean that the SEC has concluded that we have violated the federal securities laws or that the SEC has a negative view of the Company. We intend to cooperate fully. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could adversely impact our business, and cause downward pressure and increased volatility in the price of our shares of common stock.
