(21) investment positions in the unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors based upon our analysis of the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, such as bond ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available for sale securities and in consideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. 

As of September 30, 2024, no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on available for sale and held to maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our securities and in consideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. The issuers of these securities are U.S. government agencies who continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Furthermore, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale in the table above and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline.

The Bank believes that these loans are to credit worthy borrowers and are diversified geographically. 

Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 

to of the principal balance. For SBA construction loans, the Company records the guaranteed funded portion of the loans as held for sale. When the SBA loans are fully funded, the Company may sell the guaranteed portion into the secondary market, on a servicing-retained basis, or reclassify from loans held for sale to loans held for investment if the Company determines that holding these loans provide better long-term risk adjusted returns than selling the loans. In calculating gain on the sale of loans, the Company performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portion of the loan. The Company s assumptions are validated by reference to external market information. 

The Company had million and million of SBA/USDA loans held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold the guaranteed portion of one SBA 7(a) loan totaling million, resulting in a gain on sale of loans of ,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold the guaranteed portion of one USDA loan totaling million, resulting in a gain on sale of loans of ,000. There were no loan sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company elected to reclassify million and million, respectively, of the SBA 7(a) loans held for sale to loans held for investment. 

Loan Origination/Risk Management . 

The Company maintains written loan origination policies, procedures, and processes which address credit quality within an acceptable level of risk at several levels including individual loan level, loan type, and loan portfolio levels. 

Commercial and industrial loans, which are predominantly loans to dentists, are underwritten based on historical and projected income of the business and individual borrowers and guarantors. The Company utilizes a comprehensive global debt service coverage analysis to determine debt service coverage ratios. This analysis compares global cash flow of the borrowers and guarantors on an individual credit to existing and proposed debt after consideration of personal and business-related other expenses. Collateral is generally a lien on all available assets of the business borrower including intangible assets. Credit worthiness of individual borrowers and guarantors is established through the use of credit reports and credit scores. 

Consumer loans are evaluated on the basis of credit worthiness as established through the use of credit reports and credit scores. Additional credit quality indicators include borrower debt to income ratios based on verifiable income sources. 

Real estate mortgage loans are evaluated based on collateral value as well as global debt service coverage ratios based on historical and projected income from all related sources including the collateral property, the borrower, and all guarantors where applicable. 

The Company originates SBA loans which are sometimes sold into the secondary market. The Company continues to service these loans after sale and is required under the SBA programs to retain specified amounts. The primary SBA loan programs that the Company offers are the basic SBA 7(a) loan guaranty program and the SBA 504 loan program in conjunction with junior lien financing from a Certified Development Company CDC ). The SBA has designated the Bank as a Preferred Lender. As an SBA Preferred Lender, the Bank has been delegated loan approval, closing and most servicing and liquidation authority from the SBA. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of loans that the Company sold in the secondary market yet retained the servicing of such loans was million and million, respectively.

Construction and land development loans are evaluated based on the borrower s and guarantor s credit worthiness, past experience in the industry, track record and experience with the type of project being considered, and other factors. Collateral value is determined generally by independent appraisal utilizing multiple approaches to determine value based on property type. 

The Bank engages in third-party factoring of certain business s accounts receivable invoices. The Bank s factoring clients are primarily in the transportation industry. Each account debtor is credit qualified, confirming credit worthiness and stability, because the underlying debtor represents the substantive underlying credit risk. Some factored receivables are full recourse to and personally guaranteed by the factoring client. In such cases, the client is credit qualified under specific policy guidelines. Concentration limits are set and monitored for aggregate factored receivables, account debtors, and individual factoring clients. In addition, we consider the overall state of each specific industry, currently over-the-road trucking, in our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the factoring client and the underlying debtor. 

For all loan types, the Company establishes guidelines for its underwriting criteria including collateral coverage ratios, global debt service coverage ratios, and maximum amortization or loan maturity terms. 

At the portfolio level, the Company monitors concentrations of loans based on several criteria including loan type, collateral type, industry, geography, and other factors. The Company also performs periodic market research and economic analysis at a local geographic and national level. Based on this research, the Company may from time to time change the minimum or benchmark underwriting criteria applied to the above loan types. 

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of the Company s management, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower.

Under ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible. The Company s allowance for credit losses for loans consists of two components: (1) a specific valuation allowance based on probable losses on specifically identified loans and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical credit loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. 

The Company uses the open pool life method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company s loan pools. The loan portfolio pools were selected in order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, except for the dental, SBA and USDA loans, are segregated in separate pools. 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective evaluation. In setting the specific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans, which along with the delinquency list of loans, helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company allocates a specific reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the loan or when the discounted cash flows for the loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management s assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. We reevaluate the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on a quarterly basis. 

In determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical lifetime credit loss experience, concentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company s loan portfolio, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the Company s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company and other relevant factors in accordance with ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. Historical lifetime credit loss experience is determined by utilizing an open-pool cumulative loss rate methodology. Adjustments to the historical lifetime credit loss experience are made for differences in current loan pool risk characteristics such as portfolio concentrations, delinquency, non-accrual, and watch list levels, as well as changes in current and forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates, property and collateral values, and other indices relating to economic activity. The utilization of reasonable and supportable forecasts includes an immediate reversion to lifetime historical loss rates. For all loan pools, management has determined two years represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate over two years on a straight-line basis. Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories. 

Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics. 

Collateral dependent loans are secured by real estate assets, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. For a collateral dependent loan, the Company s evaluation process includes a valuation by appraisal or other collateral analysis adjusted for selling costs, when appropriate. This valuation is compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan. If a loss is determined to be probable, the loss is included in the allowance for credit losses on loans as a specific allocation.

Allowance For Credit Losses Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures . The allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed in the table above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur, and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management s best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 4 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded.

General 

We are a Texas corporation and registered financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. We provide a wide array of financial products and services including banking, trust, investment advisory, securities brokerage, third party administration, qualified plan recordkeeping and insurance services to individuals, small businesses and institutions across the United States. 

The following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes related thereto in this Form 10-Q and in the audited financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We operate through four main direct and indirect subsidiaries: (i) T Bancshares, Inc. TBI ), which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas on December 23, 2002 to serve as the registered bank holding company for T Bank, N.A. a national banking association (the Bank ), (ii) Sanders Morris LLC Sanders Morris ), a registered broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), and registered investment advisor with the SEC, (iii) Tectonic Advisors, LLC Tectonic Advisors ), a registered investment advisor registered with the SEC focused generally on managing money for relatively large, affiliated institutions, and (iv) HWG Insurance Agency LLC HWG ), an insurance agency registered with the Texas Department of Insurance TDI ). 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepare consolidated financial statements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP and to customary practices within the financial services industry. These policies, in certain areas, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on the financial statements. 

As discussed in Note 1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, effective on January 1, 2023, pursuant to the delayed adoption allowable for smaller reporting companies, and replaces allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables , and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K. Upon adoption of the current expected credit loss CECL methodology, the Company recorded an increase of 1.4 million to the allowance for credit losses for loans and 237,505 to the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments. In addition, the Company recognized a cumulative effect reduction to retained earnings totaling 1.3 million, net of a recorded deferred tax asset of 341,662. See the discussion in Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements for more details on the impact of the Company s adoption of the CECL methodology, including related accounting policies. 

Performance Summary 

Net income available to common shareholders increased 416,000, or 11.0 , to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share were 0.58 and 0.52 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net income available to common shareholders decreased 1.1 million, or 10.4 , to 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share were 1.33 and 1.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of a 1.8 million increase in net interest income and a 1.1 million increase in non-interest income, partly offset by a 644,000 increase in the provision for credit losses, a 1.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a 204,000 decrease in income tax expense. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of a 2.5 million increase in the provision for credit losses and a 4.2 million increase in non-interest expense, partly offset by a 2.9 million increase in net interest income, a 2.2 million increase in non-interest income and a 627,000 decrease in income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, annual return on average assets was 2.29 , compared to 2.62 for the same period in the prior year, and annual return on average equity was 16.89 , compared to 16.22 for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, annual return on average assets was 1.87 , compared to 2.49 for the same period in the prior year, and annual return on average equity was 13.41 , compared to 15.93 for the same period in the prior year. 

Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, this Form 10-Q contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP, which includes return on average tangible common equity. We calculate return on average tangible common equity as net income available to common shareholders (net income less dividends paid on preferred stock) divided by average tangible common equity. We calculate average tangible common equity as average shareholders equity less average goodwill, average core deposit intangible and average preferred stock. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity is average total shareholders equity. We believe these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP measures and ratios in assessing our operating results and related trends, and when planning and forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, measures and ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

The following table presents non-GAAP reconciliations of annual return on average tangible common equity as of and for the periods indicated:

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing cash, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and spread, and are reflected in net interest margin, as well as changes in average interest rates. Volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

37

Table of Contents 

The following tables present the changes in net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each.

Net interest income increased 1.8 million, or 27.5 , from 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in the average volume of and yield on loans and an increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve). The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average volume and cost of time deposits. Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.25 and 4.43 , respectively, a decrease of 18 basis points. 

The average volume of interest-earning assets increased 195.9 million, or 33.3 , from 578.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 784.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a 148.4 million, or 30.0 , increase in the average volume of loans, a 46.9 million, or 108.4 , increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold and a 616,000, or 1.2 , increase in securities. 

The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 64 basis points from 7.88 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.52 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the increasing market interest rate environment over the respective periods. The average yield for loans increased 79 basis points from 8.50 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits and fed funds sold increased just 1 basis point from 5.41 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the average yield on securities increased 31 basis points from 3.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included a 178.6 million, or 42.4 , increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits and a 20.0 million, or 1,793.6 , increase in the average volume of FHLB and other borrowings. The increase in borrowings is related to a 20.0 million advance from FRB for the BTFP. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 60 basis points from 4.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The average cost of FHLB and other borrowings decreased 78 basis points from 5.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the average cost of the subordinated debt increased 9 basis points from 10.68 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.77 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Net interest income increased 2.9 million or 14.1 , from 20.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in the average volume and yield on loans and to a lesser extent an increase in the average volume and the average interest yield of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve). The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average volume and cost of time deposits and money market deposits and an increase in the average volume of borrowings. Net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.20 and 4.58 , respectively, a decrease of 38 basis points. 

The average volume of interest-earning assets increased 143.8 million, or 24.1 , from 597.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 740.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included an 105.4 million, or 21.8 , increase in the average volume of loans, a 36.9 million, or 59.5 , increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold and a 1.5 million, or 2.9 , increase in securities.

Table of Contents 

The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 84 basis points from 7.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the increasing market interest rate environment over the respective periods. The average yield for loans increased 100 basis points from 8.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Provision for Credit Losses 

As discussed in Note 1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, 2023. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as off-balance sheet credit exposures. Provision for credit losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses for various types of financial instruments to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. Management actively monitors the Company s asset quality and provides appropriate provisions based on such factors as historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

Financial instruments are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, forecasted economic conditions continue to remain uncertain due to the continued elevated interest rate environment and persistent inflationary pressures in the United States and our market areas. Accordingly, future provisions to the allowance for credit losses may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the determination.

Provision expense for loans is generally reflective of change in loan volume and mix as well as charge-offs or specific reserves taken during the respective period. Provision expense is also impacted by the economic outlook and changes in macroeconomic variables. The provision expense recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by increased loan volume and required specific reserves. See Allowance for Credit Losses, below, for further analysis of our provision for credit losses related to loans. 

Changes in the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures are generally driven by the remaining unfunded loan commitments expected to fund loans and to changes in the assumptions to project loss rates.

Total non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.1 million, or 10.4 , and 2.2 million, or 7.1 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Material changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed below. 

Trust Income. Trust income is earned for trust services on the value of managed and non-managed assets held in custody. Volatility in the bond and equity markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related fees. Trust income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 237,000, or 14.2 and 719,000, or 15.1 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in trust income between the periods is due to an increase in the value of trust assets over the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Volatility related to overall economic expectations, impacts of geo-political instability related to the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, the potential for continued or increasing supply-chain disruptions, and regulatory action, including elevated market interest rates aimed at tempering the inflationary pressures in the United States, and expectations around further decreases in rates by the Federal Reserve from recent highs, all of which are likely to impact the bond and equity markets, or other factors, could result in future net decreases in the average values of our assets held in custody, and/or in a decrease in net flows to our assets held in custody, decreasing our trust income. 

Gain on sale of loans. The gain on sale of loans primarily reflects the gain from the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) and USDA loans originated by the Bank s SBA lending group. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, gain on sale of loans increased 234,000, or 100 , and decreased 347,000, or 59.7 , respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year.

Table of Contents 

Advisory income . Advisory fees are typically based on a percentage of the underlying average asset values for a given period, where each percentage point represents 100 basis points. These revenues are of a recurring nature but are directly affected by increases and decreases in the values of the underlying assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, advisory income increased 718,000, or 19.7 and 1.6 million, or 15.0 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in advisory income between the two periods is due to increases in advisory assets between the two periods from market appreciation of our advisory assets, and to a lesser extent, net inflows. Similar to our trust income, changes in the value of our assets under management will result in comparable changes in our advisory income. In addition to volatility related to general economic expectations, including the recent 0.5 reduction in the benchmark interest rate by the Federal Reserve from recent highs, given signs of stabilizing inflation, expectations of further rate reductions, the potential for renewed inflationary pressures, as well as supply chain disruptions related to geo-political instability, including the ongoing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, are likely to continue to put pressure on the financial markets and the value of and/or net inflows to our assets under management, potentially decreasing our advisory income. 

Brokerage income. Brokerage revenues are generally based on a per share fee or commission to trade a share of a particular stock, bond or other security. In addition, brokerage revenues, in this context, include private placements, participation in syndication of public offerings, and certain other revenues, including interest earned on margin lending. Brokerage revenue is dependent on the volume of trading, and on private placement and syndication activity during the period, and in the case of margin lending, on asset volumes and interest rates. Brokerage income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 216,000, or 10.9 and 85,000, or 1.5 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The majority of the decrease was related primarily to a decrease of 104,000 and 563,000 in margin participation interest during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year, combined with a decrease of 454,000 and 393,000, respectively, in syndicate and private placement income, and a decrease in insurance commissions of 5,000 and 63,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the same periods in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by increases in over-the-counter commissions of 324,000 and 903,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to increases in general brokerage activity and trading volumes, and other immaterial increases of 23,000 and 31,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Economic disruption related to regulatory action by the Federal Reserve with respect to interest rates, including further reductions in rates, or the expectation thereof, and to geo-political factors, among other factors, could lead to renewed stagnation in offering activity given price uncertainty in the face of volatile markets and the potential for interest rates to remain somewhat elevated in the mid-term, which amount to additional risks for companies considering offering activity. 

The table below reflects a rollforward of our client assets from December 31, 2022 through September 30, 2024, which includes both advisory and brokerage assets, and the inflows and outflows and net market appreciation from December 31, 2022 through September 30, 2024. Our brokerage and advisory assets experienced an increase of approximately 1.6 billion, or 26.2 , between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, related to market appreciation, and to a lesser extent, net inflows.

Service fees and other income. Service fees include fees for deposit-related services, loan servicing, third-party administration fees, and other income. Service fees and other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 80,000, or 2.9 , and 204,000, or 2.5 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily the result of increases in pension administration fees of 80,000 and 449,000, related to increases in the amount of work billed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, service fees, including loan servicing fees, increased 14,000 and 33,000, respectively, and margin interest income on Sanders Morris Pershing accounts increased 9,000 and 44,000, respectively. Offsetting these increases, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income decreased 14,000 and 285,000, respectively, with the large decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the recovery of unclaimed funds at Sanders Morris of 264,000 during the first quarter of 2023. In addition, consulting fees at Sanders Morris decreased 16,000 and 43,000, respectively. Other immaterial fluctuations netted to increases of 7,000 and 6,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Rental income. The Company receives monthly rental income from tenants leasing space in the Bank building. Rental income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2,000, or 2.2 and increased 49,000, or 22.5 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase was related to concessions given to tenants during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Total non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.8 million, or 16.2 and 4.2 million, or 12.0 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense, trust expense, brokerage expense, data processing expense, and other expense, which were partially offset by decreases professional fees expense. Material changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed below. 

Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.3 million, or 16.9 , and 3.3 million, or 14.3 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily due to increases in salaries and related payroll expenses in our Banking segment of 1.0 million and 2.6 million, respectively, due to increases in staff headcount and related signing bonuses, and annual merit increases. The increases at the Bank s Integra division totaled 191,000 and 529,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and the remaining increases of 1.1 million and 2.1 million, respectively, were primarily in the Bank s SBA division. Salaries and employee benefits in the Other Financial Services segment increased 376,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 139,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which decrease was largely due to the technology and accounting teams move from Tectonic Advisors to HoldCo effective July 1, 2023, offset by merit increases and an increase in headcount. Within the Other Financial Services segment, salaries and employee benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 at Tectonic Advisors increased 137,000 and decreased 675,000, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to merit increases and an increase in headcount, and the decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is due to the move of the technology and accounting teams to HoldCo, partially offset by merit increases and an increase in headcount. Salaries and employee benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 at the Bank s trust department increased 35,000 and 184,000, respectively, and at the Bank s Nolan division increased 43,000 and 286,000, respectively, due to an increase in headcount on the Bank s participant directed plan servicing team, staffing changes, and merit and cost of living increases, as well as increases in benefit premiums. The increase at Sanders Morris for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 161,000 and 66,000, respectively, was due to merit increases, and increases in commissions earned on brokerage activity related to general over the counter trading between the two periods, which was offset by decreases in commission expense on syndicate and private placement deals, which fell between the two periods. Salaries and employee benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 at HoldCo decreased 105,000 and increased 863,000, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a decrease in compensation related to stock grants, and the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to the move of the technology and accounting teams to HoldCo effective July 1, 2023.

Occupancy and equipment expense . Occupancy and equipment expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4,000, or 0.8 and 76,000, or 5.3 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were related to increases totaling 41,000 and 34,000, respectively, at the Other Financial Services segment, primarily related to increases in rent at Sanders Morris at both the Houston and Dallas offices. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in the HoldCo segment by 12,000 and 80,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases in rent at the Houston office and the move of the technology team from Tectonic Advisors to the HoldCo segment in July 2023. These increases were offset by decreases in our Banking segment of 49,000 and 38,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which were due to a major plumbing renovation in July 2023, partially offset by the re-paving of the parking area at the Bank during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Trust expenses . Trust expenses are incurred in our other financial services segment, and include model advisory fees paid on the common trust funds managed by the Company based on the value of the assets held in custody.

Professional fees, which include legal, consulting, audit and tax fees, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 111,000, or 30.2 and decreased 48,000, or 3.4 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. In our Other Financial Services segment, professional fees increased 36,000 and 44,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in professional fees of 38,000 and 80,000, respectively, related to technology work on our investment services portal. Audit and tax consulting fees increased 9,000 and decreased 6,000, for the three and nine months, respectively, and legal fees decreased 11,000 and 30,000, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The HoldCo segment had an increase of 84,000 and a decrease of 3,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fluctuations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily due to an increase in audit and tax consulting of 86,000 and 137,000, respectively, related to an adjustment made during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in a credit balance in audit fees during that period, and differences in timing of recognition compared to the prior year, and increases of 51,000 and 55,000 in legal fees, respectively, related to review and research around our equity structure, offset by decreases in professional fees of 53,000 and 195,000, respectively, related to technology platform work in 2023 using robotic process automation, which carries a higher cost compared to other technology work, but led to significant and ongoing time savings for our Trust team. The decreases in the Banking segment of 9,000 and 89,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily due to decreases of 6,000 and 19,000, respectively, in audit and tax consulting fees, and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in legal fees of 74,000, primarily related to loan collections activity in 2023 and various other matters which increased legal expense in the earlier period, offset by an increase in professional fees of 4,000. In addition to the decrease of 6,000 in audit and tax consulting for the three months ended September 30, 2024, professional fees decreased 5,000. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal fees of 2,000, due to immaterial fluctuations in these costs. 

Data processing . Data processing includes costs related to the Company s core operating system. Data processing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 59,000, or 24.5 and 224,000, or 34.6 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were the result of increases of 38,000 and 182,000, respectively, in our Banking segment and increases of 21,000 and 42,000, respectively, in the Trust and Nolan divisions within our Other Financial Services segment. The increases overall resulted from discounts provided by the Bank s core system vendor related to the change in the core system during 2021, which discounts were exhausted in the first quarter of 2023, and normal increases in these costs.

The increases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the HoldCo segment of 64,000 were primarily related to the movement of technology and accounting staff to HoldCo effective July 1, 2024, and included increases of 46,000 in software licenses related to technology initiatives across the company, increases of 28,000 in travel and lodging, increases of 18,000 in computer services, and an increase of 14,000 in postage, offset by decreases of 50,000 in advertising and marketing expense related to narrowing the focus of marketing efforts, decreases of 23,000 in insurance expense, netted with other individually immaterial increases of 31,000, compared to the same period in the prior year.

Net interest income plus non-interest income 

Banking 

Income before taxes increased 149,000, or 5.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 2.9 million, or 30.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a 1.8 million increase net interest income and a 243,000 increase in non-interest income, partly offset by a 644,000 increase in the provision for credit losses and a 1.3 million increase in non-interest expense. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a 2.5 million increase in the provision for credit losses, a 3.1 million increase in non-interest expense and a 266,000 decrease in non-interest income, partly offset by a 3.0 million increase net interest income. 

Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.8 million, or 26.3 , and 3.0 million, or 14.0 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to increases in the average volume of and yield on loans and an increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve). The impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average interest volume of and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The average yield on interest earning assets was impacted by changes in market interest rates and changes in the mix of interest-earning assets. See Net Interest Income, above, for further analysis of net interest income. 

The provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 606,000 and 3.2 million, respectively, compared to a 38,000 credit provision and 732,000, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of increased loan volume and required specific reserves. See Provision for Credit Losses, above, and Allowance for Credit Losses, below, for further analysis of credit loss provision related to loans and off-balance sheet commitments. 

Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 243,000, or 60.3 , compared to the same period in the prior year which was primarily due to a 234,000 increase in gain on sale of loans and a 11,000 increase in factoring fees. Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 266,000, or 16.0 , compared to the same period in the prior year which due to a 347,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans, partly offset by a 32,000 increase in deposit and factoring fees and a 49,000 increase in rental income related to concessions given to tenants during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See the analysis of non-interest income included in the section captioned Non-Interest Income included elsewhere in this discussion. 

Non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.3 million, or 28.3 and 3.1 million, or 24.4 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively. Salaries and employee benefits increased 1.0 million and 2.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively, primarily due to increases in staff with the expansion of our SBA lending and Integra factoring along with increases in annual merit and market increases. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased 49,000 and 38,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively, primarily due to decrease in facilities repairs and maintenance expense. Professional fees decreased 9,000 and 89,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior years, respectively, primarily due to lower audit fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and higher legal fees expensed for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to loan collections and various other matters, along with lower audit fees recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Data processing expense increased 38,000 and 182,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior years, respectively, as a result of a reduction of discounts provided by the Bank s core system vendor related to the change in the core system during 2021, along with normal annual increase in data processing costs. Other expenses increased 264,000 and 493,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior years, respectively, which included increases of 77,000 and 214,000 for advertising and marketing costs primarily in our Integra division, 145,000 and 276,000 for software development in our lending and Integra divisions, 33,000 and 47,000 for FDIC assessment, and decreases of 14,000 and 152,000 in employee recruitment fees, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively, among other things.

Income before taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 222,000, or 5.7 , and 2.4 million, or 26.0 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were the result of increases in noninterest income of 808,000 and 2.4 million, respectively, and increases in noninterest expense of 586,000 and 21,000, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 808,000, or 8.3 , and 2.4 million, or 8.5 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were due to increases in advisory income of 718,000 and 1.6 million, respectively, and increases in trust income of 237,000 and 719,000, respectively, both of which were related to market increases in asset values and net asset inflows to our investment platform, in addition to an increase in performance based fees at Sanders Morris, which accounted for 123,000 and 199,000, respectively, of the increase in advisory. Service fees and other income increased by 69,000 and 172,000, respectively, between the two periods, primarily related to increases in third party pension administration fees from the Bank s Nolan division of 80,000 and 449,000, respectively, which were partially offset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by a decrease in miscellaneous income related to a recovery of unclaimed funds at Sanders Morris of 264,000 during the first quarter 2023. These increases were offset by decreases in brokerage income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 216,000 and 85,000, respectively, with the majority of the decrease relating primarily to decreases of 454,000 and 393,000, respectively, in commission income from syndicated offerings and private placements. In addition, income from margin lending for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 104,000 and 563,000, respectively related to the decreased appetite for margin lending given persistently high interest rates, and a modest decrease in insurance commissions of 5,000 and 63,000, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in fees and commissions from general over the counter trading during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 324,000 and 903,000, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year. See Non-Interest Income, above for further analysis of non-interest income. 

Non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 586,000, or 10.1 , and 21,000, or 0.1 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase of 586,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 376,000, and in other operating costs of 68,000. The majority of the increase in salaries and employee benefits was at Sanders Morris of 161,000, primarily from an increase in performance based advisory fees, which have a high payout rate relative to revenue earned, as well as differences in bonus expense at Tectonic Advisors between the two periods of 100,000 primarily due to an adjustment during the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the move of the technology and accounting teams to the HoldCo segment, which was done in an effort to better allocate costs across the Company. The increase of 68,000 in other operating costs related primarily to an increase in FDIC insurance and other regulatory costs at the Bank totaling 43,000 and software and software licenses for the Bank s Trust department and the Nolan division totaling 38,000. Other categories of non-interest expenses increased 142,000 in total, consisting of increases in occupancy and equipment expense of 41,000, professional fees of 36,000, brokerage and advisory direct costs of 23,000, and trust expense and data processing expense, which each increased by 21,000. The increase in non-interest expense of 21,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related primarily to increases in trust expense of 148,000, brokerage and advisory direct costs of 117,000, professional fees of 44,000, data processing costs of 42,000, and occupancy and equipment costs of 34,000. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other operating costs of 225,000 and in salaries and employee benefits of 139,000. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to a decrease of 675,000 at Tectonic Advisors from the transition of accounting and technology personnel to Tectonic Financial within the HoldCo segment, which was partially offset by increases at the Bank s Nolan and Trust divisions of 287,000 and 184,000, respectively, related to increases in salary expense from an increase in headcount in the participant directed plan team within the Trust department and to merit increases and an increase in benefits expense, and to an increase in salaries and benefits at Sanders Morris of 66,000 related to increases in commissions primarily from performance based fee arrangements, which, as mentioned above, have a high commission payout relative to revenue, and to an increase in bonus earnouts from increases in over the counter trading commissions and fees. The decrease in other operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to decreases in marketing expense of 276,000, primarily related to the change in our fee sharing agreement with Cain Watters, and decreases in computer services and supplies and software expense totaling 52,000, and a decrease in recruitment fees of 13,000, and other individually immaterial decreases of 32,000. These were offset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by an increase related to trading errors at Tectonic Advisors totaling 134,000. See Non-Interest Expense, above, for further analysis of non-interest.

HoldCo 

The loss before taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5,000, or 0.3 , and 1.1 million, or 32.3 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2,000 and 99,000, respectively, solely due to increases in interest rates on our subordinated debt. Non-interest expense increased 3,000 and 1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of 105,000, which was partially offset by an increase in professional fees of 84,000, and to increases in occupancy and equipment and other operating expense of 12,000 and 11,000, respectively. The reduction in salaries and benefits expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is related to certain signing bonus expenses reaching full amortization between the two periods, and to an adjustment during the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the transition of accounting and technology personnel to Tectonic Financial, which is within the Company s HoldCo segment, from Tectonic Advisors, which activity is within the Company s Other Financial Services segment, to better reflect the function of those personnel given they serve departments across the Company. The increase in non-interest expense of 1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of 863,000 related to the transition of personnel to Tectonic Financial, as well as to an increase in headcount. In addition, occupancy and equipment expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year increased 80,000 related primarily to increases in rent, common area maintenance and parking totaling 58,000 related to the transition of personnel and from increases in headcount on our technology team, which offices in our Houston office, as well as the buildout of the technology team s space in Houston, which increased depreciation expense and repairs and maintenance expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other operating expense increased 64,000 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, related to increases in software and software license expense and in postage expense related to marketing campaigns during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in professional fees of 3,000. See Non-Interest Income, above, and Non-Interest Expense, above, for further analyses of non-interest income and non-interest expense included in the respectively titled sections above. 

Financial Condition 

Investment Securities 

The primary purpose of the Company s investment portfolio is to provide a source of earnings for liquidity management purposes, to provide collateral to pledge against borrowings, and to control interest rate risk. In managing the portfolio, the Company seeks to attain the objectives of safety of principal, liquidity, diversification, and maximized return on investment. 

As of September 30, 2024, securities available for sale consisted of U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Securities held to maturity consist of Property Assessed Clean Energy PACE and PID/TIRZ investments. These investment contracts or bonds located in Texas, California and Florida, originate under a contractual obligation between the property owners, the local county or city administration, and a third-party administrator and sponsor. PACE assessments are created to fund the purchase and installation of energy saving improvements to the property such as solar panels. PID/TIRZ assessments are used to pay for the development costs of a residential subdivision. Generally, as a property assessment, the total assessment is repaid in installments over a period of 5 to 32 years by the then current property owner(s). Each installment is collected by the County or City Tax Collector where the property is located. The assessments are an obligation of the property.

The Company evaluates all available for sale securities in unrealized loss positions to determine if any securities resulted from credit factors or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors for each security type in the portfolio. The issuers of these securities are U.S. government agencies and continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. Due to the low risk in these U.S. government guaranteed securities, no allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities was recognized as of September 30, 2024. 

The following table summarizes the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted-average yields of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity as of September 30, 2024. Yields are calculated based on amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Other securities classified as securities, restricted include stock in the FRB and the FHLB, which have no maturity date.

Non-performing Assets 

Our primary business segments are Banking and Other Financial Services, and, as outlined above, the Banking segment s primary business is lending. That activity entails potential loan losses, the magnitude of which depends on a variety of economic factors affecting borrowers and factor clients which are beyond our control. While we have instituted underwriting guidelines and policies and credit review procedures to protect us from avoidable credit losses, some losses will inevitably occur. 

Loans are considered past due when principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments are contractually due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the loan interest and generally when such loans are 90 days or more past due. 

Foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations. Write-downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. 

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, accruing loans and factored receivables greater than 90 days past due, and foreclosed assets. The following table sets forth certain information regarding non-performing loans by type, including ratios of such loans to total assets as of the dates indicated:

Allowance for Credit Losses 

As discussed in Note 1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, our policies and procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on January 1, 2023 in connection with the adoption of the CECL methodology as codified in ASC 326. In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. When management deems all or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is charged-off against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management s best estimate of CECL on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

The Company uses the open pool life method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company s loan pools. The loan portfolio pools were selected in order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, except for the dental, SBA and USDA loans, are segregated in separate pools. For dental and SBA 7(a) loans, the Company adjusts the pool life for expected prepayment speeds. 

For all loan pools, management has determined two years represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate over two years on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss driver forecasts over the two year forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when developing the forecast metrics. 

Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics. See the discussion of Q-Factors, below. 

The allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the open pool method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. 

Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. 

Management qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors Q-Factor that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factors and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease management s estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies; (ii) staff experience; (iii) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (iv) concentration risk; (v) trends in underlying collateral values; (vi) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; and (vii) economic conditions. 

Upon the adoption of ASC 326 effective on January 1, 2023, the total amount of the allowance for credit losses for loans estimated using the CECL methodology increased 1.4 million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses for loans estimated as of December 31, 2022 using the prior incurred loss model under GAAP.

Sources of Funds 

General 

Deposits, loan and investment security repayments and prepayments, proceeds from the sale of securities, and cash flows generated from operations are the primary sources of our funds for lending, investing, and other general purposes. Loan repayments are generally a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows tend to fluctuate with prevailing interest rates, markets and economic conditions, and competition.

Deposits 

Deposits are attracted principally from our primary geographic market area with the exception of time deposits, which, due to the Company s attractive rates, are attracted from across the nation. The Company offers a broad selection of deposit products, including demand deposit accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, term certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans (such as IRAs). Deposit account terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, and the associated interest rates. Management sets the deposit interest rates periodically based on a review of deposit flows and a survey of rates among competitors and other financial institutions. The Company relies on customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits, and also on CD listing services. As of September 30, 2024, deposits includes a 50.0 million brokered deposit through an Insured Cash Sweep One-Way Buy agreement. 

Total deposits increased 159.2 million, or 30.2 , to 686.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 526.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The following table sets forth our average deposit account balances, the percentage of each type of deposit to total deposits, and average cost of funds for each category of deposits for the periods indicated:

The Company also has a credit line with the FRB with borrowing capacity of 40.4 million, secured by commercial loans. The Company had no borrowings under this line from the FRB as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

As part of the BTFP, the FRB offered loans of up to one year in length to banks and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral, which are assessed at par value. The Bank pledged AFS securities with par value of 20.0 million to provide additional liquidity to meet the needs of depositors as of September 30, 2024. The Company had 20.0 million and 21.0 million of borrowings related to the BTFP as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

As of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had outstanding subordinated notes totaling 12.0 million, consisting of 8.0 million of subordinated notes issued in 2017 bearing an interest rate of three month CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161 plus 5.125 , with interest payable quarterly and maturing on July 20, 2027, at which all principal is due, and a 4.0 million subordinated note issued in 2018 bearing a fixed interest rate of three-month CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161 plus 4.348 , payable quarterly, and maturing on March 31, 2028. The subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to the payment of our existing and future senior indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. 

Capital Resources and Regulatory Capital Requirements 

Shareholders equity increased 5.9 million, or 5.5 , to 112.8 million as of September 30, 2024, from 106.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase included net income of 10.9 million, 63,000 related to stock compensation expenses and 572,000 net after-tax increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increases were partly offset by the repurchase of stock options and common stock in the net amounts of 1.3 million and 863,000, respectively, and dividends paid on the Series B preferred stock and paid on the common stock in the amounts of 1.3 million and 2.1 million, respectively. 

Together with the Bank, the Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s and, accordingly, the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company met the definition of well-capitalized under the applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve and the Bank s regulatory capital ratios were in excess of the capital conservation buffer and the levels established for well-capitalized institutions under the FDIC s regulatory framework for prompt corrective action and the Basel III capital guidelines. 

Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined in the regulations).

In addition to the regulatory requirements of the federal banking agencies, Sanders Morris and Tectonic Advisors are subject to the regulatory framework applicable to registered investment advisors under the SEC s Division of Investment Management. 

Sanders Morris is regulated by FINRA, which, among other requirements, imposes minimums on its net regulatory capital. As of September 30, 2024, Sanders Morris is in compliance with its net regulatory capital requirement. 

Liquidity 

Our liquidity relates to our ability to maintain a steady flow of funds to support our ongoing operating, investing and financing activities. Our board of directors establishes policies and analyzes and manages liquidity to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet normal operating requirements in addition to unexpected customer demands for funds, such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and cost-effective manner. The most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply of core deposits and funds. Ultimately, public confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position. Liquidity management is viewed from a long-term and a short-term perspective as well as from an asset and liability perspective. We monitor liquidity through a regular review of loan and deposit maturities and forecasts, incorporating this information into a detailed projected cash flow model. 

The Bank s liquidity is monitored by its management, the Asset-Liability Committee and its board of directors who review historical funding requirements, current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated future funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments. 

The Company s primary sources of funds are retail, small business, custodial, wholesale commercial deposits, loan repayments, maturity of investment securities, other short-term borrowings, and other funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows and loan prepayments are more influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions, and competition. The Company will maintain investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of (1) the need for funds, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on short-term liquid assets, and (4) objectives of the asset/liability management program. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 94.8 million held in an interest-bearing account at the FRB. The Company has the ability to borrow funds as members of the FHLB and the FRB. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s borrowing capacity with the FHLB was 60.2 million based upon loan collateral pledged to the FHLB, of which none was utilized as of September 30, 2024. 

The borrowing capacity on the discount line of credit with the FRB was 40.4 million, of which none was utilized as of September 30, 2024. During March 2023, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP, which was made available to banks in response to liquidity concerns in the United States banking system. The BTFP allows the whole par value of available for sale securities to be included as the collateral value. As of September 30, 2024, securities with a par value of 20.0 million were pledged to the Federal Reserve under this program, of which 20.0 million was borrowed against. In addition, the Company has approximately 210.5 million of SBA guaranteed loans held for investment that could be sold to investors. 

Management believes that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its obligations. However, if general economic conditions, potential recession in the United States and our market areas, the impacts related to or resulting from bank failures and any uncertainty in the banking industry, including the associated impact to the Company and other financial institutions of any regulatory changes or other mitigation efforts taken by government agencies in response thereto, increased competition for deposits and related changes in deposit customer behavior, changes in market interest rates, the resurgence of elevated levels of inflation or inflationary pressures in the United States and our market areas, or other events, cause these sources of external funding to become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds or may incur substantially higher funding costs or operating restrictions in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company s operations and growth. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of credit extended is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer and, if deemed necessary, may require collateral. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit of approximately 77.6 million and 162,000, respectively. 

Allowance For Credit Losses Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is calculated under the CECL model, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding commitments to extend credit and letters of credit detailed above. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur based on historical utilization rates. Upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, the impact of adoption was 238,000 to the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposure. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaled 513,000 and 192,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a credit loss expense related to off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaling 139,000 and 322,000, respectively. There was no allowance for credit loss expense recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the allowance for credit loss expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 10,000. Further information regarding our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 

As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability management policy provides management with guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring the net interest rate sensitivity position. 

Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 

We manage exposure to interest rates by structuring the balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We use no off-balance-sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. 

Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank s Asset Liability Committee in accordance with policies approved by the Bank s board of directors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. 

The committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. We employ methodologies to manage interest rate risk which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model. 

57

Table of Contents 

We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. 

On at least an annual basis, we run various stress tests to measure the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously, and ramped rates change over a twelve-month and twenty-four month horizon based upon parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Additionally, we run non-parallel simulation involving analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. 

The following table summarizes the impact of an instantaneous, sustained simulated change in net interest income over a 12-month horizon as of September 30 2024: 

Change in Interest Rates (basis points)

+200 

8.90 

+100 

4.44 

-100 

(4.17 

-200 

(7.82 

We have found that, historically, interest rates on deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis, meaning that process by which we measure the gap between interest rate sensitive assets verses interest rate sensitive liabilities. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies. 

Impact of Inflation 

Our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession. Inflation generally increases the costs of funds and operating overhead, and to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates, the yields on such assets. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation. In addition, inflation affects a financial institution s cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense and similar items. Inflation and related increases in market interest rates by the Federal Reserve generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings and shareholders equity.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, an evaluation was performed by the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
