Prior to December 1, 2021, the JV Company was accounted for under the provisions of the consolidation guidance since the Company had controlling financial interest. As of December 2, 2021, the Company ceased having control over the JV Company. Therefore, the Company deconsolidated the JV Company as of that date.

License and Development Revenue Recognition 
 
 In February 2023, the Company entered into a license agreement with a customer, pursuant to which the Company agreed to license its proprietary Silicon Carbide (SiC) technology to the customer and engineering and development services for 24 months for a total fee of million, consisting of an upfront fee and milestone payments of million, million and million paid to the Company in March 2023, July 2023 and February 2024, respectively, with the remaining amount to be paid upon the achievement of specified engineering services and product milestones.

 Equity method investment 
 The Company uses the equity method of accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Effective December 1, 2021, the Company reduced its equity interest in the JV Company and no longer controlled the JV Company. As a result, beginning December 2, 2021, the Company recorded its investment under the equity method of accounting. Since the Company is unable to obtain accurate financial information from the JV Company in a timely manner, the Company records its share of earnings or losses of such affiliate on a one quarter lag. The Company discloses and recognizes intervening events at the JV Company in the lag period that could materially affect its consolidated financial statements, if applicable. 
 The Company records its interest in the net earnings of the equity method investee, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within earnings or loss from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income (loss). Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with the equity method investee are eliminated until realized by the investor and investee. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment. The Company reviews for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (loss). 
 Valuation of inventories 
 
 The Company carries inventories at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost primarily consists of semiconductor wafers and raw materials, labor, depreciation expenses and other manufacturing expenses and overhead, and packaging and testing fees paid to third parties if subcontractors are used. Valuation of inventories is based on its periodic review of inventory quantities on hand as compared with its sales forecasts, historical usage, aging of inventories, production yield levels and current product selling prices. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those forecasted by the Company, additional future inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect its operating results. Adjustments to inventory, once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. If actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and the products that have previously been written down are sold, our gross margin would be favorably impacted.

 Market-based Restricted Stock Units MSUs 
 
 In December 2021, the Company granted million market-based restricted stock units MSUs to certain personnel. The number of shares to be earned at the end of performance period was determined based on the Company s achievement of specified stock prices and revenue thresholds during the performance period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024 as well as the recipients remaining in continuous service with the Company through such period. The MSUs vest in four equal annual installments after the end of performance period. The Company estimated the grant date fair values of its MSUs using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. In September 2023, the Company determined it was no longer probable that it would achieve the minimum revenue threshold specified in the awards. Therefore, the Company reversed all of the previously recognized expenses of million for these MSUs. In addition, on September 19, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved a modification of the terms of MSUs to extend the performance period through December 31, 2025, changed the commencement date for the four-year time-based service period to January 1, 2026, and reduced the achievement of specified stock prices and revenue thresholds. The fair value of these MSUs was revalued to reflect the change using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. In June 2024, the Company determined it was no longer probable that the revenue thresholds for the modified MSU would be achieved. Therefore, the Company reversed million in the June 2024 quarter that was recorded during the fiscal year 2024 related to the modification on September 19, 2023. On August 8, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved a modification of the terms of MSUs to extend the performance period through December 31, 2026, change the commencement date for the four-year time-based service period to January 1, 2027, and reduce the revenue thresholds. The fair value of these MSUs was revalued to reflect the change using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of , expected term of years, expected volatility of and dividend yield of . The Company recorded million of expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and a negative million of expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, the Company granted million MSUs to certain personnel. The number of shares to be earned at the end of performance period is determined based on the Company s achievement of specified stock prices and revenue thresholds during the performance period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 as well as the recipients remaining in continuous service with the Company through such period. The MSUs vest in four equal annual installments after the end of the performance period. The Company estimated the grant date fair values of its MSUs using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. On August 31, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved a modification of the terms of MSU to (i) extend the performance period through December 31, 2022 and (ii) change the commencement date for the four-year time-based service period to January 1, 2023. The fair value of these MSUs was recalculated to reflect the change as of August 31, 2020 and the unrecognized compensation amount was adjusted to reflect the increase in fair value. The Company recorded million and million of expenses for MSUs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The income tax expense of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included a million discrete tax expense. The income tax expense of million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a million discrete tax expense. Excluding the discrete income tax items, the income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively, and the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was ) and , respectively. The changes in the tax expense and effective tax rate between the periods resulted primarily from changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic jurisdictions between the current year and the same period of last year as well as from reporting pretax book loss of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to million of pretax book income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company files its income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The tax years 2004 to 2024 remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The tax years 2018 to 2024 remain open to examination by foreign tax authorities. 
 
 The Company s income tax returns are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. As of September 30, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately million, of which million, if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate in future periods. If the Company s estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, then a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to its uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months.

Altera Litigation 
 
 On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In the July 2015 ruling, the Tax Court concluded that the sharing of the cost of employee stock compensation in a company s cost-sharing arrangement was invalid under the U.S. Administrative Procedures Act. In June 2019, a panel of the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed this decision. In July 2019, Altera petitioned U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to hold an en banc rehearing of the case. The petition was subsequently denied by the Ninth Circuit. Altera appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2020, but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in June 2020, leaving intact the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit s decision. AOS has not recorded any benefit related to the Altera Corporation Tax Court decision in any period through September 30, 2024.

 Management s discussion should be read in conjunction with management s discussion included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 23, 2024. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a designer, developer and global supplier of a broad portfolio of power semiconductors. Our portfolio of power semiconductors includes approximately 2,700 products, and has grown significantly with the introduction of over 100 new products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and over 60 and 130 new products in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we introduced an 29 new products. Our teams of scientists and engineers have developed extensive intellectual property and technical knowledge that encompass major aspects of power semiconductors, which we believe enables us to introduce and develop innovative products to address the increasingly complex power requirements of advanced electronics. We have an extensive patent portfolio that consists of 935 patents and 53 patent applications in the United States as of September 30, 2024. We also have a total of 1,039 foreign patents, which were based primarily on our research and development efforts through September 30, 2024. We differentiate ourselves by integrating our expertise in technology, design and advanced manufacturing and packaging to optimize product performance and cost. Our portfolio of products targets high-volume applications, including personal computers, graphic cards, game consoles, flat panel TVs, home appliances, power tools, smart phones, battery packs, consumer and industrial motor controls and power supplies for TVs, computers, servers and telecommunications equipment. 
 
 Our business model leverages global resources, including research and development and manufacturing in the United States and Asia. Our sales and technical support teams are localized in several growing markets. We operate an 8-inch wafer fabrication facility located in Hillsboro, Oregon, or the Oregon Fab, which is critical for us to accelerate proprietary technology development, new product introduction and improve our financial performance. To meet the market demand for the more mature high volume products, we also utilize the wafer manufacturing capacity of selected third party foundries. For assembly and test, we primarily rely upon our in-house facilities in China. In addition, we utilize subcontracting partners for industry standard packages. We believe our in-house packaging and testing capability provides us with a competitive advantage in proprietary packaging technology, product quality, cost and sales cycle time. 
 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, we continued our product diversification program by developing new silicon and packaging platforms to expand our serviceable available market, or SAM and offer higher performance products. Our metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, or MOSFET, and power IC product portfolio also expanded. 
 
 On March 29, 2016, we formed a joint venture (the JV Company with two investment funds owned by the Municipality of Chongqing (the Chongqing Funds ), for the purpose of constructing and operating a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility Fab in the LiangJiang New Area of Chongqing, China. As of December 1, 2021, we owned 50.9 , and the Chongqing Funds owned 49.1 of the equity interest in the JV Company. The Joint Venture was accounted under the provisions of the consolidation guidance since we had controlling financial interests until December 1, 2021. 
 
 On December 1, 2021 (the Effective Date ), Alpha Omega Semiconductor (Shanghai) Ltd. AOS SH and Agape Package Manufacturing (Shanghai) Limited APM SH and, together with AOS SH, the Sellers ), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a share transfer agreement STA with a third-party investor to sell a portion of the Company's equity interest in the JV Company which consists of a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer 
 31 

fabrication facility in Chongqing, China (the Transaction ). The Transaction closed on December 2, 2021 (the Closing Date ), which reduced the Company s equity interest in the JV Company from 50.9 to 48.8 . Also, the Company s right to designate directors on the board of JV Company was reduced to three (3) out of seven (7) directors, from four (4) directors prior to the Transaction. As a result of the Transaction and other factors, the Company no longer had a controlling financial interest in the JV Company. The JV Company was deconsolidated from the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements effective as of the Closing Date. 
 
 On December 24, 2021, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement with another third-party investor, pursuant to which the Company sold to this investor 1.1 of outstanding equity interest held by the Company in the JV Company. In addition, the JV Company adopted an employee equity incentive plan and issued an equity interest equivalent to 3.99 of the JV Company in exchange for cash. As a result of these two transactions, the Company owned 45.8 of the equity interest in the JV Company as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 On January 26, 2022, the JV Company completed a financing transaction pursuant to a corporate investment agreement (the Investment Agreement between the JV Company and certain third-party investors (the New Investors ). Under the Investment Agreement, the New Investors purchased newly issued equity interest of the JV Company, representing approximately 7.82 of post-transaction outstanding equity interests of the JV Company, for a total purchase price of RMB 509 million (or approximately USD 80 million based on the currency exchange rate as of January 26, 2022) (the Investment ). Following the closing of the January 26, 2022 Investment, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was reduced to 42.2 at June 30, 2022. 
 
 In February 2024, the JV Company repurchased certain shares that were previously issued to employees under the employee equity incentive plan, which increased the Company s percentage of equity ownership in the JV Company by 0.54 . As of September 30, 2024, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was 42.8 . 
 
 We reduced our ownership of the JV Company to below 50 to increase the flexibility of the JV Company to raise capital to fund its future expansion. The JV Company is also contemplating an eventual listing on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR Market, of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The reduction of our ownership assists the JV Company in meeting certain regulatory listing requirements. A potential STAR Market listing may take several years to consummate and there is no guarantee that such listing by the JV Company will be successful or will be completed in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, the JV Company will continue to provide us with significant level of foundry capacity to enable us to develop and manufacture our products. On July 12, 2022, the current shareholders of the JV Company entered into a shareholders contract, pursuant to which the JV Company committed to provide us with a monthly wafer production capacity until December 2023, and additional commitment to provide wafer capacity after December 2023 if the JV Company s production capacity reaches certain specified level. 
 
 Other Factors affecting our Performance 
 
 The global, regional economic and PC market conditions : Because our products primarily serve consumer electronic applications, any significant changes in global and regional economic conditions could materially affect our revenue and results of operations. A significant amount of our revenue is derived from sales of products in the PC markets, such as notebooks, motherboards and notebook battery packs. Therefore, a substantial decline in the PC market could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. The PC markets have experienced a modest global decline in recent years due to continued growth of demand in tablets and smart phones, worldwide economic conditions and the industry inventory correction which had and may continue to have a material impact on the demand for our products. 
 
 A decline of the PC market may have a negative impact on our revenue, factory utilization, gross margin, our ability to resell excess inventory, and other performance measures. We have executed and continue to execute strategies to diversify our product portfolio, penetrate other market segments, including the consumer, communications and industrial markets, and improve gross margins and profit by implementing cost control measures. While making efforts to reduce our reliance on the computing market, we continue to support our computing business and capitalize on the opportunities in this market with a more focused and competitive PC product strategy to gain market share. 
 
 Manufacturing costs and capacity availability: Our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including our manufacturing costs, utilization of our manufacturing facilities, the product mixes of our sales, pricing of wafers from third party foundries and pricing of semiconductor raw materials. Capacity utilization affects our gross margin because we have certain fixed costs at our Shanghai facilities and our Oregon Fab. If we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities at a desired level, our gross margin may be adversely affected. In addition, from time to time, we may experience wafer capacity 
 constraints, particularly at third party foundries, that may prevent us from meeting fully the demand of our customers. While we can mitigate these constraints by increasing and re-allocating capacity at our own fab, we may not be able to do so quickly or at sufficient level, which could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. We also rely on the JV 
 32 

Company to provide foundry capacity to manufacture our products, therefore it is important that we maintain continuous access to such capacity, which may not be available at sufficient level or at pricing terms favorable to us because of lack of control over the JV Company s operation. We continue to maintain a business relationship with the JV Company to ensure uninterrupted supply of manufacturing capacity. Because we continue to rely on the JV Company to provide us with manufacturing capacity, if the JV Company take actions or make decisions that prevents us from accessing required capacity, our operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 Erosion and fluctuation of average selling price: Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical in our industry. Consistent with this historical trend, we expect our average selling prices of our existing products to decline in the future. However, in the normal course of business, we seek to offset the effect of declining average selling price by introducing new and higher value products, expanding existing products for new applications and new customers and reducing the manufacturing cost of existing products. These strategies may cause the average selling price of our products to fluctuate significantly from time to time, thereby affecting our financial performance and profitability. 
 
 Product introductions and customers product requirements: Our success depends on our ability to introduce products on a timely basis that meet or are compatible with our customers' specifications and performance requirements. Both factors, timeliness of product introductions and conformance to customers' requirements, are equally important in securing design wins with our customers. As we accelerate the development of new technology platforms, we expect to increase the pace at which we introduce new products and seek and acquire design wins. If we were to fail to introduce new products on a timely basis that meet customers specifications and performance requirements, particularly those products with major OEM customers, and continue to expand our serviceable markets, then we would lose market share and our financial performance would be adversely affected. 
 
 Distributor ordering patterns, customer demand and seasonality: Our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their forecasts of end customer demand, and this demand may vary significantly depending on the sales outlook and market and economic conditions of end customers. Because these forecasts may not be accurate, channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly, which in turn may prompt distributors to make significant adjustments to their purchase orders placed with us. As a result, our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, because our products are used in consumer electronics products, our revenue is subject to seasonality. Our sales seasonality is affected by numerous factors, including global and regional economic conditions as well as the PC market conditions, revenue generated from new products, changes in distributor ordering patterns in response to channel inventory adjustments and end customer demand for our products and fluctuations in consumer purchase patterns prior to major holiday seasons. In 
 recent periods, broad fluctuations in the semiconductor markets and the global and regional economic conditions, in particular the changing PC market conditions, have had a more significant impact on our results of operations than seasonality. Furthermore, our revenue may be impacted by the level of demand from our major customers due to factors outside of our control. If these major customers experience significant decline in the demand of their products, encounter difficulties or defects in their products, or otherwise fail to execute their sales and marketing strategies successfully, it may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.

Principal line items of condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) 
 The following describes the principal line items set forth in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (loss). 
 Revenue 
 
 We generate revenue primarily from the sale of power semiconductors, consisting of power discretes and power ICs. Historically, a majority of our revenue has been derived from power discrete products. Because our products typically have three-year to five-year life cycles, the rate of new product introduction is an important driver of revenue growth over time. We believe that expanding the breadth of our product portfolio is important to our business prospects, because it provides us with an opportunity to increase our total bill-of-materials within an electronic system and to address the power requirements of additional electronic systems. In addition, a small percentage of our total revenue is generated by providing packaging and testing services to third parties through one of our in-house facilities. 
 
 Our product revenue is reported net of the effect of the estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that we expect to provide to our distributors. Stock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of products purchased by the distributor during a specified period. At our discretion or upon our direct negotiations with the original design manufacturers ODMs or original equipment manufacturers OEMs ), we may elect to grant special pricing that is below the prices at which we sold our products to the distributors. In certain situations, we will grant price adjustments to the distributors reflecting such special pricing. We estimate the price adjustments for inventory at the distributors based on factors such as distributor inventory levels, forecasted distributor selling prices, distributor margins and demand for our products. 
 
 In February 2023, we entered into a license agreement with a customer to license our proprietary SiC technology and to provide 24-months of engineering and development services for a total fee of 45.0 million, consisting of an upfront fee and milestone payments of 18.0 million, 6.8 million and 9.0 million paid to us in the March 2023, July 2023 and February 2024, respectively, with the remaining amount to be paid upon the achievement of specified engineering services and product milestones. The license and development fee is determined to be one performance obligation and is recognized over the 24 months during which we perform the engineering and development services. We use the input method to measure progression of the transfer of services. During three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 5.6 million and 5.6 million of license and development revenue, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had recorded a total of 36.8 million of license and development revenue. When our performance under the contract precedes our receipt of consideration from the customer, and the receipt of consideration is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time, a contract asset is recorded. We also entered an accompanying supply agreement to provide limited wafer supply to the customer. 
 Cost of goods sold 
 
 Our cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs associated with semiconductor wafers, packaging and testing, personnel, including share-based compensation expense, overhead attributable to manufacturing, operations and procurement, and costs associated with yield improvements, capacity utilization, warranty and valuation of inventories. As the volume of sales increases, we expect cost of goods sold to increase. While our utilization rates cannot be immune to the market conditions, our goal is to make them less vulnerable to market fluctuations. We believe our market diversification strategy and product growth will drive higher volume of manufacturing which will improve our factory utilization rates and gross margin in the long run. 
 Operating expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate from period to period as we continue to exercise cost control measures in response to the declining PC market as well as align our operating expenses to the revenue level. 
 Research and development expenses . Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with new product prototypes, travel expenses, fees for engineering services provided by outside contractors and consultants, amortization of software and design tools, depreciation of equipment and overhead costs. We continue to invest in developing new technologies and products utilizing our own fabrication and packaging facilities as it is critical to our long-term success. We also evaluate appropriate investment levels and stay focused on new product introductions to improve our competitiveness. We expect that our research and development expenses will fluctuate from time to time. 
 34 

Selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation expense, product promotion costs, occupancy costs, travel expenses, expenses related to sales and marketing activities, amortization of software, depreciation of equipment, maintenance costs and other expenses for general and administrative functions as well as costs for outside professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to fluctuate in the near future as we continue to exercise cost control measures. 
 
 Income tax expense 
 
 We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. The Company s interim period tax provision for (benefit from) income taxes is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period. The Company s quarterly tax provision and estimate of its annual effective tax rate are subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting its pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in how the Company does business. 
 
 Significant judgment and estimates are required in determining our worldwide income tax expense. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations of different jurisdictions globally. We establish accruals for potential liabilities and contingencies based on a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of uncertain tax positions. If the recognition threshold is met, the applicable accounting guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. If the actual tax outcome of such exposures is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, the differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Changes in the location of taxable income (loss) could result in significant changes in our income tax expense. 
 
 We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on historical profitability and our estimate of future taxable income in a particular jurisdiction. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the deferred tax assets may increase or decrease, resulting in corresponding changes in income tax expense. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide profits or losses, the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region where we have operations, the availability of tax credits and carry-forwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. 
 
 The Chip and Science Act of 2022 , Enacted August 2, 2022 
 
 In August 2022 the U.S. enacted the Chip and Science Act of 2022 (the Chips Act). The Chips Act provides incentives to semiconductor chip manufacturers in the United States, including providing manufacturing investment credits of 25 for investments in semiconductor manufacturing property placed in service after December 31, 2022, for which construction begins before January 1, 2027. Property investments qualify for the 25 credit if, among other requirements, the property is integral to the operation of an advanced manufacturing facility, defined as having a primary purpose of manufacturing semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Currently, we are evaluating the impact of the Chips Act to us.. 
 
 The Inflation Reduction Act , Enacted August 16, 2022 
 In August 2022 the United States enacted tax legislation through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA introduces a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) for any consecutive three-tax-year period preceding the applicable tax year exceeds 1 billion. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after 31 December 2022. The CAMT is currently not applicable to the Company. 
 
 Bermuda Corporate Income Tax for Tax Years Beginning in 2025 
 
 The Company is subject to income tax expense or benefit based upon pre-tax income or loss reported in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the provisions of currently enacted tax laws. The parent company is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and is subject to Bermuda law with respect to taxation. Under current Bermuda law, the Company is not subject to any income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. As we have previously disclosed, the Government of Bermuda announced in December 2023 that it enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023, potentially imposing a 15 corporate income tax (CIT) on Bermuda companies that are within the scope of the CIT, that will be effective for tax years beginning on or after 
 35 

January 1, 2025. In particular, the CIT applies to multinational companies with annual revenue of 750 million euros or more in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity for at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year when the CIT may apply. 
 
 The Company is not in a position to determine whether the annual revenues may meet and/or cross the 750 million Euro threshold for at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year when CIT may apply. The Company continues to monitor and assess if and when it may be within the scope of the CIT. If we become subject to the Bermuda CIT, we may be subject to additional income taxes, which may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and our overall business. 
 
 Equity method investment income/loss from equity investee 
 
 We use the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but we do not have control, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, over the operating and financial policies of the company. Effective December 2, 2021, we reduced our equity interest in the JV Company below 50 of outstanding equity ownership and experienced a loss of control of the JV Company. As a result, we record our investment under equity method of accounting. Since we are unable to obtain accurate financial information from the JV Company in a timely manner, we record our share of earnings or losses of such affiliate on a one quarter lag. 
 
 We record our interest in the net earnings of the equity method investee, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within earnings or loss from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with the equity method investee are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the 
 investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment. Instead the total equity method investment balance, including equity method goodwill, is tested for impairment. We review for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Total revenue was 181.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.3 million, or 0.7 , as compared to 180.6 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 1.0 million and 0.2 million in sales of power discrete products and sales of power IC products, respectively. The increase in power discrete and power IC product sales was primarily due to a 15.8 increase in unit shipments, partially offset by a 13.1 decrease in average selling prices compared to same quarter last year due to a shift in product mix. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a significant increase in the computing markets, particularly in artificial intelligence and tablet products, as well as an increase in the communication markets, particular in battery, partially offset by a decrease in power supply and industrial markets, particularly in quick chargers. The revenue of packaging and testing services and other for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to same quarter last year, remained flat. The license and development services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was related to the license agreement signed in February 2023 with a customer to license our proprietary SiC technology and to provide 24-month engineering and development services.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage) Cost of goods sold 137,361 129,708 7,653 5.9 Percentage of revenue 75.5 71.8 Gross profit 44,526 50,925 (6,399) (12.6) Percentage of revenue 24.5 28.2 
 
 Cost of goods sold was 137.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.7 million or 5.9 , as compared to 129.7 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to 0.7 increase in revenue. Gross margin decreased by 3.7 percentage points to 24.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 28.2 for the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher material costs and less favorable product mix during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage) Research and development expenses 22,478 22,113 365 1.7 
 Research and development expenses were 22.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.4 million, or 1.7 , as compared to 22.1 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to a 1.9 million increase in share-based compensation expense as a result of a modification of market-based restricted stock units in August 2024, partially offset by a 0.9 million decrease in product prototyping engineering expense as a result of decreased engineering activities, as well as a 0.6 million decrease in employee compensation and benefit expense mainly due to decreased headcount and lower bonus expense. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage) Selling, general and administrative 22,300 19,431 2,869 14.8 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.9 million, or 14.8 , as compared to 19.4 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to a 3.3 million increase in share-based compensation expense as a result of a modification of market-based restricted stock units in August 2024, and 0.2 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expenses primarily due to increased headcount, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in audit fees, a 0.2 million decrease in legal fees and 0.1 million decrease in consulting fees.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage) Other income (loss), net (650) 26 (676) (2,600.0) 
 38 

Other income (loss), net decreased by 0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year primarily due to 0.1 million of an impairment of a privately-held investment, as well as an increase in foreign currency exchange loss as a result of the depreciation of RMB against USD. 
 Interest income, net 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage) Interest income, net 453 229 224 97.8 
 
 Interest income (expense), net increased by 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same quarter last year primarily due to lower interest expense as a result of less outstanding loan balance in current quarter. 
 Income tax expense 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage) Income tax expense 1,040 1,138 (98) (8.6) 
 
 The Company recognized income tax expense of approximately 1.0 million and 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax expense of 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included a 0.08 million discrete tax expense. The income tax expense of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a 0.05 million discrete tax expense. Excluding the discrete income tax items, the income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.0 million and 1.1 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (65.8) and 15.7 , respectively. The changes in the tax expense and effective tax rate between the periods resulted primarily from changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic jurisdictions between the current year and the same period of last year as well as from reporting pretax book loss of 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.9 million of pretax book income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company files its income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The tax years 2004 to 2024 remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The tax years 2018 to 2024 remain open to examination by foreign tax authorities. 
 
 The Company's income tax returns are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. As of September 30, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately 10.1 million, of which 6.9 million, if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate in future periods. If the Company's estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, then a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to its uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal need for liquidity and capital resources is to maintain sufficient working capital to support our operations and to invest adequate capital expenditures to grow our business. To date, we finance our operations and capital expenditures primarily through funds generated from operations and borrowings under our term loans, financing lease and other debt agreements.

 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months. In the long-term, we may require additional capital due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our cash is insufficient to meet our needs, we may seek to raise capital through debt financing. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and may include operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. If we decide to raise capital through equity financing, the issuance of additional equity may result in dilution to our shareholders. We cannot be certain that any financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we h a d 176.2 million and 175.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, respectively. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash primarily consist of cash on hand, restricted cash, and short-term bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Of the 176.2 million and 175.5 million cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, 92.7 million and 55.0 million, respectively, are deposited with financial institutions outside the United States.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 There have been no material changes in the market risks previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 23, 2024. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective and provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls 
 While our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective objectives will be met, we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors and all fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 As previously disclosed, the Company continues to cooperate with the Department of Commerce DOC in connection with its ongoing investigation of the Company s export control practices. DOC has not informed the Company of any specific timeline or schedule under which DOC will complete its review.
