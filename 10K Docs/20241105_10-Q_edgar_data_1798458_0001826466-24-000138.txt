shares and is a wholly owned
 subsidiary of the Company. 
 The Company was formed for the purpose of researching and
 developing a concept for an Event Center with many additional associated
 businesses on the same grounds of the Event Center. For several years, the
 Company did extensive research on Event Centers throughout Colorado, Utah,
 Nevada and Arizona. 
 The Covid-19 Pandemic and other circumstances negatively
 affected the event center business and ultimately our ability to raise capital
 and move forward with our original business plan. However, now that the Pandemic
 has subsided, the Company intends to move forward. 
 
 The Company s ability to achieve a level of profitable operations
and/or additional financing impacts the Company s ability to continue as it is
presently organized. Management continues to develop its planned principal
operations. Should management be unsuccessful in its operating activities, the
Company may substantially curtail or terminate its operations. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

On June 1, 2023, the Company entered into a letter of intent to
 purchase an 8050 Sq. Ft. building in Mesa, Maricopa County, Arizona. When
 completed, the purchase will be funded with common or preferred stock of the
 Company and debt. It is expected that the transaction may be completed in the
fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Our focus for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, will be
 on continuing our attempt to raise additional capital, increasing research as to
 the overall concept, contacting companies that could possibly be a part of the
 Carriage House Event Center concept and completing a transaction on a facility.

 amount of was cancelled and a new Promissory Note in the amount of

 The Company entered into a promissory note with Venturevest Capital Corporation

 obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results,
 changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking
 information, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we
 do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn
 that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other
 forward-looking statements. 
 Business Overview 
 Carriage House Event Center, Inc. we, us, our, the
 Company or Carriage House was incorporated in the state of Colorado on June
26, 2010. On September 11, 2018, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary company,
Blue Carriage Events, Inc. 
 As of the date of this filing, we have not conducted any
 business through the Company or through our subsidiary other than research. Our
 principal executive offices are located at 558 Castle Pines Parkway, B-4, Suite
 140, Castle Pines, CO 80108 Telephone 303-517-8845. 
 We have not generated revenue to date. Our operations since
 2010 to date have consisted of extensive research of our concept and filing an
 S-1 registration statement. 
 Our independent accountants have expressed a going concern opinion on our December 31, 2023 and 2022 audited financial statements. 
 In 2020, the Company filed an S-1 Registration Statement to register 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be sold to the public at the price of 0.10 per share for a total of 100,000. The Registration Statement became
 effective on May 8, 2020. 
 9 

The Company sold 300,000 shares of common stock at 0.10 per share for gross proceeds of 30,000. The shares were sold by the officers and Directors of the Company and no broker commissions were paid. There is no guarantee that additional
shares will be sold from the Registration Statement. 
 Our management and related parties own a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, management and affiliates own 4,120,000 shares (92.6 and shareholders holding the free trading shares own 300,000 shares (6.7 .
 As a result, management has the ability to determine the outcome on all matters requiring the approval of our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. 
 The Company was formed for the purpose of researching and developing a concept of an Event Center with many additional associated businesses on the grounds of the Event Center. As a result of the Covid-19 Pandemic and other circumstances that have
 negatively affected the event center business and ultimately our ability to raise capital and move forward with our original business plan. However, now that the Pandemic has subsided, the Company intends to move forward with the original business
 plan. If the Company is unable to raise the required funds to fulfill its business plan, the Company may seek other opportunities including a possible merger, acquisition and/or change of our business plan. 
 On June 1, 2023, the Company entered into a letter of intent to purchase an 8050 Sq. Ft. building in Mesa, Maricopa County, Arizona. This is a prime location in the heart of Mesa and would be excellent for servicing a very wide area. In Maricopa
 County there were 26,272 weddings in 2022 at an average cost of 36,739 The Wedding Report as well as thousands of other types of meetings held in its event centers. When completed, the purchase will be funded with common or
 preferred stock of the Company and debt. It is expected that the transaction may be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a
 material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have not identified any critical accounting estimates. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates,
 judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results which are found in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting
 Policies in the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly
 from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 
 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not earn any revenue. 
 Operating Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had general and administrative expenses of 13,600 and 2,803, respectively, an increase of 10,797 or 385.2 . In the current period we incurred 10,000 of consulting fees
 that we did not have in the prior period. 
 Net Loss 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 13,600 and 2,803, respectively. 
 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not earn any revenue. 
 Operating Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had general and administrative expenses of 23,005 and 11,634, respectively, an increase of 11,371 or 97.7 . In the current period we incurred 10,000 of consulting fees
 that we did not have in the prior period. 
 Net Loss 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 23,005 and 11,634, respectively. 
 Operating Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had general and administrative expenses of 23,005 and 11,634, respectively, an increase of 11,371 or 97.7 . In the current period we incurred 10,000 of consulting fees
 that we did not have in the prior period. 
 Net Loss 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 23,005 and 11,634, respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash balance at September 30, 2024 was 32,001, with 180,800 in loans payable to related parties. If we experience a shortage of funds in the next twelve months, we may utilize additional funds from our director, A. Terry Ray, who has
 agreed to advance funds for operations, however there is no formal commitment, arrangement, or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to us. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 24,005 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 11,634 used for operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 10 

Investing Activities 
 We neither generated nor used cash in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 30,000 from a related party loan and used 3,000 to repay related party loans compared to receiving 55,000 from related party loans in the prior period. 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
 business. The Company currently has limited operations, and a stockholders deficit of 148,799 with an accumulated deficit of 182,949 at September 30, 2024. If the Company cannot fulfill its business plan, the Company may attempt to
 find a merger target in the form of an operating entity. The Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in this strategy. 
 These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not Applicable. 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer
 and Principal Financial Officer, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
 controls and procedures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. The term disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a
company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses,
management believes the financial statements included in this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over
 financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by
 paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred
 during quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is
 reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
 reporting.
