with Duke Inc. surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Following the above transactions, Duke
Israel became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Duke Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

The Company (collectively with Duke,
the Group is a robotics company dedicated to the development of an advanced robotics stabilization system that enables
remote, real-time, pinpoint accurate firing of small arms and light weapons as well as other civilian applications with an emphasis on
the field of infrastructure maintenance. The Company s advanced robotics system is able to achieve pinpoint accuracy regardless
of the movement of the weapons platform or the target. 

B. 
 In October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern
border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks
on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State
of Israel. These attacks resulted in extensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping of civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s
security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist organizations commenced in parallel to their
continued rocket and terror attacks. Following the attack by Hamas on Israel s southern border, Hezbollah in Lebanon also launched
missile, rocket, drone and shooting attacks against Israeli military sites, troops and Israeli towns in northern Israel. In addition,
Iran recently launched direct attacks on Israel and has threatened to continue to attack Israel. Iran is also believed to have a strong
influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and various rebel
militia groups in Syria and Iraq. While currently limited damage was registered in Israel from the Iranian attacks, the situation is developing
and could lead to additional wars and hostilities in the Middle East. In October 2024, Israel began limited ground operations against Hezbollah
in Lebanon. It is possible that the hostilities with Hezbollah will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations, including Palestinian
military organizations in the West Bank, as well as other hostile countries, will join the hostilities. Such hostilities may include terror
and missile attacks.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

Readers are advised to
review the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial
statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements
and related notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Some of the information contained in

for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements . You should review the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023, for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied
by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis . 

We
are a robotics company developing an advanced robotics system that enables remote, real-time, pinpoint accurate firing of small arms and
light weapons. Our advanced robotics system can achieve pinpoint accuracy regardless of the movement of the weapons platform or the target.
We also introduced an insulator cleaning drone, which is a drone technology for conducting routine maintenance of critical infrastructure
for cleaning electric utility cable insulators. 

We
were founded in 2014 as Unlimited Aerial Systems, LLP UAS LLP ), and until the consummation of the Share Exchange Agreement
(as hereinafter defined), we were a developer and manufacturer of commercial unmanned aerial systems, or drones, intending to provide
a superior Quadrotor aerial platform at an affordable price point in the law enforcement and first responder markets. 

On March 9, 2020, we closed on the Share Exchange Agreement (the Share
Exchange Agreement ), under which Duke Robotics, Inc., a Delaware corporation Duke Inc. became our majority-owned
subsidiary (the Share Exchange ). Such closing date is referred to as the Effective Time. As a result of the
Share Exchange, the Company adopted the business plan of Duke Inc. 

On April 29, 2020, we, Duke Inc., and UAS Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary UAS Sub ), executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ),
under which UAS Sub was to merge, upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, with and into Duke Inc., with Duke Inc. surviving
as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the Short-Form Merger ). Under the Merger Agreement, we intended to acquire the remaining
outstanding shares of Duke Inc. held by those certain Duke Inc. shareholders who did not participate in the Share Exchange. On June 25,
2020, Duke Inc. filed a Certificate of Merger with the State of Delaware, and consequently, Duke Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary
and the Short-Form Merger was consummated. 

On
January 29, 2021, we, through Duke Airborne Systems Ltd. Duke Israel ), and Elbit Systems Land Ltd., an Israeli corporation Elbit ), entered into a collaboration agreement (the Collaboration Agreement for the global marketing and
sales, and the production and further development of our developed advanced robotic system mounted on a UAS, armed with lightweight firearms,
which we market under the commercial name TIKAD. 

On August 15, 2022, Duke Israel introduced the Insulator Cleaning IC Drone, a drone technology for conducting routine maintenance of critical infrastructure, and has signed an agreement with Israel Electric
Corporation (the IEC to provide drone-enabled systems for cleaning electric utility cable insulators. During October
2023, we completed our obligations under the agreement with the IEC. This was followed in August 2024, by a new agreement with the IEC
to utilize our innovative IC Drone system for cleaning electric utility cable insulators. 

Duke Inc. has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Duke Israel, which was formed
under the laws of the State of Israel in March 2014 and became the sole subsidiary of Duke Inc. after its incorporation. Our mailing address
is 10 HaRimon Street, Mevo Carmel Science and Industrial Park, Israel 2069203, and our telephone number is 011-972-4-8124101. Our website

Critical Accounting Policies 

In
connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we were required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and
apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our assumptions,
estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time
our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Regularly, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and
judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our
assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 

Please
see Note 2 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, reference
is made to Part I, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (filed on March 15, 2024) concerning our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

Our research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 20,000, compared to 0 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was mainly due to our continuous research and development
efforts in 2024 following the completion of the agreement with the IEC towards the end of 2023. 

General and Administrative. 
Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of professional services and legal expenses, amounted to 229,000, compared to 173,000,
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2024, was mainly due to an increase in professional services partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expenses. 

Financial Income, net. 
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had financial income of 7,000 compared to financial income of 23,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The reason for the decrease in financial income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was mainly
due to decrease in income from interest on our bank deposits. 

17 

Net Loss. We incurred
a net loss of 211,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 150,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, for the reasons set forth above. 

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues . Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 72,000,
compared to no revenue during the nine months period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues is attributable to the launch
of our commercial IC Drone for purposes of power grid insulator cleaning activities with the IEC, which commenced in the third quarter
of 2024. 

Cost of revenues . Our cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
totaled to 41,000, compared to no cost of revenue during the nine months period ended September 30, 2023. The
increase is attributable to the launch of our commercial IC Drone power grid insulator cleaning activity with the IEC, which commenced
in the third quarter of 2024. 

Research and Development. 
Our research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 137,000, compared to 0 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was mainly due to our continuous research and development
efforts in 2024 following the completion of the agreement with the IEC towards the end of 2023. 

General and Administrative. 
Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, which consisted primarily of professional services and legal expenses, amounted to 636,000, compared to 581,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was
mainly due to an increase in professional services and in rent and office expenses partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation
expenses. 

Financial Income, net. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had financial income of 44,000 compared to financial income of 69,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The reason for the decrease in financial income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was mainly
due to decrease in revenues from interest on our bank deposits. 

Net Loss. We incurred
a net loss of 698,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 512,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, for the reasons set forth above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had 1,436,000 in cash on September 30, 2024, versus 2,358,000
in cash on September 30, 2023. The reason for the decrease in our cash balance was due to our development efforts and operating expenses
described above. Cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 739,000 as compared to cash used in operations
of 469,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reason for the increase in cash used in operations is related to an increase
in our net loss and a decrease in other liabilities. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 76,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of 18,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase is mainly attributable to purchase of property and equipment related to our commercial IC Drone for purposes of power grid
insulator cleaning activities with the IEC. 

18 

On
May 11, 2021, we entered into securities purchase agreements with eight (8) non-U.S. investors, (the Holders ), according
to which we, in a private placement offering, agreed to issue and sell to the Holders an aggregate of: (i) 12,500,000 shares of our common
stock at 0.40 per share; and (ii) warrants to purchase 12,500,000 of our common stock. The warrants were exercisable immediately and
for a term of 18 months and had an exercise price of 0.40 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the offering were approximately
 5,000,000 and the offering closed on May 11, 2021. On April 5, 2022, we entered into an agreement with the Holders pursuant to which
we extended the term of the warrants, to expire on November 11, 2023. On November 1, 2023, we and the Holders executed a second extension
agreement, such that the term of the warrants was extended so that they now expire on November 11, 2024. On June 20, 2024, we entered
into a warrant amendment agreement with the Holders in which the its was agreed to (i) extend the warrant exercise term to May 11, 2026;
(ii) amend the warrant exercise price and increase it from 0.40 per share to 0.65 per share; and (iii) include a beneficial ownership
blocker that limits the exercise of such warrants if such exercise would result in the holder beneficially owning in excess of 19.99 
of the number of our common stock immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of
the warrant. 

We
believe that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Readers are advised that available resources
may be consumed more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than expected. Should this
occur, we will need to seek additional capital earlier than anticipated in order to fund (1) further development and, if needed (2) expenses
which will be required in order to expand manufacturing of our products, (3) sales and marketing efforts and (4) general working capital.
Such funding may be unavailable to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain such funding when needed could create a negative
impact on our stock price or could potentially lead to the failure of our company. This would particularly be the case if we are unable
to commercially distribute our products and services in the jurisdictions and in the timeframes we expect. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024,
we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting
company and therefore are not required to provide the information for this item of Form 10-Q. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer the Certifying Officers ),
conducted evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls
and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. 

Based on their evaluation,
the Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the above-described
reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
