. 

For the year ended March 31, 2024,
84 of total accounts receivable was owed by one customer in the amount of . 

which
resulted in a net operating loss for income tax purposes. The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately at
the effective statutory rate of 21 . The deferred tax asset has been offset by an equal valuation allowance. Given our inception on February
26, 2021, and our fiscal year end of March 31, 2024, we have completed four taxable fiscal years. 

Potential
benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The
Company has incurred a net operating loss carryforward of 2,217,836 which begins expiring in 2036. The Company has adopted ASC 740,
 Accounting for Income Taxes , as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740 the Company is required to compute tax asset
benefits for non-capital losses carried forward. The potential benefit of the net operating loss has not been recognized in these
financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the loss carried forward in
future years. 

Due to the
change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes
are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future
years

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives,
and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 

These
forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, 
 will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar
expressions. 

Forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results
to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies
is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not
limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and
generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements
and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 

Company
Overview 

We operate through our wholly owned subsidiaries, which, as of the date of this report, include Dr. Foods Co., Ltd., a Japan Corporation DRFS Japan ), and Dr. Foods Co., Ltd., a Dr. Foods (S) PTE. LTD. DRFS Singapore ). DRFS Singapore has no material
transactions or operations to report as of the date of this report. Our operations have been primarily carried out through DRFS Japan. 

At
present, our principal focus is on the creation of plant-based food products to replace traditional animal products, while retaining
the taste and texture of the original. 

At
present, we are researching and developing various food products for consumption. These include, but are not limited to, vegan
caviar, cultured caviar, and vegan truffle butter. 

We have developed and brought to market for sale
a product we refer to as, Dr. Foie Gras . It is a replacement for the traditional, liver based product derived
from a duck or goose. Our version is made predominantly from a mixture of nuts, beans, and other plant based materials, created
through a method of fermentation. Dr. Foie Gras is manufactured by Mama Foods Co., Ltd., a Japanese Company, currently indirectly
owned and controlled by our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka. 

At this time we offer Dr. Foie Gras to customer(s)
in Japan, although we seek to expand our reach to customers globally in the future, although we cannot forecast with any level of specificity
when that may be, or if it will be feasible. 

We have only had nominal sales to date of Dr. Foie
Gras, but we believe this is due to the limited period of time it has been made available to the public, and due to limited or no marketing
efforts on behalf of the Company to promote or sell the product. 

At this time, we have no marketing plan and we intend
to rely on Next Meats Holdings, Inc., and or its subsidiaries (referred to herein collectively as Next Meats ), to promote
Dr. Foie Gras. We intend to compensate Next Meats for such services on a case by case basis. As described below under Officers,
Employees, and Compensation , Next Meats may elect to provide us temporary staff to fulfill any marketing services we require,
whereas we will reimburse Next Meats for any associated costs. Further, we cannot forecast with any level of specificity when we will
have a definitive marketing plan if ever we do have one. 

We
have entered into a collaborative effort wherein we dedicate our staff, along with the staff of Mama Foods Co., Ltd., to develop and produce
Next Kalbi Chips (this is a short-rib style alternative meat product) for Next Meats Co., Ltd. When this product is finalized, Mama Foods
Co., Ltd. plans to sell the Next Kalbi Chips to Next Meats Co., Ltd., who plans to then sell the Next Kalbi Chips to their customers. 

Although
our staff is collaborating with the development of the Next Kalbi Chips, at this point in time Japan Food Tech Holdings, Inc., and its
subsidiaries, will not generate any revenue, and do not benefit in any material way, from this collaborative effort. We believe that
the only circumstance in which we would benefit from this arrangement would be if we were to acquire Mama Foods Co., Ltd., which at this
time is speculative and unlikely in the foreseeable future. 

Our customers to date were garnered through
personal relationships of our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka. 

Note: Our sole officer and director, Koichi
Ishizuka, is the controlling shareholder of Next Meats Holdings, Inc., a Nevada Corporation. He is also the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of Next Meats Holdings, Inc. Next Meats Co., Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Next Meats Holdings, Inc. 

Patents 

We have filed a patent application with the Japanese
Patent Office pertaining to the production method we employ to create our product, referred to as, Dr. Foie Gras . The patent
describes a new method of making an animal-free "foie gras" substitute in which nuts or beans are fermented by fungi to mimic the taste
of liver without the need for miso, soy sauce, yeast extract, or other separately fermented materials. The application number is 2022-61974.
It was filed on April 1, 2022 and is pending review. 

Officers,
Employees, and Compensation 

At
this time, we have one officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka. We do not have any contractual employees or staff. However, pursuant to
an arrangement with Next Meats Co., Ltd., a Japan Corporation, Next Meats Co., Ltd. provides temporary employees (staff) to our Company
as needed to further our business agenda. Regarding this arrangement, we are billed by Next Meats Co. Ltd. on a case by case basis depending
on the amount of staff and hours allocated by each staff member to our business endeavors, primarily consisting of research and development. 

Although
under no contractual obligations, our wholly owned subsidiary, Dr. Foods Co., Ltd., has three executive officers, which currently are
comprised of Koichi Ishizuka, Dr. Iaroslav Patuk and Hideo Fujioka. Dr. Iaroslav Patuk and Hideo Fujioka are contractual
employees of Next Meats Co., Ltd. and provide services to our Company on a need be basis as described above. In the event
that we utilize their services, we are billed directly by Next Meats Co., Ltd. 

Mergers
and Acquisitions 

On January 12, 2022, Japan Food Tech Holdings, Inc., formerly
known as, Dr. Foods, Inc., a Nevada Company, Mama Foods Co., Ltd., a Japan Company, and White Knight Co., Ltd., a Japan
Company entered into a non-definitive agreement, a Letter of Intent , whereas it was proposed that Dr. Foods, Inc., would
acquire 100 of the controlling interest of Mama Foods Co., Ltd. from related party, White Knight Co., Ltd., in exchange for 500,000
coupled with the issuance of 19,500,000 shares of restricted Preferred Stock to White Knight Co., Ltd. 

To proceed with the transaction the Issuer required, and
continues to require, an audit of Mama Foods Co., Ltd. for its last two completed fiscal years and a review of any interim periods following
the most recent fiscal year-end. It has been mandated that this requirement must be met before the transaction can move forward in any
capacity. 

White Knight Co., Ltd. is a Japanese entity owned and controlled
by Koichi Ishizuka. 

Mama Foods, Co., Ltd. Mama Foods is a food
company foun ded in Japan in 1958, currently offering customers in Japan wholesale and retail products
centering on Japanese side dishes, from chilled foods to packed and sterilized food. 

In 2021,
White Knight Co., Ltd. acquired 100 of Mama Foods from its prior controller, in exchange for approximately 1 million USD. The current
website for Mama Foods, which includes additional information, can be found here: mama-foods.com/en/ 

The
non-definitive agreement described above expired without the proposed terms of the non-definitive agreement being met and without the
transaction moving forward. Mama Foods Co., Ltd. did not provide the requested audited financials or related materials to the Issuer.
However, common management of both Mama Foods Co., Ltd. and Japan Food Tech Holdings, Inc., formerly known as, Dr. Foods, Inc., 
has verbally agreed to consider moving forward with the transaction if Mama Foods Co., Ltd. can eventually provide the required financial
documentation, which it has not done so to date. 

 The
preparation of Mama Foods Co., Ltd. s financial records is being led by Koichi Ishizuka, who has other business commitments and
limited availability. Additionally, he lacks accounting expertise, so the Company has hired an external accountant, with limited knowledge
themselves, to assist with this process. 

 Given
the current circumstances, it is highly improbable that the acquisition of Mama Foods Co., Ltd. will proceed in the foreseeable future
unless Koichi Ishizuka engages additional staff or third parties to expedite the preparation of the audited financials and related financial
information for Mama Food Co., Ltd. Even with such measures in place, the success of the audit still depends on Koichi Ishizuka providing
the necessary documentation and supporting information, which remains uncertain. 

 Any
investment in our common stock is extremely high risk and should only be made by those who can afford the entire loss of their investment.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash balance is 8,116 as of June 30, 2024. We have been utilizing funds from our Chief Executive Officer, Koichi Ishizuka to fund
our operations and we intend to rely on Koichi Ishizuka, and or related parties for funding going forward. 

Mr.
Ishizuka has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our
plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we may require further funding. Being a start-up stage company, we have very limited
operating history. After a twelve-month period we may need additional financing but currently do not have any arrangements for such financing. 

If
we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations
entirely. 

Revenues 

We
recorded revenue of 5,524 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Comparatively, we recorded revenue of 616 for the three months
ended June 30, 2023. This variance is attributed to an increase in food product sales through our subsidiary, Dr. Foods Co., Ltd.,
which occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The cost of revenues was 0 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and
the gross profit was 5,524. The cost of revenues was 0 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and the gross profit was
 616. 

Net
Income 

We
recorded a net loss of 81,311 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 68,362 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. 

The net loss for the above periods is primarily comprised of general and administrative expenses, which were in turn primarily attributed
to professional fees, and fees billed by Next Meats Co., Ltd. and Mama Food Co., Ltd. 

Cash
flow 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024, we had negative cash flows from operating activities in the amount of 75,921.
Comparatively, for the three months ended June 30, 2023, we had negative cash flows from operating activities in the
amount of 18,330. The variance is attributable to, amongst other things, accounts payable to a related party. 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024, we did not generate cash flows from investing activities. Comparatively, for the three
months ended June 30, 2023, we had negative cash flows from investing activities in the amount of 109,099. The variance is
attributable to the fact that during the three months ended June 30, 2023, we loaned cash to a related
party. 

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024, we had net cash flows from financing activities in the amount of 76,251. Comparatively,
for the three months ended June 30, 2023, we had net cash flows from financing activities in the amount of 209,546.
The variance is attributable to deceased sales of shares during the three months ended June 30, 2024, when compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2023. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern
that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one
year following the issuance of these financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating
loss, working capital deficiency, and other adverse key financial ratios. 

The
Company has not established sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related
party contributions to capital. There is no assurance that management's plan will be successful. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

ITEM 4 
 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our chief executive officer Koichi Ishizuka, who is also our chief financial officer (who is acting as our
principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

As
of June 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, who is also our chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to
material weaknesses identified below. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: Due to our small size, we did not have sufficient personnel in our accounting
and financial reporting functions. As a result, we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties and were not able to
provide for adequate review of the financial statements. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a
reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis; and we lacked sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the
requirements and application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements and the identification and approval of related party
transactions. 

Inherent
limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal
control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for
advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization,
and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject
to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented
by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process
and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have occurred for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
