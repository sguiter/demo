and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and (ii) the vote of a majority of the Board who are not interested persons (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) of the Company, the Adviser or any of their respective affiliates (the Independent Directors ). The Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment by the Adviser. On August 12, 2024, the Company's Board renewed the Advisory Agreement for an additional term through . The Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party, by vote of the Company s Board, or by a vote of the majority of the Company s outstanding voting units, without penalty upon not less than 60 days prior written notice to the applicable party. If the Advisory Agreement is terminated according to this paragraph, the Company will pay the Adviser a pro-rated portion of the Management Fee and Incentive Fee (each as defined below). Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will: formulate and implement the Company's investment program; 

 determine the composition of the portfolio of the Company, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of implementing such changes; 

 identify/source, research, evaluate and negotiate the structure of the investments made by the Company (including due diligence on prospective Portfolio Companies); 

 close, monitor and administer the Company's investments, including the exercise of any rights in its capacity as a lender; 

 determine the securities and other assets that the Company will originate, purchase, retain, or sell; 

 place orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities for the Company's account with broker-dealers selected by the Adviser; 

 pay such expenses as are incurred by it in connection with providing the foregoing services, subject to the reimbursement of certain expenses incurred on behalf of the Company to the extent described in the Administration Agreement (as defined below); 

 coordinate with the Administrator (as defined below) and; 

 provide the Company with such other investment advisory, research, and related services as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of its funds, including providing operating and managerial assistance to the Company and its portfolio companies as required. 

 The Company pays to the Adviser, quarterly in arrears, a management fee in cash (the Management Fee calculated as follows: (i.e., per annum) of the average gross assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, with the average determined based on the gross assets of the Company as of the end of the three most recently completed calendar months. Gross assets means the amortized cost of the Company s portfolio investments (including portfolio investments purchased with borrowed funds and other forms of leverage, such as preferred units, public and private debt issuances, derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and other similar instruments or arrangements) that have not been sold, distributed to members, or written off for tax purposes (but reduced by any portion of such cost basis that has been written down to reflect a permanent impairment of value of any portfolio investment), and excluding cash and cash equivalents. Installments of the Management Fee payable for any partial month or quarter shall be pro rated for the actual number of days in such period.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Management Fees incurred were and , respectively, and remai ned payable as of September 30, 2023. In addition, the Adviser will receive an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee as follows: (a) First, no Incentive Fee will be owed until the Common Unitholders have collectively received cumulative distributions pursuant to this clause (a) equal to their Aggregate Contributions (as defined in the LLC Agreement) to the Company in respect of all the Common Units; 

 (b) Second, no Incentive Fee will be owed until the Common Unitholders have collectively received cumulative distributions equal to a internal rate of return on their Aggregate Contributions to the Company in respect of all Common Units (the "Hurdle"); 

 (c) Third, the Adviser will be entitled to an Incentive Fee out of of additional amounts otherwise distributable to Common Unitholders until such time as the Incentive Fee paid to the Adviser is equal to of the sum of (A) the amount by which the Hurdle exceeds the Aggregate Contributions of the Common Unitholders in respect of all Common Units and (B) the amount of Incentive Fee being paid to the Adviser pursuant to this clause (c); and 

 (d) Thereafter, the Adviser will be entitled to an Incentive Fee equal to of additional amounts otherwise distributable to Common Unitholders in respect of all Common Units, with the remaining distributed to the Common Unitholders. 

 The Incentive Fee will be calculated on a cumulative basis and the amount of the Incentive Fee payable in connection with any distribution (or deemed distribution) will be determined and, if applicable, paid in accordance with the foregoing formula each time amounts are to be distributed to the Common Unitholders. For purposes of calculating the Incentive Fee, as provided in Section 3.3.2 of the LLC Agreement, Aggregate Contributions shall not include NAV Balancing Contributions or Late-Closer Contributions, and the distributions to Common Unitholders shall not include distributions attributable to Late-Closer Contributions (each capitalized term as defined in the LLC agreement). NAV Balancing Contributions received by the Company will not be treated as amounts distributed to Common Unitholders for purposes of calculating the Incentive Fee. In addition, if distributions to which a Defaulting Member (as defined in the LLC Agreement) otherwise would have been entitled have been withheld pursuant to Section 6.2.4 of the LLC Agreement, the amounts so withheld shall be treated for such purposes as having been distributed to such Defaulting Member. The amount of any distribution of securities made in kind shall be equal to the fair market value of those securities at the time of distribution determined pursuant to Section 13.4 of the LLC Agreement. If the Advisory Agreement terminates early for any reason other than (i) the Adviser voluntarily terminating the Advisory Agreement or (ii) the Company terminating the Advisory Agreement for cause, the Company will be required to pay the Adviser a final incentive fee payment (the "Final Incentive Fee Payment"). The Final Incentive Fee Payment will be calculated as of the date the Advisory Agreement is so terminated and will equal the amount of Incentive Fee that would be payable to the Adviser if (A) all of the Company's investments were liquidated for their current value (but without taking into account any unrealized appreciation of any Portfolio Investment (as defined in the LLC Agreement)), and any unamortized deferred Portfolio Investment-related fees were deemed accelerated, (B) the proceeds from such liquidation were used to pay all of the Company's outstanding liabilities, and (C) the remainder were distributed to Common Unitholders and paid as Incentive Fee in accordance with Section 6(a) of the Advisory Agreement. The Company will make the Final Incentive Fee Payment in cash on or immediately following the date the Advisory Agreement is so terminated. In the case of an early termination, the Adviser Return Obligation under Section 6(c) of the Advisory Agreement will not apply in connection with a Final Incentive Fee Payment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Incentive Fees incurred were and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Incentive Fees incurred were and , respectively.

 (each, an "Interim Incentive Fee Date"), and after the Company has made its final distribution of assets pursuant to Section 9.2 of the LLC Agreement (the Final Incentive Fee Date ), if the Adviser has received aggregate payments of Final Incentive Fee, or with respect to the Interim Incentive Fee only, an amount equal to or greater than in e xcess of the Adviser Target Amount (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) as of such time (an Adviser Return Event ), then the Adviser shall return to the Company in cash on or before the 90th day after such Interim Incentive Fee Date or Final Incentive Fee Date, as the case may be, an amount equal to such excess (the "Adviser Return Obligation"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall the Adviser Return Obligation exceed an amount greater than the aggregate amount of Incentive Fee payments previously received by (or allocated to) the Adviser from the Company with respect to the two Interim Incentive Fee Dates immediately preceding such Adviser Return Event, reduced by the excess (if any) of (a) the aggregate federal, state and local income tax liability the Adviser incurred in connection with the payment of such Incentive Fees (assuming the highest marginal applicable federal and New York City and State income tax rates applied to such payments), over (b) an amount equal to the U.S. federal and state tax benefits available to the Adviser by virtue of the payment made by the Adviser pursuant to its Adviser Return Obligation (assuming that, to the extent such payments are deductible by the Adviser, the benefit of such deductions will be computed using the then highest marginal applicable federal and New York City and State income tax rates), as reasonably determined by the Adviser. The Adviser Return Obligation shall be recomputed to take into account any post-liquidation returns of distributions made by Members pursuant to Section 11.4 of the LLC Agreement, and any additional Adviser Return Obligation triggered by such post- liquidation returns shall be made by the Adviser contemporaneously with such post- liquidation returns by the Members. Administration Agreement : On September 15, 2022, the Company entered into an Administration Agreement (the Administration Agreement with TCW Asset Management Company LLC (in such capacity, the Administrator ). Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator will furnish us with office facilities and equipment, and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services.

The Administrator may perform these services directly, may delegate some or all of them through the retention of a sub-administrator and may remove or replace any sub-administrator. Payments under the Administration Agreement will be equal to an amount that reimburses the Administrator for the costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement. The amounts paid pursuant to the Administration Agreement are subject to the Company Expenses Limitation (as defined below). The Administrator agrees that it would not charge total fees under the Administration Agreement that would exceed its reasonable estimate of what a qualified third party would charge to perform substantially similar services. The costs and expenses paid by the Company and the applicable caps on certain costs and expenses are described below under Expenses . The Administration Agreement provides that neither the Administrator, nor any director, officer, agent or employee of the Administrator, shall be liable or responsible to the Company or any of the Unitholders for any mistake in judgment, any act performed or omission made by such person or losses due to the mistake, action, inaction, or negligence of other agents of the Company. The Company will also indemnify the Administrator and its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it.

For simplicity, this report uses the terms Company, we, us, and our to refer to TCW Star Direct Lending LLC. 
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, would, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation: 
 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 

an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies which we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 

interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results; 

a decline in interest rates could adversely impact our results as all of our investments bear interest based on floating rates;

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their financial and other business objectives;

the other risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify under Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, the forward- looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward- looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this report because we are an investment company. 
 Overview 
 We were formed on March 7, 2022 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have conducted private offerings of our common limited liability company units (the Units to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. On September 1, 2022, we filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and made such an election beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2022. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. 
 On September 15, 2022, (the Closing Date we began accepting subscription agreements from investors for the private sale of our Units. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 3,753,190 Units for an aggregate offering price of 375.3 million. Each Unitholder is obligated to contribute capital equal to their Commitment and each Unit s Commitment obligation is 100.00 per unit. The sale of the Units was made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by us and each investor. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, we may draw down all or any portion of the undrawn commitment with respect to each Unit generally upon at least ten business days prior written notice to the unitholders. The amount of capital that remains to be drawn down and contributed is referred to as an Undrawn Commitment. 
 Our Commitment Period commenced on the Closing Date and will end four years from the later of (a) September 15, 2026, four years from the Closing Date and (b) four years from the date in which the Company first completed an investment. However, the Commitment Period is subject to termination upon the occurrence of Key Person Event defined as follows: A Key Person Event will occur if, during the Commitment Period, (i) Richard T. Miller and one or more Suzanne Grosso, Mark Gertzof and David Wang (each of such four Persons, a Key Person and collectively, the Key Persons fail to devote substantially all (i.e. more than 85 of his or her business time to the investment activities of the Company, the prior funds, any successor funds and any fund(s) managed by the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser that are managed within the Private Credit Group (together, the Related Entities or (ii) Ms. Grosso, Mr. Gertzof and Mr. Wang all fail to devote substantially all of their business time to the investment activities of the Company and the Related Entities, in each case other than as a result of a temporary disability; provided that if a replacement has been approved as described in the paragraphs below, such replacement shall be specifically designated to take the place of one of the above-named individuals and the definition Key Person Event will be amended to take into account such successor. 
 Upon the occurrence of a Key Person Event, and in the event that the Adviser fails to replace the above-referenced individuals in the manner contemplated by the last sentence of this paragraph, the Commitment Period shall be automatically terminated upon such Key Person Event. The Commitment Period will be re-instated upon the vote or written consent of 66 2/3 in interest of the Unitholders. The Adviser is permitted at any time to replace any person designated above with a senior professional (including a Key Person) selected by the Adviser, provided that such replacement has been approved by a majority of the Unitholders (in which case, the approved substitute will be a Key Person in lieu of the person replaced). The determination of whether a Key Person Event has occurred will be made by the Company in accordance with the criteria set out above. The Company shall provide written notice to Unitholders of such Key Person Event within 30 days of the date of such Key Person Departure. If the Company fails to obtain approval of a replacement of a Key Person following a Key Person Departure as provided herein, then notwithstanding anything herein, the Key Person Departure shall be permanent and the Adviser shall not be permitted to replace such Key Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser is permitted at any time to replace any Person designated above with a senior professional 
 29 

(including a Key Person) selected by the Adviser, with the approval of the majority of the Unitholders (in which case, the approved substitute shall be a Key Person in lieu of the Person replaced) no later than 90 days after the date that the Adviser informs the Company of its proposed replacement of the Key Person. If such replacement(s) end the occurrence of a Key Person Event, the Commitment Period will automatically be re-instated. 
 In accordance with the Company s Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, the Company may complete investment transactions that were significantly in process as of the end of the Commitment Period and which the Company reasonably expects to be consummated prior to 90 days after the expiration date of the Commitment Period. The Company may also effect follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies up to an aggregate maximum of 10 of aggregate cumulative invested amounts. 
 We commenced operations during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. 
 During the year-ended December 31, 2023, we formed three wholly-owned subsidiaries - TCW Star DLG-1 LLC, TCW Star DLG-2 LLC and TCW Star DLG-3 LLC each a Delaware limited liability company and each designed to be signatories on debt investments of ours. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income and capital appreciation by providing private capital to middle market companies operating in a broad range of industries primarily in the United States. Our highly negotiated private investments include senior secured loans, unsecured senior loans, subordinated and mezzanine loans, convertible securities, notes and other non-convertible debt securities, equity securities, and equity-linked securities such as options and warrants. However, our investment bias is towards adjustable-rate, senior secured loans. We do not anticipate a secondary market developing for our private investments. Although we do not currently expect the Private Credit Group to originate a significant amount of investments for us with the use of payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest features, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, from time to time we may make investments that contain such features or that subsequently incorporate such features after origination. 
 We are primarily focused on investing in senior secured debt obligations, although there may be occasions where the investment may be unsecured. We will also consider an equity investment as the primary security, in combination with a debt obligation, or as a part of total return strategy. Our investments are mostly in corporations, partnerships or other business entities. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we may co-invest with other investors and/or strategic partners indirectly in a company through an Investment Vehicle. While we will invest primarily in U.S. companies, there may be certain instances where we will invest in companies domiciled elsewhere. 
 Expenses 
 We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business will be provided through the Administration Agreement and the Advisory Agreement. 
 We, and indirectly our Unitholders, will bear all costs, expenses and liabilities in connection with our operations, administration and transactions, including, without limitation: (a) organizational expenses and expenses associated with the issuance of the Units and issuance of interests in a Related Entity organized and managed by TCW as a feeder fund for the Company; (b) expenses of calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); (c) fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants, attorneys or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; (d) expenses incurred by the Adviser or the Administrator payable to third parties, including agents, consultants, attorneys or other advisors, relating to or associated with monitoring our financial and legal affairs, providing administrative services, monitoring or administering our investments and performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments and the corresponding portfolio companies; (e) costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the 1934 Act and other applicable federal or state securities laws; (f) fees and expenses incurred in connection with debt incurred to finance our investments or operations, and payment of interest and repayment of principal on such debt; (g) expenses related to sales and purchases of Units and other securities; (h) Management Fees and Incentive Fees; (i) administrator fees and expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, provided that any such fees payable to the Administrator shall be limited to what a qualified third party would charge to perform substantially similar services; (j) transfer agent, sub-administration and custodial fees; (k) expenses relating to the issue, repurchase and transfer of Units to the extent not borne by the relevant transferring Unitholders and/or assignees; (l) federal and state registration fees; (m) federal, state and local taxes or other governmental charges assessed against us; (n) independent directors' fees and expenses and the costs associated with convening a meeting of our board of directors or any committee thereof; (o) fees and 
 30 

expenses and the costs associated with convening a meeting of the Unitholders or holders of any Preferred Units; (p) costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to Unitholders, including printing and mailing costs; (q) costs and expenses related to the preparation of our financial statements and tax returns; (r) our allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; (s) direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, and copying; (t) independent auditors and outside legal costs, including legal costs associated with any requests for exemptive relief, "no-action" positions or other guidance sought from a regulator, pertaining to us; (u) compensation of other personnel (including employees and secretarial and other staff of the Administrator) to the extent they are devoted to preparing our financial statements or tax returns or providing similar "back office" financial services to us; (v) Adviser costs and expenses (excluding travel) in connection with identifying and investigating investment opportunities for us, monitoring our investments and disposing of any such investments; (w) portfolio risk management costs; (x) commissions or brokerage fees or similar charges incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of securities (including merger fees); (y) costs and expenses attributable to normal and extraordinary investment banking, commercial banking, accounting, auditing, appraisal, valuation, administrative agent activities, custodial and registration services provided to us, including in each case services with respect to the proposed purchase or sale of securities by us that are not reimbursed by the issuer of such securities or others (whether or not such purchase or sale is consummated); (z) costs of amending, restating or modifying the LLC Agreement or Advisory Agreement or related documents of us or related entities; (aa) fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with our termination, liquidation or dissolution or related entities; and (bb) all other properly and reasonably chargeable expenses incurred by the Company or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. 
 However, we will not bear more than (a) an amount equal to 10 basis points of our aggregate Commitments for organizational expenses and offering expenses in connection with the offering of Units. 
 "Adviser Operating Expenses" means overhead and operating and administrative expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Adviser or any of its affiliates, including us, in connection with maintaining and operating the Adviser's office, including salaries and other compensation (including compensation due to its officers), rent, routine office equipment expense and liability and insurance premiums (other than (i) those incurred in maintaining fidelity bonds and Indemnitee insurance policies and (ii) the allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations), in furtherance of providing supervisory investment management services for us. For the avoidance of doubt, Adviser Operating Expenses include any expenses incurred by the Adviser or its affiliates in connection with the Adviser's registration as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Advisers Act"), or with its compliance as a registered investment adviser thereunder. 
 All Adviser Operating Expenses and all our expenses that we will not bear, as set forth above, will be borne by the Adviser or its affiliates. 
 Costs incurred to organize the Company are expensed as incurred. Offering costs are accumulated and will be charged directly to Members Capital during the same period in which an initial capital is made. We will not bear more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of the aggregate capital commitments to the Company through the Units (the Commitments of the Company for organization and offering costs in connection with the offering of the Units through the Closing Period. As of September 30, 2024, we have incurred 0.1 million in organizational costs since inception, of which 0 was expensed during nine months ended September 30, 2024. Since inception, we have incurred 5.2 thousand in offering costs, all of which are charged to Members' Capital during the fourth quarter of the period ended December 31, 2022. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investments which we hold for which market quotes are not readily available or are not considered reliable are valued at fair value according to procedures approved by the Board of Directors (the Board based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as the "valuation designee" with respect to the fair valuation of our portfolio securities, subject to oversight by and periodic reporting to the Board. 
 Fair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by us into three levels based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value: 
 Level 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. 
 31 

Level 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs. 
 Level 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect our determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets. 
 Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
 Level 1 Assets (Investments) : The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows: 
 Equity, (Level 1) , generally includes common stock valued at the closing price on the primary exchange in which the security trades. 
 Level 2 Assets (Investments) : The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows: 
 Equity, (Level 2) , generally includes warrants valued using quotes for comparable investments. 
 Level 3 Assets (Investments): The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine the fair value of investments in private debt and equity for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable. 
 Debt, (Level 3) , includes investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. An income method approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital and discount rate or a market method approach using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets are generally used to determine fair value, though some cases use an enterprise value waterfall method. Valuation may also include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events. 
 Equity , (Level 3), generally includes common stock, preferred stock and warrants. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA; market multiples of comparable companies; comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; and contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. When a Black-Scholes pricing model is used it follows the income approach. The pricing model takes into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs, including: time value, implied volatility, equity prices and interest rates. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied. 
 Pricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments. 
 Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of 31 debt investments and one equity investment. Based on fair values as of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was 100.0 invested in debt investments which were all senior secured term and revolving loans and 0.0 invested in an equity investment which was a warrant. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio consisted of 19 debt investments and no equity investments. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2023, our portfolio was 100.0 invested in debt investments which were all senior secured term and revolving loans.

Total investment income 
 Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included interest income (including interest income paid-in-kind) of 6.0 million and 3.7 million, respectively. Total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included interest income (including interest income paid-in-kind) of 15.8 million and 6.2 million, respectively. The increase in total investment income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to the increase in our portfolio of debt investments which increased from 17 as of September 30, 2023 to 31 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Net investment income 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.5 million and 1.8 million, respectively. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.1 million and 2.9 million, respectively. The increase in net investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to the increase in total investment income as described above coupled with a decrease in expenses. The increase in net investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to the increase in total investment income as described above partially offset by an increase in expenses.

Our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.5 million and 1.9 million, respectively. Our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include management fees attributed to the Adviser of 0.4 million and 0.3 million, respectively, as well as incentive fees of 0.6 million and 0.6 million, respectively. Our expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also include interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions of 0.1 million and 0.8 million, respectively. 
 Our total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.7 million and 3.3 million, respectively. Our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include management fees attributed to the Adviser of 1.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively, as well as incentive fees of 1.8 million and 0.6, respectively. Our expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also include interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions of 0.7 million and 1.4 million, respectively. 
 The total decrease in our expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions. Interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions decreased as we did not enter into any repurchase agreements with Barclays Bank Plc during the three months ended September 30, 2024 whereas we did enter into repurchase agreements with Barclays Bank Plc during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the weighted average interest rate of repurchase agreements entered into with Macquarie US Trading LLC decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions was partially offset by an increase to management fees. Management fees increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in our investment cost basis for which management fees are based. 
 The total increase in our expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in incentive fees as the Adviser was eligible to earn incentive fees during the entire nine months ended September 30, 2024 but was only eligible to earn incentive fees during the three months ended September 30, 2023 which was when the Adviser surpassed the 6.5 hurdle rate. Management fees also increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in our investment cost basis for which management fees are based. The increase in incentive fees and management fees was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions. Interest expense incurred on repurchase transactions decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as the amount of repurchase agreements entered into with Barclays Bank Plc decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the weighted average interest rate of repurchase agreements entered into with Macquarie US Trading LLC decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

In order to finance certain investment transactions, we may, from time to time, enter into repurchase agreements with Macquarie US Trading LLC Macquarie ), whereby we sell to Macquarie an investment that we hold and concurrently enter into an agreement to repurchase the same investment at an agreed-upon price at a future date, not to exceed 90-days from the date it was sold (each, a Macquarie Transaction ). 
 Additionally, we may, from time to time, enter into repurchase agreements with Barclays Bank PLC Barclays ), whereby we sell to Barclays our short-term investments and concurrently enter into an agreement to repurchase the same investments at an agreed-upon price at a future date, generally within 30-days (each, a Barclays Transaction and together with the Macquarie Transactions, the Repurchase Transactions ). 
 These Repurchase Transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings. Accordingly, the investments financed by these Repurchase Transactions remain on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as an asset, and we record a liability to reflect our repurchase obligation to Macquarie and Barclays (the Repurchase Obligations ). The Repurchase Obligations are presented on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as Repurchase Obligations. The Repurchase Obligations are secured by the respective investment or short-term investment that is the subject of the repurchase agreement. Interest expense associated with the Repurchase Obligations is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest expense on repurchase transactions. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into Barclays Transaction on January 2, 2024 and April 1, 2024 which settled on January 25, 2024 and April 25, 2024, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we entered into Barclays Transactions on January 3, 2023 and April 3, 2023 which settled on January 25, 2023 and April 25, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest expense incurred on the Barclays Transactions was 0 and 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense incurred on the Barclays Transactions was 0.2 million and 0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding Repurchase Obligations with Barclays. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into Macquarie Transactions which resulted in interest expense of 0.1 million and 0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest expense on repurchase transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we entered into Macquarie Transactions which resulted in interest expense of 0.7 million and 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest expense on repurchase transactions.The weighted average annual interest rate on Macquarie Transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.23 and 8.31 , respectively.

The Macquarie Transactions entered into by us during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are listed below, along with the respective investments which collateralize each Repurchase Obligation. Interest expense under these Repurchase Obligations is calculated as the product of (i) the difference in days between the trade date and the settlement date of the respective Macquarie Transaction and (ii) the interest rates listed in the tables below, as stipulated in the respective repurchase agreements.

ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 100 of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months. As of September 30, 2024, the percentage of our floating rate debt investments that bore interest based on an interest rate floor was 0 . Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because our debt investments bear interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on interest income (excluding the related incentive compensation impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure (dollar amounts in thousands):

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 41 

PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Leg al Proceedings 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Sales of unregistered securities 
 Other than sales of the Company s Units previously reported on Form 8-K, there have been no sales by the Company of unregistered securities.

The issuance of the Units pursuant to these subscription agreements and any draw by the Company under the related Commitments is expected to be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof, and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D thereunder.
