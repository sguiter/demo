EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of SL Green Realty Corp. and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "SL Green Realty Corp.," the "Company" or "SL Green" mean SL Green Realty Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P.; and references to "SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P.," the "Operating Partnership" or "SLGOP" mean SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms "we," "our" and "us" mean the Company and all the entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership. 
 The Company is a Maryland corporation which operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, and is the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership. As a general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Operating Partnership. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owns 93.58 of the outstanding general and limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and owns 9,200,000 Series I Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, noncontrolling investors held, in aggregate, a 6.42 limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. We refer to these interests as the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership. 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership are managed and operated as one entity. The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of the Company. The Company has no significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Operating Partnership are substantially the same. 
 Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership, stockholders' equity of the Company and partners' capital of the Operating Partnership are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company are accounted as noncontrolling interests, within mezzanine equity, in the Company's and the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements. 
 We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 Combined reports enhance investors' understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 Combined reports eliminate duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the Company's disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
 Combined reports create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
 consolidated financial statements; and 
 the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
 Note 11, Noncontrolling Interests on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 Note 12, Stockholders' Equity of the Company; and 
 Note 13, Partners' Capital of the Operating Partnership. 
 This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership, respectively, in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, in both their capacity as the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company and the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, have made the requisite certifications and that the Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

Green Management Corp., respectively, which are owned by the Operating Partnership. The Company has qualified, and expects to qualify in the current fiscal year, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and operates as a self-administered, self-managed REIT. A REIT is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and, through payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to minimize the payment of Federal income taxes at the corporate level. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our" and "us" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership. 
 Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership.

 Partnership Agreement 
 In accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, or the Operating Partnership Agreement, we allocate all distributions and profits and losses in proportion to the percentage of ownership interests of the respective partners, subject to the priority distributions with respect to preferred units and special provisions that apply to Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") Units. As the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, we are required to take such reasonable efforts, as determined by us in our sole discretion, to cause the Operating Partnership to distribute sufficient amounts to enable the payment of sufficient dividends by us to minimize any Federal income or excise tax at the Company level. Under the Operating Partnership Agreement, each limited partner has the right to redeem units of limited partnership interests for cash, or if we so elect, shares of SL Green's common stock on a one-for- basis.

 years to years. We amortize the amount allocated to the above- and below-market leases over the remaining term of the associated lease, which generally range from year to years, and record it as either an increase (in the case of below-market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income. We amortize the amount allocated to the values associated with in-place leases over the expected term of the associated lease, which generally ranges from year to years. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off. Origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease and tenant improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or useful life of the improvement (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). When allocating the purchase price of real estate, we assess fair value of the leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. To the extent acquired leases contain fixed rate renewal options that are below-market and determined to be material, we amortize such below-market lease value into rental income over the renewal period. 
 The Company classifies those leases under which the Company is the lessee at lease commencement as finance or operating leases. Leases qualify as finance leases if the lease transfers ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term, the lease grants an option to purchase the asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the asset, or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. Leases that do not qualify as finance leases are deemed to be operating leases. At lease commencement the Company records a lease liability which is measured as the present value of the lease payments and a right of use asset which is measured as the amount of the lease liability and any initial direct costs incurred. The Company applies a discount rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. If the rate implicit in the lease is known, the Company uses that rate. If the rate implicit in the lease is not known, the Company uses a discount rate reflective of the Company s collateralized borrowing rate given the term of the lease. To determine the discount rate, the Company employs a third-party specialist to develop an analysis based primarily on the observable borrowing rates of the Company, other REITs, and other corporate borrowers with long-term borrowings. On the consolidated statements of operations, operating leases are expensed through operating lease rent while financing leases are expensed through amortization and interest expense. When applicable, the Company combines the consideration for lease and non-lease components in the calculation of the value of the lease obligation and right-of-use asset. 
 On a quarterly basis, or when events or changes in circumstances arise, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate consolidated properties may be impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A consolidated property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) and terminal value to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property as calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 820. We also evaluate our real estate consolidated properties for impairment when a property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation expense is no longer recorded. 
 In April 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the property at 719 Seventh Avenue for million. As a result of the pending sale, the Company recorded a million charge to reduce the carrying value of its investment to the contracted purchase price for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which is included in Depreciable real estate reserves and impairments in the consolidated statements of operations. The transaction closed during the second quarter of 2024. See Note 4, "Properties Held for Sale and Property Dispositions." 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a million charge, reflective of million of capitalized interest, to reduce the carrying value of the residential condominium units at 760 Madison Avenue, based on the total of the sales contracts that the Company entered into for these units. This charge is included in Depreciable real estate reserves and impairments in the consolidated statements of operations. The transactions are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Total investment in marketable securities 
 The cost basis of the commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These securities mature at various times through 2030. As of September 30, 2024, security was in an unrealized gain position of million with a fair market value of million, and securities were in an unrealized loss position of million with a fair market value of million with of the securities being in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. All securities were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023 with an unrealized loss of million, a fair market value of million and were in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. We do not intend to sell our other securities, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. 
 We did t dispose of any debt marketable securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 We held equity marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 We have elected to record the associated interest income and interest expense for these investments as separate line items on our consolidated statements of operations. The amounts recorded in Interest income from real estate loans held by consolidated securitization vehicles on our consolidated statements of operations include the Company's interest income as well as the interest income associated with CMBS positions owned by third parties, which is offset by the amounts recorded in Interest expense on senior obligations of consolidated securitization vehicles on our consolidated statements of operations. As a result, the net impact is limited to the interest income on the CMBS securities we own directly and not the gross consolidated interest income and interest expense.

Interest income recognition is resumed on any debt or preferred equity investment that is on non-accrual status when such debt or preferred equity investment becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. 
 We may syndicate a portion of the loans that we originate or sell the loans individually. When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the loan sold. Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income. 
 Asset management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the asset management agreement.

 SUMMIT is held in a TRS and pays Federal, state and local taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded Federal, state and local tax benefits for SUMMIT of million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded Federal, state and local tax expense for SUMMIT of million and million, respectively. 
 We follow a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions is prohibited. 
 The properties in our real estate portfolio are located in the New York metropolitan area, principally in Manhattan. Our tenants operate in various industries. Other than tenant, Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS Inc.), which accounted for of our share of annualized cash rent as of September 30, 2024, no other tenant in our portfolio accounted for more than of our share of annualized cash rent, including our share of joint venture annualized cash rent, for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 general and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and Series I Preferred Units. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are denominated as common units of limited partnership interest (also referred to as OP Units or preferred units of limited partnership interest (also referred to as Preferred Units ). All references to OP Units and Preferred Units outstanding exclude such units held by the Company. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating Partnership must redeem such OP Unit in exchange for the cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company, except that the Company may, at its election, in lieu of cash redemption, acquire such OP Unit for share of common stock. Because the number of shares of common stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that the Company owns, share of common stock is generally the economic equivalent of OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of common stock. Each series of Preferred Units makes a distribution that is set in accordance with an amendment to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Preferred Units may also be convertible into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof or the Company, subject to the terms of such Preferred Units. 
 Net income (loss) allocated to the preferred unitholders and common unitholders reflects their pro rata share of net income (loss) and distributions.

 fungible units may be granted under the 2005 Plan. Currently, different types of awards count against the limit on the number of fungible units differently, with (1) full-value awards (i.e., those that deliver the full value of the award upon vesting, such as restricted stock) counting as Fungible Units per share subject to such awards, (2) stock options, stock appreciation rights and other awards that do not deliver full value and expire from the date of grant counting as fungible units per share subject to such awards, and (3) all other awards (e.g., -year stock options) counting as fungible units per share subject to such awards. Awards granted under the 2005 Plan prior to the approval of the fifth amendment and restatement in June 2022 continue to count against the fungible unit limit based on the ratios that were in effect at the time such awards were granted, which may be different than the current ratios. As a result, depending on the types of awards issued, the 2005 Plan may result in the issuance of more or less than shares. If a stock option or other award granted under the 2005 Plan expires or terminates, the common stock subject to any portion of the award that expires or terminates without having been exercised or paid, as the case may be, will again become available for the issuance of additional awards. Shares of our common stock distributed under the 2005 Plan may be treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares. Currently, unless the 2005 Plan has been previously terminated by the Company's Board of Directors, new awards may be granted under the 2005 Plan until June 1, 2032, which is the tenth anniversary of the date that the 2005 Plan was most recently approved by the Company's stockholders.

We have also granted Class O LTIP Units, which are a class of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership structured to provide economics similar to those of stock options. Class O LTIP Units, once vested, may be converted, at the election of the holder, into a number of common units of the Operating Partnership per Class O LTIP Unit determined by the increase in value of a share of the Company s common stock at the time of conversion over a participation threshold, which equals the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock at the time of grant. Class O LTIP Units are entitled to distributions, subject to vesting, equal per unit to of the per unit distributions paid with respect to the common units of the Operating Partnership. 
 The fair value of each stock option or LTIP Unit granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on historical information. There were options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023.

 interest in the 10 East 53rd Street joint venture. As a result of the contract terms, it was concluded that the joint venture is a VIE in which the Company is the primary beneficiary, and the investment was consolidated in our financial statements. Upon consolidating the entity, the assets and liabilities of the entity were recorded at fair value which resulted in the recognition of a fair value adjustment of million), which is included in Purchase price and other fair value adjustments in the consolidated statements of operations. This fair value was determined using a third-party valuation which primarily utilized cash flow projections that apply, among other things, estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, as well as the sales comparison approach, which utilizes comparable sales, listings, and sales contracts. All of which are classified as Level 3 inputs. 
 Marketable securities classified as Level 1 are derived from quoted prices in active markets. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of marketable securities classified as Level 2 were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using the significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. 
 The fair value of derivative instruments is based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well-recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions, which are classified as Level 2 inputs. 
 The senior obligations of consolidated securitization vehicles represent CMBS that are not owned by the Company. A majority of these securities are either traded in the marketplace or are similar to other securities that are traded in the marketplace. As the valuation of these amounts are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, we generally utilize third party pricing service providers to determine the fair value. The Company evaluates and assesses the third party pricing by referring to recent trades of similar securities, ratings, subordination levels, current market data and credit issues. The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs and uses the value of the senior obligations of consolidated securitization vehicles as an indicator of the fair value of the real estate loans held by consolidated securitization vehicles. Depending on the significance of the fair value inputs used in determining the fair value, these securities are classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As such, these investments may move between Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy if the significant fair value inputs used to price the CMBS become or cease to be observable. 
 The fair value of our secured borrowing is determined by projecting future cash flows, which takes into consideration various factors including discount rate and exit capitalization rate, as well as related asset performance and local or macro real estate performance. The inputs used in determining the Company's secured borrowing are considered Level 3. 
 The financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, debt and preferred equity investments, mortgages and other loans payable and other secured and unsecured debt. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses reported in our consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of debt and preferred equity investments, which is classified as Level 3, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. The fair value of borrowings, which is classified as Level 3, is estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows of each debt instrument to their present value using adjusted market interest rates, which is provided by a third-party specialist.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not required to post any collateral related to these agreements and was not in breach of any agreement provisions.

We estimate that million) of the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into interest expense and million of the portion related to our share of joint venture accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into equity in net loss from unconsolidated joint ventures within the next 12 months.)

As such, prior period segment data has been restated to reflect SUMMIT as a reportable segment for comparative purposes. 
 We evaluate real estate performance and allocate resources based on earnings contributions. 
 The primary sources of revenue are generated from tenant rents, escalations and reimbursement revenue. Real estate property operating expenses consist primarily of security, maintenance, utility costs, insurance, real estate taxes and, at certain properties, ground rent expense. See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments," for additional details on our debt and preferred equity investments. SUMMIT currently operates one location at One Vanderbilt Avenue in midtown Manhattan with the primary source of revenue generated from ticket sales.

 We allocate loan loss reserves, net of recoveries, and transaction related costs to the debt and preferred equity segment. We do not allocate marketing, general and administrative expenses to the debt and preferred equity segment because that segment does not have dedicated personnel and the use of personnel and resources is dependent on transaction volume between the segments, which varies between periods. In addition, we base performance on the individual segments prior to allocating marketing, general and administrative expenses. SUMMIT segment incurs its own marketing, general and administrative expenses for its dedicated personnel, which are included in SUMMIT Operator expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, marketing, general and administrative expenses totaled million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, marketing, general and administrative expenses totaled million and million, respectively. All other expenses, except interest and SUMMIT operator expenses, relate entirely to the real estate assets. 
 There were no transactions between the above segments other than the SUMMIT lease with our One Vanderbilt Avenue joint venture, which is part of the real estate segment. See Note 10, "Related Party Transactions."

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We currently expect that the principal sources of funds to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for working capital, acquisitions, development or redevelopment of properties, tenant improvements, leasing costs, share repurchase, dividends to shareholders, distributions to unitholders, repurchases or repayments of outstanding indebtedness, and for debt and preferred equity investments will include: 
 (1) Cash flow from operations; 
 (2) Cash on hand; 
 (3) Net proceeds from divestitures of properties and redemptions, participations, dispositions and repayments of debt and preferred equity investments; 
 (4) Borrowings under the revolving credit facility; 
 (5) Other forms of secured or unsecured financing; and 
 (6) Proceeds from common or preferred equity or debt offerings by the Company or the Operating Partnership (including issuances of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and Trust preferred securities). 
 Cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon the collectability of rent, the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs. Additionally, we believe that our debt and preferred equity investment program will continue to serve as a source of operating cash flow. 
 The combined aggregate principal maturities of mortgages and other loans payable, the 2021 credit facility, senior unsecured notes (net of discount), trust preferred securities, our share of joint venture debt, including as-of-right extension options, estimated interest expense, and our obligations under our financing and operating leases, as of September 30, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):

In addition, we expect to incur 26.1 million of development or redevelopment expenditures on existing consolidated properties, none of which will be funded by construction financing facilities or loan reserves. We expect our share of capital expenditures at our joint venture properties will be 68.5 million, of which 57.2 million will be funded by construction financing facilities or loan reserves. We expect to fund capital expenditures from operating cash flow, existing liquidity, and borrowings from construction financing facilities. Future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs.

As of September 30, 2024, we had liquidity of 0.7 billion, comprised of 507.5 million of availability under our revolving credit facility and 204.7 million of consolidated cash on hand, inclusive of 16.5 million of marketable securities. This liquidity excludes 156.1 million representing our share of cash at unconsolidated joint venture properties. We may seek to divest of properties, interests in properties or debt and preferred equity investments or access private and public debt and equity capital when the opportunity presents itself, although there is no guarantee that this capital will be made available to us at efficient levels or at all. Management believes that these sources of liquidity, if we are able to access them, along with potential refinancing opportunities for secured and unsecured debt, will allow us to satisfy our debt and other obligations, as described above, upon maturity, if not before. 
 We have investments in several real estate joint ventures with various partners who are generally considered to be financially stable. Most of our joint ventures are financed with non-recourse debt. We believe that property level cash flows along with unfunded committed indebtedness and proceeds from the refinancing of outstanding secured indebtedness will be sufficient to fund the capital needs of our joint venture properties. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on our consolidated statements of cash flows in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 
 Cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents were 315.1 million and 309.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 5.8 million. The decrease was a result of the following changes in cash flows (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Decrease) Increase Net cash provided by operating activities 71,420 181,338 (109,918) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (37,475) 271,684 (309,159) Net cash used in financing activities (54,339) (527,753) 473,414 
 Our principal sources of operating cash flow are the properties in our consolidated and joint venture portfolios, third-party fees and our debt and preferred equity portfolio. These sources generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund dividend and distribution requirements. 
 Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used cash primarily for the following investing activities (in thousands): 
 Capital expenditures and capitalized interest 31,344 Acquisition deposits and deferred purchase price (12,817) Joint venture investments (252,426) Distributions from joint ventures (9,577) Proceeds from sales of real estate/partial interest in property (69,454) Debt and preferred equity and other investments 3,771 Increase in net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (309,159) 
 Funds spent on capital expenditures, which are comprised of building and tenant improvements, decreased from 194.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 162.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to decreased spending on development and redevelopment properties. 
 We generally fund our investment activity through the sale of real estate, the sale or repayment of debt and preferred equity investments, property-level financing, our corporate credit facilities, or construction facilities. From time to time, the Company may issue common or preferred stock or equity-linked securities, or the Operating Partnership may issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest.

 The table below summarizes our consolidated mortgages and other loans payable, 2021 credit facility, 2022 term loan, senior unsecured notes and trust preferred securities outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, (amounts in thousands). 
 Debt Summary: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Balance Fixed rate 1,112,898 1,117,386 Variable rate hedged 2,175,000 2,120,000 Total fixed rate 3,287,898 3,237,386 Total variable rate 545,900 270,000 Total debt 3,833,798 3,507,386 Debt, preferred equity, and other investments subject to variable rate 109,450 168,745 Net exposure to variable rate debt 436,450 101,255 Percent of Total Debt :

 (1) Inclusive of the mitigating effect of our debt, preferred equity, and other investments subject to variable rates, the percent of total debt of our net exposure to variable rate debt was 11.7 and 3.0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The variable rate debt shown above generally bears interest at an interest rate based on adjusted Term SOFR (4.85 and 5.35 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively). Our consolidated debt as of September 30, 2024 had a weighted average term to maturity of 1.88 years. 
 Certain of our debt and equity investments and other investments, with carrying values of 109.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and 168.7 million as of December 31, 2023, are variable rate investments which mitigate our exposure to interest rate changes on our unhedged variable rate debt. Inclusive of the mitigating effect of these investments, the net ratio of our consolidated variable rate debt to total debt was 11.7 and 3.0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Corporate Indebtedness 
 2021 Credit Facility 
 In December 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit facility, referred to as the 2021 credit facility, that was previously amended by the Company in November 2017, and was originally entered into by the Company in November 2012. As of September 30, 2024, the 2021 credit facility consisted of a 1.25 billion revolving credit facility, a 1.05 billion term loan (or "Term Loan A"), and a 200.0 million term loan (or "Term Loan B") with maturity dates of May 15, 2026, May 15, 2027, and November 21, 2024, respectively. The revolving credit facility has two six-month, as-of-right extension options to May 15, 2027. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity of the credit facility to 4.5 billion at any time prior to the maturity dates for the revolving credit facility and term loans without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2021 credit facility bore interest at a spread over adjusted Term SOFR plus 10 basis points with an interest period of one or three months, as we may elect, ranging from (i) 72.5 basis points to 140 basis points for loans under the revolving credit facility, (ii) 80 basis points to 160 basis points for loans under Term Loan A, and (iii) 85 basis points to 165 basis points for loans under Term Loan B, in each case based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of the Company. In instances where there are either only two ratings available or where there are more than two and the difference between them is one rating category, the applicable rating shall be the highest rating. In instances where 
 75 

Table of Contents 

there are more than two ratings and the difference between the highest and the lowest is two or more rating categories, then the applicable rating used is the average of the highest two, rounded down if the average is not a recognized category. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the applicable spread over adjusted Term SOFR plus 10 basis points for the 2021 credit facility was 140 basis points for the revolving credit facility, 160 basis points for Term Loan A, and 165 basis points for Term Loan B. We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a 12.5 to 30 basis point facility fee on the total commitments under the revolving credit facility based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the facility fee was 30 basis points. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 7.5 million of outstanding letters of credit, 735.0 million drawn under the revolving credit facility and 1.25 billion of outstanding term loans, with total undrawn capacity of 507.5 million under the 2021 credit facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the revolving credit facility had a carrying value of 730.9 million and 554.8 million, respectively, net of deferred financing costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the term loans had a carrying value of 1.2 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively, net of deferred financing costs. 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership are borrowers jointly and severally obligated under the 2021 credit facility. 
 The 2021 credit facility includes certain restrictions and covenants (see Restrictive Covenants below). 
 Restrictive Covenants 
 The terms of the 2021 credit facility and our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, make certain types of investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and dispose of assets, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value. The dividend restriction referred to above provides that we will not, during any time when a default is continuing, make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests, except to enable the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate debt. Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations are managed through the use of interest rate derivative instruments and through our variable rate debt and preferred equity investments. As of September 30, 2024, 3.3 billion of our consolidated long-term debt and 6.1 billion of our share of joint venture long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates. Our variable rate debt and variable rate joint venture debt as of September 30, 2024 bore interest based on a spread to LIBOR of 145 basis points and Term SOFR of 50 basis points to 677 basis points. Based on the debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the applicable floating interest rate curve would increase our consolidated annual interest cost, net of interest income from variable rate debt and preferred equity investments, by 4.1 million and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by 15.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, 0.1 billion of our debt and preferred equity portfolio was indexed to SOFR. 
 We recognize most derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is considered a hedge for accounting purposes, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have off-balance sheet investments, including joint ventures and debt and preferred equity investments. These investments all have varying ownership structures. A majority of our joint venture arrangements are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial decisions of these joint venture arrangements. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments" and Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Dividends/Distributions 
 We expect to pay dividends to our stockholders based on the distributions we receive from our Operating Partnership. 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined before taking into consideration the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains. 
 76 

Table of Contents 

Any dividend we pay may be in the form of cash, stock or a combination thereof, subject to IRS limitations on the use of stock for dividends. Additionally, if our REIT taxable income in a particular year exceeds the amount of cash dividends we pay in that year, we may pay stock dividends in order to maintain our REIT status and avoid certain REIT-level taxes. 
 Before we pay any cash dividend, whether for Federal income tax purposes or otherwise, which would only be paid out of available cash to the extent permitted under the 2021 credit facility and senior unsecured notes, we must first meet both our operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our mortgages and loans payable. 
 
 Insurance 
 We maintain all-risk property and rental value coverage (including coverage regarding the perils of flood, earthquake and terrorism, excluding nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological terrorism ("NBCR")), within two property insurance programs and liability insurance. Separate property and liability coverage may be purchased on a stand-alone basis for certain assets, such as development projects. Additionally, one of our captive insurance companies, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, provides coverage for NBCR terrorist acts above a specified trigger. Belmont's retention is reinsured by our other captive insurance company, Ticonderoga Insurance Company ("Ticonderoga"). If Belmont or Ticonderoga are required to pay a claim under our insurance policies, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of required payments. However, there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost. Further, if we experience losses that are uninsured or that exceed policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. Additionally, our debt instruments contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance and we could default under our debt instruments if the cost and/or availability of certain types of insurance make it impractical or impossible to comply with such covenants relating to insurance. Belmont and Ticonderoga provide coverage solely on properties owned by the Company or its affiliates. 
 Furthermore, with respect to certain of our properties, including properties held by joint ventures or subject to triple net leases, insurance coverage is obtained by a third-party and we do not control the coverage. While we may have agreements with such third parties to maintain adequate coverage and we monitor these policies, such coverage ultimately may not be maintained or adequately cover our risk of loss. 
 
 Funds from Operations 
 FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended in December 2018, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 The Company presents FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the Company s operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. The Company also uses FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based compensation for members of its senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions, and real estate related impairment charges, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company s liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company s cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 SL GREEN REALTY CORP. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Also, the Company has investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As the Company does not control these entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those the Company maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances to the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information relating to the Company that would potentially be subject to disclosure under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no significant changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
