 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events, or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes, or anticipates will or may occur in the future and include statements related to the proposed spin-off of the Company's Advanced Materials business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company. They are based on management s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments, and other relevant factors, many of which are difficult to predict and outside of our control. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments, and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities law. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to material risks and uncertainties, including ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, such as lower GDP growth or recession, supply chain disruptions, capital markets volatility, inflation, and certain regional conflicts, that can affect our performance in both the near- and long-term. In addition, no assurance can be given that any plan, initiative, projection, goal, commitment, expectation, or prospect set forth in this Form 10-Q can or will be achieved. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, without limitation, the Risk Factors, as well as the description of trends and other factors in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, set forth in this report and our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Certain repositioning projects will recognize exit costs in future periods when the actual liability is incurred. Such exit costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were million and million, respectively. 
 OTHER CHARGES 
 In 2022, the Company recognized million of Other charges related to the initial suspension and the wind down of the Company's business and operations in Russia. These costs impacted all reportable business segments, with the most significant impact within the historical Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment. The Other charges include costs recorded in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expenses, or Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized Other charges of million related to the settle ment of a contractual dispute with a Russian entity associated with the Company's suspension and wind down activities in Russia. The charges were recorded in Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Given the uncertainty inherent in the Company's remaining obligations related to contracts with Russian counterparties, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Based on available information to date, the Company s estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to the wind down of activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to the Company's wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized but would not be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of estimate for contingencies. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a fair value adjustment, within Asbestos-related charges, net of insurance and reimbursements in the table above and Other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, related to HWI Net Sale Proceeds (as defined in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies) and reduced the estimate by million. See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.

 Other liabilities Total environmental liabilities 
 The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation, or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, although they could be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering the Company's past experience and existing reserves, the Company does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position. 
 In conjunction with the Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo) spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideo s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to of Honeywell s annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation is less than million. 
 Reimbursements associated with this agreement are collected from Resideo quarterly and were million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company incurs costs for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimburse ment agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for of such costs is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was million. As of September 30, 2024, Other current assets and Other assets included million and million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agree ment.

 NARCO Products NARCO manufactured high-grade, heat-resistant, refractory products for various industries. Honeywell s predecessor, Allied Corporation, owned NARCO from 1979 to 1986. Allied Corporation sold the NARCO business in 1986 and entered into a cross-indemnity agreement which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims, arising primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980 and filed for bankruptcy in January 2002, at which point in time all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO. The Company established its initial liability for NARCO asbestos claims in 2002. 
 NARCO emerged from bankruptcy in April 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established to evaluate and resolve all existing NARCO asbestos claims (the Trust). Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos-related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the Trust (Channeling Injunction). The NARCO Trust Agreement (TA) and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (TDP) set forth the structure and operating rules of the Trust, and established Honeywell s evergreen funding obligations. 
 The operating rules per the TDP define criteria claimants must meet for a claim to be considered valid and paid. Once operational in 2014, the Trust began to receive, process, and pay claims. In September 2021, Honeywell filed suit against the Trust in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (Bankruptcy Court) alleging that the Trust breached its duties in managing the Trust, including breaches of certain provisions of the TA and TDP. Honeywell's lawsuit sought appropriate relief preventing the Trust from continuing these practices. The Trust also filed suit against Honeywell, alleging Honeywell breached its obligations under the Trust's governing documents. Honeywell moved to dismiss the Trust s suit, and on December 15, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court granted Honeywell s motion to dismiss subject to granting the Trust leave to file an amended complaint. On December 28, 2021, the Trust filed an answer with counterclaims in response to Honeywell s complaint and in lieu of filing an amended complaint. The Bankruptcy Court conducted a trial on these matters during May 2022; following the trial, the Company and the Trust began discussing a potential settlement of Honeywell s remaining obligations to the Trust. 
 On November 18, 2022, Honeywell entered into a definitive agreement (Buyout Agreement) with the Trust, and on November 20, 2022, in exchange for the NARCO Trust Advisory Committee (TAC) and Lawrence Fitzpatrick, in his capacity as the NARCO Asbestos Future Claimants Representative (FCR), becoming parties to the Buyout Agreement, Honeywell, the Trust, the TAC, and the FCR entered into an Amended and Restated Buyout Agreement (Amended Buyout Agreement). 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Buyout Agreement, Honeywell agreed to make a one-time, lump sum payment in the amount of billion to the Trust (Buyout Amount), subject to certain deductions as described in the Amended Buyout Agreement and in exchange for the release by the Trust of Honeywell from all further and future obligations of any kind related to the Trust and/or any claimants who were exposed to asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold, or distributed by NARCO or its predecessors, including Honeywell s ongoing evergreen obligation to fund (i) claims against the Trust, which comprise Honeywell s NARCO asbestos-related claims liability, and (ii) the Trust s annual operating expenses, which are expensed as incurred, including its legal fees (which operating expenses, for reference, were approximately million in 2022) (such evergreen obligations referred to in (i) and (ii), Honeywell Obligations) (the NARCO Buyout). 
 On December 8, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order that (A) approved the Amended Buyout Agreement, and (B) declared that the NARCO Channeling Injunction (which bars all past, present, and future individual actions in state or federal courts based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products and requires all such claims to be made against the Trust) will remain in full force and effect without modification, dissolution, or termination (Order). 
 On December 14, 2022, HWI, the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged from the NARCO bankruptcy, entered into a definitive agreement (Sale Agreement) pursuant to which an affiliate of Platinum Equity, LLC agreed to acquire HWI (HWI Sale) subject to the terms set forth in the Sale Agreement, including customary conditions to closing set forth therein. In accordance with the Amended Buyout Agreement, the economic rights of the Trust in respect of the net proceeds from the HWI Sale inure to the benefit of Honeywell.

 million from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognized a charge of billion in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and accrued a corresponding liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Buyout Amount. In addition, the Company recognized a benefit of million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and corresponding asset in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for Honeywell's rights to the proceeds from the HWI Sale. The benefit of million offset the charge for the Buyout Amount. 
 On February 16, 2023, the HWI Sale closed. Pursuant to the Amended Buyout Agreement, during 2023, Honeywell received million of proceeds from the HWI Sale (HWI Net Sale Proceeds) . Additionally, during 2023, the Company recorded a fair value adjustment for the HWI Net Sale Proceeds and reduced the HWI Net Sale Proceeds estimate by million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Honeywell received million of proceeds from the HWI Sale. The ending balance as of September 30, 2024, was million. The fair value of the remaining HWI Net Sale Proceeds as of September 30, 2024, represents contingent consideration to be paid in future periods if certain conditions under the definitive sale agreement for the HWI Sale are met. 
 Bendix Products Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements.

 The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims, which exclude the Company s ongoing legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed as they are incurred. 
 The Company reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system over a defined look-back period. The Company historically valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using a five-year look-back period. The Company reviews the valuation assumptions and average resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year.

This amount includes million attributable primarily to shortening the look-back period to the two most recent years, and to a lesser extent to increasing expected resolution values for a subset of asserted claims to adjust for higher claim values in that subset than in the modelled two-year data set. 
 The Company's insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on the Company's ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on the Company's analysis of the underlying insurance policies, historical experience with insurers, ongoing review of the solvency of insurers, judicial determinations relevant to insurance programs, and consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with the Company's insurers. 
 SEC MATTER 
 The Company is cooperating with a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which is primarily focused on certain accounting matters with respect to the Company's former Performance Materials and Technologies segment. At this time, the Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. 
 PETROBRAS AND UNAOIL MATTERS 
 On December 19, 2022, the Company reached a comprehensive resolution to the investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, and certain Brazilian authorities (Brazilian Authorities) relating to the Company's use of third parties who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to a project awarded in 2010 for Petr leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras). The investigations focused on the Company s compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar Brazilian laws (UOP Matters). The comprehensive resolution also resolves DOJ and SEC investigations relating to a matter involving a foreign subsidiary s prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011 (the Unaoil Matter). 
 In connection with the comprehensive resolution, (i) the Company agreed to pay a total equivalent of million, which payment occurred in January 2023, to the DOJ, the SEC, and the Brazilian Authorities, collectively, in penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest, (ii) the Company s subsidiary, UOP, LLC (UOP), entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the DOJ for charges related to the UOP Matters, (iii) UOP entered into leniency agreements with the Brazilian authorities related to the UOP Matter in Brazil, and (iv) the Company entered into an agreement with the SEC that resolves allegations relating to the UOP Matters and the Unaoil Matter. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company agreed to undertake certain compliance measures and compliance reporting obligations. These agreements entirely resolved the Petrobras and Unaoil investigations. 
 OTHER MATTERS 
 The Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health, and safety matters. The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.

 reportable business segments. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions, and assesses operating performance. 
 Effective during the first quarter of 2024, the Company realigned certain of its business units comprising its historical Performance Materials and Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segments by forming new reportable business segments: Industrial Automation and Energy and Sustainability Solutions. Industrial Automation includes Sensing and Safety Technologies, Productivity Solutions and Services, and Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, previously included in Safety and Productivity Solutions, in addition to Process Solutions, previously included in Performance Materials and Technologies. Energy and Sustainability Solutions includes UOP and Advanced Materials, previously included in Performance Materials and Technologies. Further, as part of the realignment, the Company renamed its historical Aerospace and Honeywell Building Technologies reportable business segments to Aerospace Technologies and Building Automation, respectively. This realignment had no impact on the Company s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to current period segment presentation. 
 Effective during the second quarter of 2024, the Company updated its calculation of segment profit to exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and certain acquisition-related costs. The Company recast historical periods to reflect segment profit under this new basis to facilitate comparability. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company clarified its calculation of segment profit to exclude divestiture-related costs and impairments. 
 Honeywell s senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Each segment s profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes and excluding general corporate unallocated expense, interest and other financial charges, interest income, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, impairment of assets held for sale, stock compensation expense, pension ongoing and other postretirement income (expense), repositioning and other charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related charges, and other items within Other (income) expense.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (Dollars in tables and graphs in millions, except per share amounts) 
 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell, we, us, our, or the Company) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The financial information as of September 30, 2024, should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, contained in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 3 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Certain prior year amounts are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
 
 BUSINESS UPDATE 
 MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 We continue to monitor the impacts of ongoing macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events. Global conflicts, tariffs, labor disruptions, and regulations continue to create volatility in global markets and contribute to supply chain shortages and pricing volatility. Inflationary pressures from earlier tariffs and sanctions are subsiding but the risk of supplier price volatility remains. We continue to actively collaborate with our suppliers to minimize shortages and reduce supply and price volatility. Slowing global growth has temporarily alleviated pressure on logistics, freight, and service capacities. 
 Our mitigation strategies include pricing actions and hedging strategies, longer term planning for constrained materials, new supplier development, material supply tracking tools, and direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand. Our relationships with primary and secondary suppliers allow us to reliably source key components and raw materials, which include considering altering existing products, developing new products, and committing our own resources to assist certain suppliers. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, accelerate new product innovation, and expand our penetration in the markets we serve. Additionally, due to the strenuous quality controls and product qualification we perform on a new or altered product, we do not expect these mitigation strategies to impact product quality or reliability. 
 To date, our strategies have successfully mitigated our exposure to these conditions. However, if we are not successful in sustaining or executing these strategies, these macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows. 
 SPIN-OFF OF ADVANCED MATERIALS 
 On October 8, 2024, the Company announced its intention to spin off its Advanced Materials business into an independent, U.S. publicly traded company, which is targeted to be completed by the end of 2025 or early 2026.The planned spin-off is intended to be a tax-free spin to Honeywell shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, finalization of the financial statements of the Advanced Materials business, the filing and effectiveness of applicable filings (including a Form 10 registration statement) with the SEC, assurance that the spin-off of the Advanced Materials business will be tax-free to Honeywell s shareowners, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and final approval by Honeywell s Board of Directors. The proposed spin-off is complex in nature, and may be affected by unanticipated developments, credit and equity markets or changes in market conditions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 (Dollars in tables in millions) 
 We manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. Each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover. Additional sources of liquidity include U.S. cash balances, and the ability to access non-U.S. cash balances, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, committed credit lines, and access to the public debt and equity markets. 
 
 CASH 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we held 10.9 billion and 8.1 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, including our short-term investments. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one counterparty. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 6.8 billion of the Company s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. We do not have material amounts related to any jurisdiction subject to currency control restrictions that impact our ability to access and repatriate such amounts. Under current laws, we do not expect taxes on repatriation or restrictions on amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity. 
 
 CASH FLOW SUMMARY 
 Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows:

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 1,431 million, primarily due to the 1,325 million payment made by the Company pursuant to the NARCO Amended Buyout Agreement in 2023. 
 Net cash used for investing activities increased by 7,448 million, driven by a 6,331 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions, 538 million net increase in investments, and 462 million net increase in cash payments from settlements of derivative contracts. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 10,485 million, driven by a 7,422 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, primarily to fund recent acquisitions, 1,796 million increase in net proceeds of commercial paper, and 987 million decrease in repurchases of common stock. 
 
 CASH REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LIQUIDITY 
 In addition to our operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will include funding capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions, and debt repayments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased common stock of 1.2 billion. Refer to the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources of our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of our expected capital expenditures, share repurchases, mergers and acquisitions activity, and dividends for 2024. 
 We continually seek opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers and transfer of our trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions on a true sale basis. The impact of these programs is not material to our overall liquidity. 
 We continue to assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit, and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. We identify acquisition candidates that are expected to further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired Access Solutions for total consideration of 4.9 billion, net of cash acquired, CAES Systems Holdings LLC for total consideration of 1.9 billion, net of cash acquired, and Civitanavi Systems S.p.A. for total consideration of 200 million, net of cash acquired. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we acquired Air Products' liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business for 1.8 billion, net of cash acquired. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability, or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring, or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints. During the third quarter of 2024, we classified the assets and liabilities of the personal protective equipment business as held for sale. See Note 3 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. In addition, on October 8, 2024, we announced our intention to spin off the Advanced Materials business into an independent, U.S. publicly traded company, which is targeted to be completed by the end of 2025 or early 2026. 
 In early 2023, we made payments of approximately 1.5 billion in connection with the NARCO Buyout and UOP Matters. Pursuant to the NARCO Amended Buyout Agreement, we received proceeds of 275 million from the HWI Sale during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 3 million of proceeds from the HWI Sale and may receive additional consideration in future periods if certain conditions under the definitive sale agreement for the HWI Sale are met. These payments and receipts have not materially impacted our liquidity position. See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion related to the fair value of future proceeds from the HWI Sale. 
 Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by financing activities included proceeds of 10.4 billion from the issuance of long-term debt primarily to fund the Access Solutions, Civitanavi Systems S.p.A., CAES, and LNG acquisitions. 
 See Note 9 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity.

 BORROWINGS 
 We leverage a variety of debt instruments to manage our overall borrowing costs. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our total borrowings were 30.8 billion and 20.4 billion, respectively. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial paper 3,134 2,083 Variable rate notes 22 22 Fixed rate notes 26,651 18,530 Term loan 1,000 Other 421 219 Fair value of hedging instruments (89) (166) Debt issuance costs (310) (245) Total borrowings 30,829 20,443 
 A primary source of liquidity is our ability to access the corporate bond markets. Through these markets, we issue a variety of long-term fixed rate notes, in a variety of currencies, to manage our overall funding costs. 
 Another primary source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of 365 days or less from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. 
 We also have the following loan and revolving credit agreements: 
 A 1.0 billion Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated as of August 12, 2024. Amounts borrowed under the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than August 12, 2027, unless the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
 A 1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated as of March 18, 2024. Amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 17, 2025, unless (i) we elect to convert all then outstanding amounts into a term loan, upon which such amounts shall be repaid in full on March 17, 2026, or (ii) the 364-Day Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the previously reported 1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement dated as of March 20, 2023, which was terminated in accordance with its terms effective March 18, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-Day Credit Agreement. 
 A 4.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated as of March 18, 2024. Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed 4.5 billion. The 5-Year Credit Agreement amended and restated the previously reported 4.0 billion amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated as of March 20, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 5-Year Credit Agreement. 
 See Note 9 Long-Term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt instruments. 
 
 CREDIT RATINGS 
 Our ability to access the global debt capital markets and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of September 30, 2024, S P Global Inc. (S P), Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch), and Moody s Investor Service (Moody's) have ratings on our debt set forth in the table below:

 LITIGATION

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Other than as noted below, there have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates presented in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the Company s Critical Accounting Estimates, see the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing The Company s business combinations typically result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The Company generally engages an independent third-party valuation specialist for assistance in the allocation of the purchase price and determination of the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, which involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions based on information available at or near the acquisition date. The Company believes the accounting estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on information available at the date of acquisition through historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired entity; however, there is inherent uncertainty in the accounting estimates as assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. 
 Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such accounting estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key accounting estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. 
 Definite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company s business combinations typically result in the recognition of customer relationships, patents, and trademarks, in addition to other definite-lived intangible assets. The determination of fair value for definite-lived intangible assets, useful lives (for depreciation / amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. The assumptions used in developing the accounting estimates may include business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. 
 We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a definite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: 
 Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; 
 Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicates an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; 
 Significant negative industry or economic trends; or 
 Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. 
 Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is then measured as the excess, if any, of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. 
 The fair value estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variances from assumptions could materially affect the valuations.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Other than as noted below, there have been no material changes to our Risk Factors presented in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the section titled Risk Factors. For further discussion of our Risk Factors, refer to the section titled Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The Company is subject to risks related to its plan to spin off its Advanced Materials business into a standalone, publicly traded company. 
 On October 8, 2024, the Company announced its intent to spin off its Advanced Materials business, which is part of its Energy and Sustainability Solutions reportable business segment, into an independent, U.S. publicly traded company, in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free for the Company s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, finalization of the financial statements of the Advanced Materials business, the filing and effectiveness of applicable filings (including a Form 10 registration statement) with the SEC, assurance that the spin-off of the Advanced Materials business will be tax-free to Honeywell s shareowners, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and final approval by Honeywell s Board of Directors. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, as well as additional factors such as conditions in the equity and debt markets, other external conditions, and developments or challenges involving the intended spin-off, the Company or any of its businesses, many of which are outside of the Company s control, could delay the completion of the spin-off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. These or other unanticipated developments could delay or prevent the proposed spin-off or cause the proposed spin-off to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated, including without limitation, the failure to qualify as tax-free to our shareowners (which could result in significant income tax liabilities to the Company and/or its shareholders), and the inability of the spun-off company to incur sufficient indebtedness to allow for a distribution to Honeywell of proceeds concurrently with the consummation of the spin-off. Furthermore, if the spin-off is completed, there is no guarantee that it will be successful in meeting its objectives or achieving its intended benefits. Whether or not the spin-off is ultimately completed, the Company and our business may face challenges as a result of the transaction, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management s time; and potential negative impacts on the Company s relationships with its customers, employees, regulators and other counterparties. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 On April 24, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 billion of Honeywell common stock, including approximately 2.1 billion of remaining availability under the previously announced 10 billion share repurchase authorization. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. 
 57 Honeywell International Inc. 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which could include open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase transactions, negotiated block transactions, 10b5-1 plans, other transactions that may be structured through investment banking institutions or privately negotiated, or a combination of the foregoing. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time (i) to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting, and matching contributions under our savings plans, and (ii) to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing, and other investing activities. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were repurchased by the Company. As of September 30, 2024, 5.9 billion remained available for additional share repurchases. The following table summarizes our purchases of Honeywell's common stock for the three months ended September 30, 2024:
