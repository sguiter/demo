During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received proceeds of million and recognized a net loss of from sales of securities available for sale. The net loss consisted of in gains and of losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale were million and million, respectively, and net gain was inconsequential. The following tables show the Company s gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investment securities with unrealized losses for which an allowance for credit losses ACL has not been recorded, aggregated by investment class and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an ACL for securities available for sale on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both the ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if the Company expects, or is required, to sell an impaired security available for sale before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security s amortized cost basis. Because the security s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is ACL in this situation. In evaluating securities available for sale in unrealized loss positions for impairment and the criteria regarding its intent or requirement to sell such securities, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuers financial condition, among other factors. Unrealized losses on the Company s investment securities portfolio have not been recognized as an expense because the securities are of high credit quality, and the decline in fair values is attributable to changes in the prevailing interest rate environment since the purchase date. Fair value is expected to recover as securities reach maturity and/or the interest rate

 credit related factors underlying unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Securities held to maturity are primarily comprised of non-agency mortgage-backed senior securities secured by multi-family, single-family or healthcare properties, and agency mortgage-backed securities secured by multi-family properties. The agency securities held to maturity are Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Accordingly, allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. The non-agency securities were purchased under securitization arrangements where a credit loss component was purchased by third party investors. Additional qualitative factors are evaluated, including the timeliness of principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Accordingly, allowance for credit losses has been recorded for the non-agency securities. million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company also elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Past-due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. The interest collected on these loans is applied to the principal balance until the loan can be returned to an accrual status, which is no less than six months. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. For all loan portfolio segments, the Company charges off loans, or portions thereof, when available information confirms that specific loans are uncollectable based on information that includes, but is not limited to, (1) the deteriorating financial condition of the borrower, (2) declining collateral values, and/or (3) legal action, including bankruptcy, that impairs the borrower s ability to adequately meet its obligations.

Mortgage Warehouse Repurchase Agreements (MTG WHRA): Under its warehouse program, the Company provides warehouse financing arrangements to approved mortgage companies for their origination and sale of residential mortgage and multi-family loans. Loans secured by mortgages placed on existing one-to-four family dwellings may be originated or purchased and placed through each mortgage warehouse facility. As a secured repurchase agreement, collateral pledged to the Company secures each individual mortgage until the mortgage company sells the loan in the secondary market. A traditional secured warehouse facility typically carries a base interest rate of the Federal Reserve s Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), or mortgage note rate, and a margin.

 of total commercial and commercial real estate loans are made up of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. Agricultural Production and Real Estate Loans (AG AGRE): Agricultural production loans are generally comprised of seasonal operating lines of credit to grain farmers to plant and harvest corn and soybeans and term loans to fund the purchase of equipment. The Company also offers long-term financing to purchase agricultural real estate. Specific underwriting standards have been established for agricultural-related loans including the establishment of projections for each operating year based on industry-developed estimates of farm input costs and expected commodity yields and prices. Operating lines are typically written for one year and secured by the crop and other farm assets as considered necessary. The Company is approved to sell agricultural loans in the secondary market through the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and uses this relationship to manage interest rate risk within the portfolio.

 Loan characteristics used in determining the segmentation include the underlying collateral, type or purpose of the loan, and expected credit loss patterns. The initial estimation of expected credit losses for each segment is based on historical credit loss experience and management s judgement. Given the Company s modest historical credit loss experience, peer and industry data was incorporated into the measurement. Expected life of loan credit losses are quantified using discounted cash flows and remaining life methodologies.

 MF FIN HC FIN CML CRE AG AGRE CON MAR Total collateral dependent loans Internal Risk Categories The Company evaluates the loan risk grading system definitions and ACL-Loans methodology on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2023, the Company created a newly defined special mention risk rating category to be consistent with industry practices. Loans with a Watch classification are now included in the Pass risk rating category as of December 31, 2023. This updated policy was approved by the Company s Management Committee, to be effective as of December 31, 2023 on a prospective basis. In adherence with policy, the Company uses the following internal risk grading categories and definitions for loans as of and subsequent to December 31, 2023: Pass - Loans that are considered to be of acceptable credit quality, and not classified as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful. Also included are loans classified as Watch loans, which represent loans that remain sound and collectible but contain elevated risk that requires management s attention. Special Mention Loans classified as Special Mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Special Mention loans are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification. Loans with questions or concerns regarding collateral, adverse market conditions impacting future performance, and declining financial trends would be considered for Special Mention. Substandard - Loans classified as Substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. When a loan in the form of a line of credit is downgraded to Substandard, it is evaluated for impairment and future draws under the line of credit require the approval of an officer of Senior Credit Officer or above. Doubtful - Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Nonperforming Loans Nonaccrual loans, including modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that have not met the six-month minimum performance criterion, are reported as nonperforming loans. For all loan classes, it is the Company s policy to have any modified loans which are on nonaccrual status prior to being modified, remain on nonaccrual status until six months of satisfactory borrower performance, at which time management would consider its return to accrual status.

 Other real estate owned December 31, 2023 Collateral dependent loans Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below. Collateral Dependent Loans, Net of ACL-Loans The estimated fair value of collateral dependent loans is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell. Collateral dependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company considers the appraisal or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factors and events in the environment that may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral underlying collateral-dependent loans are obtained when the loan is determined to be classified as substandard, collateral-dependent and subsequently as deemed necessary by the Chief Credit Officer s CCO) office. Appraisals and evaluations are reviewed for accuracy and consistency by the CCO s office. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. The appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral. These discounts and estimates are developed by the CCO s office by comparison to historical results. Other Real Estate Owned The estimated fair value of other real estate owned is usually on the appraised fair value of the collateral or in certain circumstances on sales agreements, and in all cases net of estimated cost to sell. Other real estate owned is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company considers the appraisal or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factors and events in the environment that may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral underlying other real estate owned are obtained when the loan is in the process of foreclosure and subsequently as deemed necessary by the Chief Credit Officer s CCO) office. Appraisals and evaluations are reviewed for accuracy and consistency by the CCO s office. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management.

The words the Company, we, our and us refer to Merchants Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless we indicate otherwise. Financial Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Net income of 61.3 million decreased 20.2 million, or 25 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in specific reserves on loans as part of the allowance for credit losses and unfavorable fair market value adjustments to derivatives and servicing rights. Diluted earnings per share of 1.17 decreased 30 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Tangible book value per common share of 32.38 increased 25 compared to 25.82 at September 30, 2023. Total assets of 18.7 billion increased 2 compared to June 30, 2024, and increased 10 compared to December 31, 2023. Loans receivable, net of allowance for credit losses on loans, of 10.3 billion, decreased 671.3 million, or 6 , compared to June 30, 2024, and increased 134.1 million, or 1 , compared to December 31, 2023. In September 2024 the Company sold 629 million of healthcare bridge loans into a private securitization via a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). As part of the transaction, the Company purchased 535 million senior investment security that is classified as held to maturity and carries an 80 lower capital requirement than the bridge loans. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 94 of loans reprice within three months, which reduces the risk of market rate increases. Net interest margin was 2.99 and remain unchanged compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Efficiency ratio was 41.00 compared to 27.97 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 5.1 billion in unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Discount window, based on available collateral. The Company s line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, alone, could fund 120 of uninsured deposits. The Company s most liquid assets are in unrestricted cash, short-term investments, including interest-earning demand deposits, mortgage loans in process of securitization, loans held for sale, and warehouse repurchase agreements included in loans receivable. Taken together, with unused borrowing capacity, these totaled 11.1 billion, or 59 , of the 18.7 billion in total assets as of September 30, 2024.

 The volume of warehouse loans funded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 13.1 billion, an increase of 2.4 billion, or 22 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This compared to the 21 industry increase in single-family residential loan volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the same period in 2023, according to an estimate of industry volume by the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
 Business Overview We are a diversified bank holding company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. We currently operate in multiple business segments, including Multi-family Mortgage Banking that offers multi-family housing and healthcare facility financing and servicing, as well as syndicated low-income housing tax credit and debt funds; Mortgage Warehousing that offers mortgage warehouse financing, commercial loans, and deposit services; and Banking that offers portfolio lending for multi-family and healthcare facility loans, retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking, agricultural lending, Small Business Administration SBA lending, and traditional community banking. Our business consists primarily of funding fixed rate, low risk, multi-family, residential and SBA loans meeting underwriting standards of government programs under an originate to sell model, and retaining adjustable rate loans as held for investment to reduce interest rate risk. The gain on sale of these loans and servicing fees contribute to noninterest income. The funding source is primarily from mortgage custodial, municipal, retail, commercial, and brokered deposits, and short-term borrowing. We believe that the combination of net interest income and noninterest income from the sale of low risk profile assets results in lower than industry charge-offs and a lower expense base which serves to maximize net income and higher than industry shareholder return. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the current circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The estimates and judgments that management believes have the most effect on its reported financial position and results of operations are set forth within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since those reported for the year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Condition As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 18.7 billion in total assets, 12.9 billion in deposits and 1.9 billion in total shareholders equity. Total assets as of September 30, 2024 included approximately 10.3 billion of loans receivable, net of allowance for credit losses on loans ACL-Loans and 3.8 billion of loans held for sale. There were also 1.8 billion in securities classified as held to maturity, most of which were acquired through loan securitizations. Assets also included 953.1 million in securities available for sale, the majority of which were acquired from a warehouse customer through loan securitizations, and others are match funded or required to collateralize our credit-linked notes. Additionally, we had 601.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, 431.0 million of mortgage loans in process of securitization that represent pre-sold multi-family rental real estate loan originations in primarily Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae ), Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae ), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities pending settlements that typically occur within 30 days. Other assets at September 30, 2024 totaled 329.4 million, which primarily represents low-income

 housing tax credits. Servicing rights at September 30, 2024 totaled 177.3 million based on the fair value of the loan servicing, which are primarily Ginnie Mae multi-family servicing rights with 10-year call protection. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Total Assets. Total assets of 18.7 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 1.7 billion, or 10 , compared to 17.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to growth in loans held for sale and in the warehouse and multi-family loan portfolios. There was also an increase in securities held to maturity compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to the purchase of a security representing healthcare loans sold into a securitization in the third quarter of 2024 that was offset by a decline in loans in the healthcare portfolio that were sold into the securitization. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents of 601.9 million at September 30, 2024 increased 17.5 million, or 3 , compared to 584.4 million at December 31, 2023. Included in cash equivalents was 45.7 million in restricted cash associated with the March 2023 issuance of senior credit linked notes described in Note 1: Basis of Presentation and the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K . Mortgage Loans in Process of Securitization. Mortgage loans in process of securitization of 431.0 million at September 30, 2024 increased 320.4 million, or 290 , compared to 110.6 million at December 31, 2023. These represent loans that our banking subsidiary, Merchants Bank, has funded and are held pending settlement, primarily as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities with a firm investor commitment to purchase the securities. The 290 increase was primarily due to a higher origination volume of loans pending settlement date. Securities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale of 953.1 million at September 30, 2024 decreased 160.6 million, or 14 , compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in securities available for sale was primarily due to 662.2 in calls, maturities, repayments, sales and other adjustments, partially offset by purchases of 501.6 million during the period. Included in securities available for sale were 683.0 million of investments for which a fair value option was elected. Fair value option securities represent securities which the Company has elected to carry at fair value and are separately identified on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings as they occur. As of September 30, 2024, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI of 0.1 million, related to securities available for sale, increased 2.6 million, or 104 , compared to accumulated losses of 2.5 million at December 31, 2023. Securities Held to Maturity. Securities held to maturity of 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 550.8 million, or 46 , compared to 1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to purchases of 689.8 million partially offset by remittances of loan payments underlying the securities during the period. Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale of 3.8 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 663.5 million, or 21 , compared to 3.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in loans held for sale was due primarily to an increase in warehouse participations, as we experienced higher volume. Loans held for sale are comprised primarily of single-family residential real estate loan participations that meet Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae pool eligibility. It also includes a growing contribution of multi-family loans that are expected to be sold or securitized within the next year. Loans Receivable, Net. Loans receivable, net of ACL-Loans, of 10.3 billion at September 30, 2024, which are comprised of loans held for investment, increased 134.1 million, or 1 , compared to 10.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in net loans was comprised primarily of: 

 53 

Table of Contents Merchants Bancorp 
 an increase of 461.0 million, or 61 , in mortgage warehouse repurchase agreements, which totaled 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting higher loan volume from increased sales efforts and market exits or reductions of competitors. an increase of 450.0 million, or 11 , in multi-family financing loans, which totaled 4.5 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting higher origination volume for construction and other loans generated through multi-family segment that will remain on our balance sheet until they convert to permanent financing or are otherwise paid off over an average of one to three years. Partially offset by a decrease of 623.0 million, or 26 , in healthcare financing loans, which totaled 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily due to the sale of healthcare loans into a securitization. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 94 of the total net loans reprice within three months, which reduces the risk of market rate increases. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The ACL-Loans of 84.5 million at September 30, 2024 increased 12.8 million, or 18 , compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting an 8.0 million increase in specific reserves, primarily related to two customers, and loan growth in both the warehouse and multi-family loan portfolios. Additional details provided in the ACL-Loans portion of the Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and in Note 4: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. Also influencing the overall level of the ACL-Loans is our differentiated strategy to primarily hold loans with shorter durations while maintaining agency underwriting standards that enable us to sell or refinance the majority of our loans under agency and government programs. Goodwill. Goodwill of 8.0 million at September 30, 2024 decreased 7.8 million, or 49 , compared to 15.8 million at December 31, 2023. The goodwill associated with FMBI was eliminated upon the sale of their branches to unaffiliated third parties on January 26, 2024 . Servicing Rights. Servicing rights of 177.3 million at September 30, 2024 increased 18.9 million, or 12 , compared to December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, originated servicing of 13.3 million and a positive fair market value adjustment of 12.3 million were partially offset by paydowns of 6.7 million. The 12.3 million positive fair market value adjustment reflected a positive fair market value adjustment of 12.6 million for multi-family mortgages and a negative fair market value adjustment of 0.3 million for single-family mortgages and SBA loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Servicing rights are recognized in connection with sales of loans when we retain servicing of the sold loans. The servicing rights are recorded and carried at fair value. The fair value increase recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by higher interest rates that impacted fair market value adjustments. The value of servicing rights generally increases in rising interest rate environments and declines in falling interest rate environments due to expected prepayments and earnings rates on escrow deposits. Other Assets and Receivables. Other assets and receivables of 329.4 million at September 30, 2024 increased 22.3 million, or 7 , compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in other assets and receivables was primarily due to receivables associated with low-income housing tax credit investments. Deposits. Deposits of 12.9 billion at September 30, 2024 decreased 1.2 billion, or 8 , compared to 14.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.0 billion decrease in certificates of deposit, a 150.2 million decrease in demand deposits and a decrease of 12.5 million in savings deposits. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 81 of the total deposits reprice within three months. 

 54 

Table of Contents Merchants Bancorp 
 Core deposits increased by 2 billion, or 25 , to 10.1 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Core deposits represented 78 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 58 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. We have decreased our use of brokered deposits by 3.2 million, or 53 , to 2.8 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 6.0 billion at December 31, 2023. Brokered deposits represented 22 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 42 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. The shift away from brokered deposits was primarily due to more cost-effective funding options that utilized our collateralized borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2024, brokered certificates of deposit had a weighted average remaining duration of 56 days. Brokered certificates of deposit accounts of 2.8 billion at September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.7 billion, or 37 , compared to December 31, 2023. Brokered demand deposit accounts decreased by 1.5 billion, or 100 , compared to December 31, 2023. 
 Compared to December 31, 2023, interest-bearing deposits decreased 960.9 million, or 7 , to 12.6 billion at September 30, 2024, and noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 208.7 million, or 40 , to 311.4 million at September 30, 2024. Uninsured deposits represented approximately 20 of total deposits. Since 2018, the Company has offered its customers an opportunity to insure balances in excess of 250,000 through our insured cash sweep program that extends FDIC protection up to 100 million. The balance of deposits in this program was 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.6 billion as of December 30, 2023 and 1.8 billion as of September 30, 2023. The Company s line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago could fund 120 of uninsured deposits. Borrowings. Borrowings increased 2.6 billion, or 270 , to 3.6 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 964.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 2.6 billion in additional FHLB advances. The higher level of collateralized borrowing was primarily due to it being a more cost effective funding option than utilizing brokered deposits. The Company primarily utilizes borrowing facilities from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve s discount window, and AFX. See Note 12: Borrowings for further information. The Company continues to have significant borrowing capacity based on available collateral. As of September 30, 2024, unused lines of credit totaled 5.1 billion, compared to 6.0 billion at December 31, 2023. Total Shareholders Equity. Total shareholders equity of 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024, increased 238.0 million, or 14 , compared to 1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The 238.0 million increase resulted primarily from net income of 224.7 million and net proceeds of 97.7 million from a common stock offering, which was partially offset by redemption of 7 Series A Preferred Stock for 52.0 million and dividends paid on common and preferred shares of 36.3 million during the period. Asset Quality Although there has been an increase in adversely classified loans, asset values remain strong overall and loans are well-collateralized. Loans are underwritten to strict agency guidelines. We have continued to strengthen our various levels of credit and risk management. Total nonperforming loans (nonaccrual and greater than 90 days late but still accruing) were 210.9 million, or 2.04 , of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 82.0 million, or 0.80 , of total loans at December 31, 2023 and 60.2 million, or 0.60 , at September 30, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans compared to both periods was driven by multi-family and healthcare customers with delinquent payments on variable rate loans that have required higher payments largely due to elevated interest rates. The increase was also attributable to the financial deterioration of 

 55 

Table of Contents Merchants Bancorp 
 a few sponsors. Credit quality is expected to improve with the recent reduction in interest rates. After six months of consecutive loan performance, the loans are placed back on accrual status. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the ACL-Loans was 40 at September 30, 2024 compared to 87 at December 31, 2023 and 111 at September 30, 2023. The decrease in percentage compared to both periods was due to an increase in nonperforming loans, all of which have been individually evaluated for impairment. Total loans greater than 30 days past due were 257.5 million at September 30, 2024, 183.5 million at December 31, 2023, and 125.4 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans compared to both periods was primarily driven by multi-family customers with delinquent payments on variable rate loans that have required higher payments due to interest rates remaining at elevated levels. Loans classified as Special Mention totaled 351.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 191.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in interest rates for our borrowers and the related levels of net operating income on certain properties in the multi-family and healthcare financing loan portfolios. Loans classified as Substandard totaled 287.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 128.6 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in interest rates for our borrowers and the related levels of net operating income on certain properties in the multi-family financing loan portfolio. All substandard loans as of September 30, 2024 have been evaluated for impairment and these loans have specific reserves of 19.2 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 there were 2.1 million of charge-offs and 7,000 of recoveries, compared to 21,000 of charge-offs and 31,000 recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were 6.4 million of charge-offs and 23,000 of recoveries, compared to 9.6 million of charge-offs and 40,000 of recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 84.5 million allowance for credit losses on loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to the net charge-offs of 6.7 million over the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024, could absorb 13 years of losses if recent loss levels continued into the future. In addition to the elevated ACL-loans, the Company has been making efforts to minimize its credit risk through loan sale and securitization activities since 2019. In April 2023 and March 2024, the Company strategically entered into credit protection arrangements through a credit linked note and credit default swap, respectively, for 1.7 billion in loans to reduce our risk of losses with incremental coverage of approximately 14 on those covered loans. The balance of loans in those covered portfolios as of September 30, 2024 was 1.3 billion. Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General. Net income of 61.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 20.2 million, or 25 , compared with 81.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease reflected a 15.4 million, or 13 , increase in net interest income, a 6.0 million, or 56 , increase in gain on sale of loans, a 5.0 million, or 20 , decrease in provision for income taxes, an 18.9 million, or 109 , decrease in loan servicing fees, primarily due to negative fair market value adjustments to derivatives and servicing rights, an 18.4 million, or 43 , increase in noninterest expense, primarily driven by salaries and employee benefits that reflected higher commissions on higher production volume, and increases in deposit insurance expenses, and ongoing premium expense associated with the credit default swap, 

 56 

Table of Contents Merchants Bancorp 
 a 5.6 million decrease in other income, reflecting negative fair market value adjustments to derivatives, and a 2.9 million, or 72 , increase in the provision for credit losses primarily related to increased specific reserves. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income of 132.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 15.4 million, or 13 , compared with 117.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 13 increase reflected an increase in average balances on loans and loans held for sale, which were partially offset by higher average balances on borrowings. The interest rate spread of 2.43 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1 basis points compared to 2.44 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin of 2.99 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remain unchanged compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The margin was negatively impacted by approximately 6 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 from the net reversal of 2.9 million in accrued interest income associated with the movement of loans into nonaccrual status. Interest Income. Interest income of 338.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14 , compared with 296.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily reflecting an increase in average balances of loans and loans held for sale, as well as increased average yields and balances on securities available for sale. Interest income of 290.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for loans and loans held for sale increased 23.7 million, or 9 , compared to 266.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of loans, including loans held for sale, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 billion, or 9 , to 14.6 billion compared to 13.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on loans increased 2 basis points, to 7.91 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.89 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average balances of loans and loans held for sale was primarily due to increases in the loans held for sale, warehouse and multi-family loan portfolios. Interest income of 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on securities available for sale increased 8.7 million, or 140 , compared to 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of securities available for sale of 1.0 billion increased 354.6 million, or 54 , compared to 656.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield increased 210 basis points, to 5.84 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.74 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average balances of securities available for sale was primarily associated with the acquisition of certain securities from a warehouse customer in December 2023 that provide protective put options and interest rate floor derivatives to prevent losses in value. Interest income of 22.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for securities held to maturity increased 4.7 million, or 27 , compared to 17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of securities held to maturity, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 248.4 million, or 24 , to 1.3 billion compared to 1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on securities held to maturity increased 17 basis points, to 6.82 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.65 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average balance of securities held to maturity was primarily related to securities held to maturity acquired as part of loan securitizations. Interest income of 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on interest-earning deposits, and other interest or dividends increased 3.7 million, or 96 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-earning deposits and other of 484.7 million increased 225.1 million, or 87 , compared to 259.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Interest Expense. Total interest expense of 206.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 26.9 million, or 15 , compared to 179.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflected higher average balances on borrowings and interest-bearing checking accounts, partially offset by lower average rates on borrowings and lower average balances on certificates of deposit. Also included in borrowings, our warehouse structured financing agreements provided for additional interest payments for a portion of earnings generated. Interest expense of 40.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on borrowings increased 24.1 million, or 148 , compared to 16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflected an increase of 1.8 billion, or 254 , in the average balance of borrowings, to 2.5 billion compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease of 271 basis points in the average rate of borrowings, to 6.39 compared to 9.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The higher level of collateralized borrowing was primarily due to it being a more cost-effective funding option than utilizing brokered deposits. Interest expense on deposits increased 2.8 million, or 2 , to 165.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 162.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher average balances on interest-bearing checking accounts partially offset by lower average balances on certificates of deposit. Interest expense of 62.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on interest-bearing checking accounts increased 4.0 million, or 7 , compared to 58.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts of 5.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 415.2 million, or 9 , compared to 4.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

We recorded a total provision for credit losses of 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.9 million, or 72 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 72 increase reflected higher specific reserves on a relatively small number of borrowers. The provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflected 8.0 million for specific reserves, primarily related to two customers, and 1.9 million related to charge-offs in excess of reserves, partially offset by a reduction of 3.8 million due to lower loan balances associated with the corresponding healthcare loan securitization. The 6.9 million provision for credit losses consisted of 5.6 million for the ACL-Loans, 2.1 million for the ACL-OBCE s, net of 0.7 million for the release of non-contingent reserves related to a loan securitization. The ACL-Loans was 84.5 million, or 0.82 , of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 71.8 million, or 0.70 , of total loans, at December 31, 2023, and 66.9 million, or 0.67 , at September 30, 2023. Noninterest Income. Noninterest income of 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 19.3 million, or 54 , compared to 36.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 18.9 million, or 109 , decrease in net loan servicing fees and a 5.6 million, or 152 , decrease in other income, partially offset by a 6.0 million, or 56 , increase in gain on sale of loans. Loan servicing fees included a 6.7 million negative fair market value adjustment to servicing rights for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 11.6 million positive adjustment to fair value of servicing rights for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The value of servicing rights generally increases in rising interest rate environments and declines in falling interest rate environments due to expected prepayments and earning rates on escrow deposits. Other income included a 7.7 million negative fair market value adjustment to interest rate floor derivatives on loans that didn t occur in the prior comparative period.

Our Segments We operate in three primary segments: Multi-family Mortgage Banking, Mortgage Warehousing, and Banking. The reportable segments are consistent with the internal reporting and evaluation of the principal lines of business of the Company. The Multi-family Mortgage Banking segment originates and services government sponsored mortgages for multi-family and healthcare facilities through Merchants Capital. Merchants Capital is also a fully integrated syndicator of low-income housing tax credit and debt funds. As one of the top ranked agency affordable lenders in the nation, our licenses with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA, coupled with our bank financing products, provide sponsors with custom beginning-to-end financing solutions that adapt to an ever-changing market. We are also one of the largest Ginnie Mae servicers in the country based on aggregate loan principal value. As of September 30, 2024 the Company s total servicing portfolio had an unpaid principal balance of 28.2 billion, primarily managed in the Multi-Family Mortgage Banking segment. Included in this amount was an unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for others of 17.0 billion, an unpaid principal balance of loans sub-serviced for others of 2.6 billion, and other servicing balances of 0.8 billion at September 30, 2024. These loans are not included in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company also manages 7.8 billion of loans for customers that have loans on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024. The servicing portfolio primarily consists of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac loans and is a significant source of our noninterest income and deposits. Our Mortgage Warehousing segment funds agency eligible loans for non-depository financial institutions from the date of origination or purchase until the date of sale to an investor, which typically takes less than 30 days and is a significant source of our net interest income, loans, and deposits. Mortgage Warehousing has grown to fund over 33.2 billion in 2022, 33.0 billion in 2023, and 32.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Mortgage Warehousing also provides commercial loans and collects deposits related to the mortgage escrow accounts of its customers. The Banking segment includes retail banking, commercial lending, agricultural lending, retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking, and SBA lending. Banking operates primarily in Indiana, except for correspondent mortgage banking which, like Multi-family Mortgage Banking and Mortgage Warehousing, is a national business. The Banking segment has a well-diversified customer and borrower base and has experienced significant growth over the past three years.

 Our segments diversify the net income of Merchants Bank and provide synergies across the segments. Strategic opportunities come from MCC and MCS, where loans are funded by the Banking segment and the Banking segment provides Ginnie Mae custodial services to MCC and MCS. Low-income tax credit syndication and debt fund offerings complement the lending activities of new and existing multi-family mortgage customers. The securities available for sale and held to maturity funded by MCC custodial deposits or purchases of securitized loans originated by MCC are pledged to the FHLB to provide advance capacity during periods of high residential loan volume for Mortgage Warehousing. Mortgage Warehousing provides leads to Correspondent Residential Lending in the Banking segment. Retail and commercial customers provide cross selling opportunities within the banking segment. Merchants Mortgage is a risk mitigant to Mortgage Warehousing because it provides us with a ready platform to sell or refinance the underlying collateral to secure repayment. These and other synergies form a part of our strategic plan. The Other segment presented below, in Note 17: Segment Information, and elsewhere in this report includes general and administrative expenses for provision of services to all segments, internal funds transfer pricing offsets resulting from allocations to or from the other segments, certain elimination entries, and investments in low-income housing tax credit limited partnerships or Limited Liability Companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had total net income of 61.3 million and 81.5 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had total net income of 224.7 million and 201.8 million, respectively. Net income and assets for our segments for the respective periods was as follows:

Comparison of results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: The Multi-family Mortgage Banking segment reported net income of 8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.6 million, or 45 , compared to 14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in loan servicing fees related to negative fair market value adjustments, as well as increased salaries and employee benefits reflecting higher commissions on higher production volume, partially offset by increased gain on sale of loans. Results included a 5.1 million negative fair market value adjustment to servicing rights for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 10.4 million positive fair market value adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding fair market value adjustments to servicing rights, loan servicing fees increased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The volume of loans originated and acquired for sale in the secondary market increased by 341.5 million, or 81 , to 763.7 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Comparison of results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: The Multi-family Mortgage Banking segment reported net income of 33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.8 million, or 21 , from the 27.9 million of net income reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to a 13.3 million increase in gain on sale of loans from higher production volume, a 6.0 million increase in loan servicing fees, as well as a 2.8 million increase in syndication and asset management fees as we continue to see growth in our Low-Income Housing Tax Credits LIHTC syndication of business. These increases to net income were partially offset by a 12.2 million increase in noninterest expenses, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefits related to higher commissions on higher production volume, and increased income tax expense primarily associated with a tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2023 related to tax refunds and changes in state tax apportionment calculations. Loan servicing fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a positive fair market value adjustment of 12.6 million on servicing rights, compared to a positive fair market value adjustment of 10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The volume of loans originated and acquired for sale in the secondary market increased by 150.7 million, or 13 , to 1.4 billion, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2 billion. for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Mortgage Warehousing. Comparison of results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: The Mortgage Warehousing segment reported net income of 15.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 4.0 million, or 20 , compared to 19.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income reflected negative fair value adjustments on derivatives that were partially offset by higher net interest income associated with increased volumes. There was a 22 increase in warehouse loan volume of 13.1 billion compared to 10.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which compared to an industry volume increase of 21 according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Comparison of results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: The Mortgage Warehousing segment reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 58.4 million, an increase of 11.2 million, or 24 , compared to 47.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income reflected higher net interest income as volumes increased, which was partially offset by a negative fair value adjustment on derivatives. There was a 30 increase in warehouse loan volume of 32.0 billion compared to 24.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which compared to an industry volume increase of 17 according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The increase compared to the industry reflected higher loan volume from increased sales efforts and market exits or reductions of competitors. Banking. Comparison of results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: The Banking segment reported net income of 45.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 7.5 million, or 14 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily

Table of Contents Merchants Bancorp 
 due to a lower gain on sale of loans and loan servicing fees, as well as an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included a negative fair market value adjustment of 1.6 million on servicing rights, compared to a positive fair market value adjustment of 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Comparison of results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: The Banking segment reported net income of 153.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9.4 million, or 6 , compared to 144.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher net interest income and lower provision for loan losses, which was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and higher noninterest expense that reflected increased deposit insurance premiums and ongoing premium expenses on the credit default swap executed in March 2024. Lower gain on sale of loans also partially offset the increases to net income. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a negative fair market value adjustment of 0.3 million on servicing rights, compared to a positive fair market value adjustment of 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity . Our primary sources of funds are business and consumer deposits, escrow and custodial deposits, brokered deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, interest on investment securities, and proceeds from sale of loans. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. At September 30, 2024, based on collateral, we had 5.1 billion in available unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve discount window. This compared to 6.0 billion at December 31, 2023. While the amounts available fluctuate daily, we also had available capacity lines through our membership in the AFX. This liquidity enhances the ability to effectively manage interest expense and asset levels in the future. The Company s most liquid assets are in cash, short-term investments, including interest-earning demand deposits, mortgage loans in process of securitization, loans held for sale, and warehouse lines of credit included in loans receivable. Taken together with its unused borrowing capacity of 5.1 billion described above, these totaled 11.1 billion, or 59 , of its 18.7 billion total assets at September 30, 2024. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Our liquid assets and borrowing capacity significantly exceed our uninsured deposits. Uninsured deposits represent approximately 20 of total deposits. Our line of credit with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, alone, could fund 120 of uninsured deposits. Since 2018, the Company has offered its customers an opportunity to insure balances in excess of 250,000 through our insured cash sweep program that extends FDIC protection up to 100 million. The balance of deposits in this program was 1.5 billion and 1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s investment portfolio has minimal levels of unrealized losses and management does not anticipate a need to sell securities for liquidity purposes at a loss. As of September 30, 2024, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI of 0.1 million, related to securities available for sale, increased 2.6 million, or 104 , compared to accumulated losses of 2.5 million as of December 31, 2023.

 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash used in operating activities was 825.3) million and (1.1) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of net change in loans receivable and purchases, sales and maturities of investment securities and loans, was (830.8) million and (2.3) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, which is comprised primarily of net change in borrowings and deposits was 1.7 billion and 3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024 totaled 4.1 billion, or 98 , of total certificates of deposit. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may decide to utilize FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve discount window, brokered deposits, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, we had 4.1 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit that are subject to credit risk and 3.5 billion outstanding commitments subject to certain performance criteria and cancellation by the Company, including loans pending closing, unfunded construction draws, and unfunded lines of warehouse credit. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Additionally, the Company s business model is designed to continuously sell a significant portion of its loans, which provides flexibility in managing its liquidity. Capital Resources. The access to and cost of funding new business initiatives, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on our capital position. The Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC on August 8, 2022, which was declared effective on August 17, 2022, under which we can issue up to 500 million aggregate offering amount of registered securities to finance our growth objectives. As previously demonstrated, the Company also has the ability to utilize securitization transactions to free up capital as needed. The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions and economic forces. We seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to our current operations and to promote public confidence in our Company. Shareholders Equity. Shareholders equity was 1.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The 238.0 million or 14 , increase resulted primarily from net income of 224.7 million and net proceeds of 97.7 million from a common stock offering, which was partially offset by redemption of 7 Series A Preferred Stock for 52.0 million and dividends paid on common and preferred shares of 36.3 million during the period. 7 Series A Preferred Stock. In March 2019 the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of 7.00 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, without par value, and with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share Series A Preferred Stock ). The Company received net proceeds of 48.3 million after underwriting discounts, commissions and direct offering expenses. In April 2019, the Company issued an additional 81,800 shares of Series A 

 70 

Table of Contents Merchants Bancorp 
 Preferred Stock to the underwriters related to their exercise of an option to purchase additional shares under the associated underwriting agreement, resulting in an addition 2.0 million in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts. The Company redeemed all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock on April 1, 2024 for 52 million at a price equal to the liquidation preference of 25.00 per share, using cash on hand. 6 Series B Preferred Stock . In August 2019 the Company issued 5,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40 th interest in a share of its 6.00 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, without par value, and with a liquidation preference of 1,000.00 per share (equivalent to 25.00 per depositary share)( Series B Preferred Stock ). After deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and direct offering expenses, the Company received total net proceeds of 120.8 million. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company s board, are payable quarterly at an annual rate of 60.00 per share (equivalent to 1.50 per depositary share) through September 30, 2024. After such date, quarterly dividends were to accrue and be payable at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 456.9 basis points per year. However, the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock permit us to replace three-month LIBOR if we determine that LIBOR has been discontinued or is no longer viewed as an acceptable benchmark for similar securities. With the cessation of published three-month LIBOR rates as of June 30, 2023, the Company has determined that three-month LIBOR has been discontinued and is no longer an acceptable benchmark. The Company has replaced three-month LIBOR with Federal Reserve s three month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The Company believes that three-month SOFR represents the most comparable replacement benchmark, is an industry-accepted substitute, and is consistent with expectations of investors in securities similar to the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition to replacing three-month LIBOR with three-month SOFR, the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock permit us to adjust the spread to ensure that the payable floating rate remains comparable. Therefore, if the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding on or after October 1, 2024, in addition to using three-month SOFR as the benchmark, the Company will increase the spread by 26.2 basis points, which is consistent with industry practice and the recommendation of the Federal Reserve s Alternative Reference Rates Committee, resulting in the Company paying a floating rate of three-month SOFR plus a spread of 483.1 basis points during the floating rate period. The Company may also redeem the Series B Preferred Stock at its option, subject to regulatory approval, on or after October 1, 2024. On October 1, 2024, the dividends on the Series B Preferred stock started to accrue at a floating rate of 3-month SOFR plus 4.831 and will reset quarterly. The rate will be 9.42 for the fourth quarter 2024. 6 Series C Preferred Stock . On March 23, 2021, the Company issued 6,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40 th interest in a share of its 6.00 Fixed Rate Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, without par value (the Series C Preferred Stock ), and with a liquidation preference of 1,000.00 per share (equivalent to 25.00 per depositary share). The aggregate gross offering proceeds for the shares issued by the Company was 150.0 million, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately 5.1 million paid to third parties, the Company received total net proceeds of 144.9 million. On May 6, 2021, our 8 preferred shareholders participated in a private offering to replace their redeemed 8 preferred shares with the Company s 6 Series C preferred stock. Accordingly, 46,181 shares (1,847,233 depositary shares) of the Company s 6 Series C preferred stock were issued at a price of 25 per depositary share. The total capital raised from the private offering was 46.2 million, net of 23,000 in expenses. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company s board, are payable quarterly. The Company may redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at our option, on any dividend payment date on or after April 1, 2026, subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, at the liquidation preference, plus any declared and unpaid dividends (without regard to any undeclared dividends) to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

 8.25 Series D Preferred Stock . On September 27, 2022, the Company issued 5,200,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40 th interest in a share of its 8.25 Fixed Rate Reset Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, without par value (the Series D Preferred Stock ), and with a liquidation preference of 1,000.00 per share (equivalent to 25.00 per depositary share). The aggregate gross offering proceeds for the shares issued by the Company was 130.0 million, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately 4.6 million paid to third parties, the Company received total net proceeds of 125.4 million. On September 30, 2022, the Company issued an additional 500,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to the underwriters related to their exercise of an option to purchase additional shares under the associated underwriting agreement, resulting in an additional 12.1 million in net proceeds, after deducting 0.4 million in underwriting discounts. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company s board, are payable quarterly. The Company may redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at our option, on any dividend payment date on or after October 1, 2027, subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, at the liquidation preference, plus any declared and unpaid dividends (without regard to any undeclared dividends) to, but excluding, the date of redemption. If the Series D Preferred Stock remains outstanding on October 1, 2027, its dividend rate would reset to the 5-year Treasury rate, plus 4.34 and would remain at that level for an additional 5 years. Common Shares/Dividends . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 45,764,023 common shares issued and outstanding. The Board expects to declare a quarterly dividend of 0.09 per share in each quarter of 2024.

The FDIC categorized FMBI as well capitalized at that time and there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes would have changed that category. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We have identified two primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk and price risk related to market demand.

Table of Contents Merchants Bancorp 
 Interest Rate Risk Overview . Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries or SOFR. Our business consists primarily of funding fixed rate, low risk, multi-family, residential and SBA loans meeting underwriting standards of government programs under an originate to sell model, and retaining adjustable rate loans as held for investment to reduce interest rate risk. Our Asset-Liability Committee, or ALCO, is a management committee that manages our interest rate risk within policy limits established by our board of directors. In general, we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. Our ALCO meets quarterly, at a minimum, to monitor the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors approved risk limits. Additionally, the Risk Committee meets quarterly, in conjunction with Board meetings, to assess risks associated with interest rate sensitivity. Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints. An asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest-earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin. Income Simulation and Economic Value Analysis. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the ALCO at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk. We use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk (NII at Risk) and Economic Value of Equity EVE ). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives and excludes non-interest income. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement. We report NII at Risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The NII at Risk results reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models gradual -200, -100, +100

At September 30, 2024 we are within policy limits set by our board of directors for the -200, -100, +100, and +200 basis point scenarios. The EVE results for Merchants Bank included in the following table reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models immediate -200, -100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates. 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity (Shock) Immediate Change in Rates - 200 - 100 + 100 + 200 (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024: Dollar change (9,224) 4,464 (584) (1,929) Percent change (0.5) 0.2 (0.0) (0.1) December 31, 2023: Dollar change 180,864 92,793 (34,800) (79,455) Percent change 10.8 5.5 (2.1) (4.7) Our interest rate risk management policy limits the change in our EVE to 15 for a +/- 100 basis point move in interest rates, and 20 for a +/- 200 basis point move in rates. We are within policy limits set by our board of directors for the -200, -100, +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. The EVE reported at September 30, 2024 projects that as interest rates increase (decrease) immediately, the economic value of equity position will be expected to decrease (increase). When interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic value; the longer the duration, the greater the value lost. The opposite is true when interest rates fall.
