Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 

Avalon is a minority owner with managerial control over two salt water injection wells and its associated facility. Operations of the salt water injection wells have been suspended in accordance with the Chief of the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management order (See Note 15). Due to the suspension of the salt water injection wells, there were no operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net operating revenues related to waste management services represented approximately and , respectively, of Avalon s total consolidated net operating revenues. Net operating revenues related to waste management services represented approximately of Avalon s total consolidated net operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for of the waste management services segment s net operating revenues to external customers and of the consolidated net operating revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, one customer accounted for of the waste management services segment s net operating revenues to external customers and of the consolidated net operating revenues. 

For our waste management services contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide a series of distinct waste management services over time which integrates a set of tasks (i.e. removal, transportation and disposal of waste) into a single project. Avalon provides substantially the same service over time and the same method is used to measure the Company s progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation to transfer each distinct service in the series to the customer. The series of distinct waste management services, which are the same over time, meets the series provision criteria, and as such, the Company treats that series as a single performance obligation. The Company allocates the transaction price to the single performance obligation and recognizes revenue by applying a single measure of progress to that performance obligation. Avalon transfers control of the service over time and, therefore, satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes the revenue over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by Avalon s performance as we perform. 

In addition, as the promise to provide services qualifies as a series accounted for as a single performance obligation, the Company applied the practical expedient guidance that allows an entity that is recognizing revenue over time by using an output method to recognize revenue equal to the amount that the entity has the right to invoice if the invoiced amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer. The Company applied the standard's practical expedient that permits the omission of disclosures relating to unsatisfied performance obligations as most of the Company s waste management service contracts (i) have an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. 

Avalon is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide waste management services for the customer. Avalon accepts credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer and is obligated to pay vendors who provide the service regardless of whether the customer pays the Company. Avalon does have a level of discretion in establishing the pricing for its service. 

Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the service offered. Avalon does not have any financing arrangements with its customers. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. 

The Company assesses each contract amendment individually. Typically, amendments made to our contracts do not materially change the terms of the agreement or performance obligation of the Company. The Company accounts for such contract amendments as if it were part of the existing contract as the material terms contained in the contract do not change. In cases where Avalon views there is a material change in the terms of the agreement, the Company will reevaluate and determine if the contract should be viewed as an entirely new contract, replacement contract or a continuation of the existing contract. 

Consideration promised in our waste management contracts do not typically include material variable amounts such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, penalties or other such items, and, as such, no estimate is made by the Company for such items. 

Golf and Related Operations 

Avalon s golf and related operations include the operation and management of four golf courses and associated clubhouses, recreation and fitness centers, tennis courts, salon and spa services along with dining and banquet facilities. The golf and related operations also include the operation of a hotel and its related amenities including dining, banquet and conference facilities, fitness center, indoor junior Olympic size swimming pool and tennis courts. Revenues for the golf and related operations consists primarily of food, beverage and merchandise sales, membership dues, greens fees and associated cart rentals, room rentals, fitness activities, salon and spa services. Due to adverse weather conditions, net operating revenues relating to the golf courses, which are located in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania, were minimal during the first three months of 2024 and 2023. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net operating revenues related to the golf and related operations represented approximately and , respectively, of Avalon s total consolidated net operating revenues. For both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net operating revenues related to the golf and related operations represented approximately , of Avalon s total consolidated net operating revenues. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no one customer individually accounted for 10 or more of Avalon s golf and related operations segment revenues. 

For Avalon s golf and related operations, the Avalon Golf and Country Club offers membership packages for use of the country club facilities and its related amenities. Membership agreements are a one year noncancellable commitment and pricing varies based on the membership type selected by the customer. Based on the terms and conditions of the membership contract, resignations received within the membership period do not relieve the member of their annual commitment. Memberships automatically renew on the member s anniversary date unless the member resigns for the upcoming membership period prior to the renewal date. 

Membership for the Avalon Golf and Country Club does not contain up-front initiation fees or require monthly minimum spending at the facilities. Annual membership dues do not cover the cost of food, beverage or any other ancillary paid services which are made available to the member nor do they typically provide for discounts on these goods or services. Members have no obligation to purchase or utilize any of these additional goods or services. Avalon is not required to provide such goods or services unless requested and paid for at the point of sale by the member. 

Under the terms of the contract, Avalon will provide unlimited use and access to the country club facilities. Avalon s performance obligation in the contract is the stand ready obligation to provide access to these facilities for the member for the entire membership term. Avalon providing the stand ready obligation for use of the facilities to the member over the entire term of the membership agreement represents a single performance obligation of which Avalon expects the member to receive and consume the benefits of its obligation throughout the membership term, and as such, the Company recognizes membership dues on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. The Company applied the standard's practical expedient that permits the omission of disclosures relating to unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less as Avalon Golf and Country Club membership agreements are one year in length. 

For our hotel operations, Avalon s performance obligation is to provide lodging facilities. The separate components of providing these services (hotel room, toiletry items, housekeeping, and amenities) are not distinct within the context of the contract as they are all highly dependent and interrelated as part of the obligation to provide the lodging facility. Room sales are driven by a fixed fee charged to a hotel guest to stay at The Grand Resort for an agreed upon period. The Company agrees to provide a room to the hotel guest for a specified time period for that agreed-upon rate. Our hotel room reservations are performance obligations satisfied over time as the hotel guest simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the hotel. For performance obligations satisfied over time, our hotel operations measure the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation and recognize revenue proportionately over the course of the customer s stay. 

For food, beverage, and merchandise sales, greens fees and associated cart rental, fitness activities, salon and spa services and other ancillary services, the transaction price is the set price charged by the Company for those goods or services. Upon purchase of the good or service, the Company transfers control of the good or service to the customer and the customer immediately consumes the benefits of the Company s performance and, as such, we recognize revenue at the point of sale. Amounts paid in advance, such as deposits on overnight lodging or for banquet or conferences facilities, are recorded as a liability until the goods or services are provided to the customer (see Contract Liabilities below). 

The following table presents our net operating revenues disaggregated by revenue source for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands). Sales and other taxes are excluded from revenues.

Avalon does not have operations located outside the United States and, accordingly, geographical revenue information is not presented. 

Receivables, Net 

Receivables, net, include amounts billed and currently due from customers. The amounts due are stated at their net realizable value. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accounts receivable, net, related to our waste management services segment were approximately million. At September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for approximately of the waste management services segment s receivables and of the consolidated receivables. At December 31, 2023, no one customer accounted for 10 or more of the waste management service s segment or consolidated net receivables. Accounts receivable, net, related to our golf and related operations segment were approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. No one customer of the golf and related operations segment accounted for 10 or more of Avalon s golf and related operations segment or consolidated net receivables at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. Customer accounts that are outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. Avalon determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, Avalon s previous accounts receivable loss history, the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to Avalon and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. Avalon writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. Payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for credit losses, or to income, as appropriate under the circumstances. Allowance for credit losses was approximately million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The following table presents changes in our allowance for credit losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Contract Assets 

Contract assets include unbilled membership dues receivables related to the Avalon Golf and Country Club for the customers membership commitment which are billed on a monthly basis over the course of the annual agreement. Such amounts are stated at their net realizable value. Contract assets related to unbilled membership dues are classified as current as revenue related to such agreements is recognized within the annual membership period. Unbilled membership receivables in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were approximately million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 

The following table presents changes in our contract assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Contract Liabilities 

Contract liabilities include unrecognized or deferred revenues relating to membership dues and customer advance deposits. We record deferred revenue when cash payments are received in advance of satisfying our performance obligation. We classify deferred membership dues revenue as current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue for the membership commitment based on the Company satisfying the stand ready performance obligation throughout the annual membership period. The unrecognized or deferred revenues related to membership dues in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were approximately million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Customer advance deposits are recorded as a liability until the goods or services are provided to the customer. Generally, customer advances, and corresponding performance obligation are satisfied within 12 months of the date of receipt of advance payment. The unrecognized revenues related to customer advance deposits are recorded in Other liabilities and accrued expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customer advance deposits were approximately million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 

The following table presents changes in our contract liabilities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Leasehold improvements are included in building improvements and amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or term of the lease. 

Major additions and improvements are charged to the property and equipment accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset, are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal.

At September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any significant fixed contractual commitments for construction projects. 

Avalon reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment exist, Avalon would determine whether the estimated undiscounted sum of the future cash flows of such assets and their eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. If less, an impairment loss would be recognized if, and to the extent that the carrying amount of such assets exceeds their respective fair value. Avalon would determine the fair value by using quoted market prices, if available, for such assets; or if quoted market prices are not available, Avalon would discount the expected estimated future cash flows. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, no triggering events were present. 

year to years. The weighted average remaining lease term on operating leases was approximately years and years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Finance Leases 

In November 2003, Avalon entered into a long-term agreement with Squaw Creek Country Club to lease and operate its golf course and related facilities. The lease has an initial term of ten (10) years with four (4) consecutive ten (10) year renewal term options unilaterally exercisable by Avalon. Under the lease, Avalon is obligated to pay in annual rent and make leasehold improvements of per year. Amounts expended by Avalon for leasehold improvements during a given year in excess of will be carried forward and applied to future leasehold improvement obligations.

At September 30, 2024 there were approximately years remaining on the golf course and related facilities finance lease. At December 31, 2023 there were approximately years remaining on the golf course and related facilities finance lease. The net asset value of finance leases, excluding leasehold improvements was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

In addition, the Company also entered into lease agreements for a vehicle, golf course maintenance and the captive landfill operations entered into lease agreements for equipment which were determined to be finance leases.

million compared to net income attributable to Avalon Holdings Corporation shareholders of million during the three months ending September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to Avalon Holdings Corporation shareholders was million compared to a net loss attributable to Avalon Holdings Corporation shareholders of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Avalon recorded a state income tax provision in both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which was related entirely to the waste management and brokerage operations. Due to the recording of a full valuation allowance against the Company s federal and state net deferred tax assets, the overall effective tax rate in both periods reflects taxes owed in certain U.S state jurisdictions. Avalon s income tax on the income (loss) before taxes was offset by a change in the valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets relating to certain federal and state loss carryforwards will not be realized. Avalon continues to maintain a valuation allowance against the majority of its deferred tax amounts until it is evident that the deferred tax asset will be utilized in the future. 

The Plan has shares of Class A Common Stock available for stock options to employees and non-employee directors. Shares of stock covered by options granted pursuant to The Plan which terminate or expire prior to exercise or have been surrendered or canceled shall be available for further option grants under the Option Plan. 

 The purpose of The Plan is (a) to improve individual employee performance by providing long-term incentives and rewards to employees of Avalon, (b) to assist Avalon in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and non-employee directors with experience and ability, and (c) to associate the interests of such employees and directors with those of the Avalon shareholders. 

NQSO s may be granted with an exercise price which is not less than of the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Options designated as ISO s shall not be less than of fair market value for employees who are ten percent shareholders and not less than of fair market value for other employees. The Board of Directors may, from time to time in its discretion, grant options to one or more outside directors, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may determine, provided that such terms and conditions are not inconsistent with other applicable provisions of the Option Plan. Options shall have a term of no longer than ten years from the date of grant; except that for an option designated as an ISO which is granted to a ten percent shareholder, the option shall have a term no longer than five years. 

No option shall be exercisable prior to one year after its grant, unless otherwise provided by the Option Committee of the Board of Directors (but in no event before months after its grant), and thereafter options shall become exercisable in installments, if any, as provided by the Option Committee. Options must be exercised for full shares of common stock. To the extent that options are not exercised when they become initially exercisable, they shall be carried forward and be exercisable until the expiration of the term of such options. No option may be exercised by an optionee after his or her termination of employment for any reason with Avalon or an affiliate, except in certain situations provided by the Option Plan. 

The stock options, vest ratably over a five year period and have a contractual term of ten years from the date of grant. At the end of each contractual vesting period, the share price of the Avalon common stock, traded on a public stock exchange (NYSE Amex), must reach a predetermined price within three years following such contractual vesting period before the stock options are exercisable (See table below). If the Avalon common stock price does not reach the predetermined price, the stock options will either be cancelled or the period will be extended at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

The grant-date fair values of the stock option awards were estimated using the Monte Carlo Simulation. The Monte Carlo Simulation was selected to determine the fair value because it incorporates six minimum considerations; 1) the exercise price of the option, 2) the expected term of the option, taking into account both the contractual term of the option, the effects of employees expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior, as well as the possibility of change in control events during the contractual term of the option agreements, 3) the current fair value of the underlying equity, 4) the expected volatility of the value of the underlying share for the expected term of the option, 5) the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term of the option and 6) the risk-free interest rate(s) for the expected term of the option. 

The grant date fair value of the underlying equity was determined to be equal to Avalon s publicly traded stock price as of the grant dates times the sum of the Class A and Class B common shares outstanding. 

The expected term, or time until the option is exercised, is based on historical exercising behavior of previous option holders of a company s stock. Because of the nature of the vesting described above, the options are separated into five blocks, with each block having its own vesting period and expected term. 

For stock option awards, the expected volatility is based on the observed historical volatility of Avalon common stock. There were no expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate was based on yield data for U. S. Treasury securities over a period consistent with the expected term. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all options to purchase shares granted were cancelled as the options did not meet the predetermined stock price within the three years following the contractual vesting period. Additionally, all remaining shares previously granted expired. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there are no outstanding options. 

The stock options vest and become exercisable based upon achieving two critical metrics as follows: 

 1) Contract Vesting Term: The stock options vest ratably over a five year period. 

 2) The Avalon common stock price traded on a public stock exchange (NYSE Amex) must reach the predetermined vesting price within three years after the options become vested under the contractual vesting term. 

The table below represents the period and predetermined stock price needed for vesting.

Concurrently with the filing of the appeal with the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, the Company filed a writ of mandamus in the 10 th District Court of Appeals on August 30, 2019 to compel the chief of the Division to issue restart orders, or alternative orders that would allow the Company to either restart the AWMS #2 well, or appeal said orders to the Oil and Gas Commission in accordance with Ohio Law. On October 6, 2020 and in response to a motion from the Division, the Court dismissed this complaint for writ of mandamus. 

In addition, on August 26, 2016, Avalon filed a complaint in the 11 th Appellate District Court in Trumbull County, Ohio for a Peremptory Writ of Mandamus to compel the Director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources ODNR to initiate appropriations procedures to determine damages from the illegal regulatory taking of the Company s property, or issue an alternative remedy at law. The Company believes that the actions, and lack of responsible actions, by the ODNR is a clear violation of the Company s property rights and a violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Article I, Section 19 of the Ohio Constitution; and Ohio Revised Code Chapter 163. 

On March 18, 2019, Avalon received notice that the 11 th Appellate District Court in Trumbull County, Ohio issued summary judgment in favor of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in the writ of mandamus action that resulted from the suspension order of the Company s salt water injection well. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio on April 5, 2019. Oral arguments in the case occurred on April 7, 2020. On September 23, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled in favor of the Company. The Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the decision of the 11 th Appellate District Court and remanded the case back to that court for a trial on the merits. The trial occurred in September and October 2021. On December 19, 2022, the 11 th Appellate District Court denied the Company s writ of mandamus action. The Court determined that the Company failed to establish a cognizable property interest that would necessitate a just compensation/takings analysis and accordingly denied the Company s petition for writ of mandamus. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio on January 30, 2023 and on January 24, 2024 the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled in a unanimous decision to overturn the Court of Appeal s decision. The Supreme Court of Ohio remanded to the Court again for a decision on the mandamus complaint as to whether the Company suffered a total or partial taking. On September 9, 2024, the Court of Appeals issued a decision in accordance with the remand from the Supreme Court of Ohio. The Court of Appeals found that there was no categorical taking of the Company s property, but that there was a partial regulatory taking , and ordered the ODNR to commence appropriations procedures for paying AWMS damages. The decision by the Court of Appeals also found that the seismicity for which AWMS #2 was suspended did not represent imminent threat or harm, and that Division had prevented the Company s attempts to reach a resolution of the matter. Because of the limits on damages set in the decision by the Court of Appeals, the Company again appealed the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court of Ohio on October 11, 2024. 

On May 24, 2021, the Company received Chief s Orders from the Division vacating the September 3, 2014 suspension orders for AWMS #2 and setting conditions for restart of that well. Among these conditions was a limit placed on the seismicity within three miles of the well. Under the Order, if a seismic event with a magnitude 2.1 or above occurs, the well must cease operations for an indefinite period of time until concurrence for subsequent restart is received from the Division. The Company appealed the May 2021 Chief s Order to the Ohio Oil and Gas Commission, seeking reasonable operating conditions that will allow the facility to operate profitably while protecting human health and property. A hearing in this matter occurred in February 2022. On September 30, 2022, the Oil and Gas Commission rendered their decision for the Division in this matter, once again deferring to the Division in their decision. The Company appealed the decision to the Franklin County Ohio Court of Common Pleas on August 3, 2022. On October 31, 2024 the Franklin County Ohio Court of Common Pleas dismissed the appeal.

Working Capital 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was a working capital deficit of approximately 0.5 million and 3.9 million, respectively.

Unbilled membership dues receivable was approximately 0.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.6 million at December 31, 2023.

Inventory was approximately 1.7 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Accounts payable was approximately 7.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 9.7 million at December 31, 2023. Approximately 1.7 million of the decrease in accounts payable between periods was due to the waste management segment.

Accounts payable related to our golf and related operations decreased 0.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, due to associated timing of vendor payments in the ordinary course of business. 

Deferred revenue relating to membership dues was approximately 4.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 3.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to the associated timing of annual membership renewals and, to a lesser extent, an increase in membership dues rates during 2024. 

Accrued payroll and other compensation was approximately 1.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the associated timing of employee payroll payments in the ordinary course of business related to our golf and related operations. 

Management believes that anticipated cash provided from future operations will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and make required monthly payments under our term loan facility. If business conditions warrant additional monies needed, Avalon will take all available actions to fund operating requirements including borrowing from our existing line of credit. 

Growth Strategy 

Waste Management Services Segment 

Our growth strategy for the waste management services segment focuses on increasing revenue, gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal growth. Although we are a waste management services company, we do not own any landfills or provide waste collection services. However, because of our many relationships with various disposal facilities and transporters, we are able to be more flexible and provide alternative solutions to a customer s waste disposal or recycling needs. We intend to capitalize on our management and sales staff which has extensive experience in all aspects of the waste business. As such, we intend to manage our internal growth as follows: 

Sales and Marketing Activities . We will focus on retaining existing customers and obtaining new business through our well-managed sales and marketing activities. We seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our position in many of the markets in which we operate. We provide a tailored program to all of our customers in response to their particular needs. We accomplish this by centralizing services to effectively manage their needs, such as minimizing their procurement costs. 

We currently have a number of professional sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue. For the most part, these employees directly solicit business from existing and prospective customers. We emphasize our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel. We intend to hire additional qualified professional sales personnel to expand into different geographical areas. 

25

Development Activities . We will seek to identify opportunities to further position us as an integrated service provider in markets where we provide services. In addition, we will continue to utilize the extensive experience of our management and sales staff to bid on significant one-time projects and those that require special expertise. Where appropriate, we may seek to obtain permits that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service offerings or leverage our existing volumes with current vendors to provide for long term, cost competitive strategic positioning within our existing markets. 

Golf and Related Operations Segment 

In August 2014, the Company acquired The Grand Resort which was integrated into the golf and related operations segment. The acquisition is consistent with the Company's business strategy in that The Grand Resort provides guests with a self-contained vacation experience, offering hotel guests golf packages to all of the golf courses of the Avalon Golf and Country Club and allows its guests to utilize the facilities at each of the clubhouses. Members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club also have access to all of the amenities offered by The Grand Resort. The Grand Resort is open year-round and provides a consistent, comfortable environment where our guests can enjoy our various amenities and activities. Avalon believes that the combination of its four golf facilities and The Grand Resort will result in additional memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club. 

In addition, several private country clubs in the northeast Ohio area are experiencing economic difficulties. Avalon believes some of these clubs may represent an attractive investment opportunity. While Avalon has not entered into any pending agreements for acquisitions, it may do so at any time and will continue to consider acquisitions that make economic sense. 

Results of Operations 

Avalon s primary business segment, the waste management services segment, provides hazardous and nonhazardous waste brokerage and management services, captive landfill management services and salt water injection well operations. The golf and related operations segment includes the operation and management of four golf courses and related country clubs and facilities, a hotel and its associated resort amenities and a multipurpose recreation center.

Trends and Uncertainties 

Government regulations 

A portion of Avalon s waste brokerage and management services revenues is derived from the disposal and/or transportation of out-of-state waste. Any law or regulation restricting or impeding the transportation of waste or the acceptance of out-of-state waste for disposal could have a negative effect on Avalon. 

Legal matters 

In the ordinary course of conducting its business, Avalon becomes involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including those relating to environmental matters. Some of these proceedings may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against Avalon which, from time to time, may have an impact on its business and financial condition. Although the outcome of such lawsuits or other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management assesses the probability of loss and accrues a liability as appropriate. Avalon does not believe that any uninsured ultimate liabilities, fines or penalties resulting from such pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial position or results of operations. 

Credit and collections 

Economic challenges throughout the industries served by Avalon may result in payment defaults by customers. While Avalon continuously endeavors to limit customer credit risks, customer-specific financial downturns are not controllable by management. Significant customer payment defaults would have a material adverse impact upon Avalon s future financial performance. 

31

Competitive pressures 

Avalon s waste brokerage and management services business obtains and retains customers by providing services and identifying cost-efficient disposal options unique to a customer s needs. Consolidation within the solid waste industry has resulted in reducing the number of disposal options available to waste generators and may cause disposal pricing to increase. Avalon s waste brokerage and management services business may not be able to pass these price increases onto some of its customers, which, in turn, may adversely impact Avalon s future financial performance. 

Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results 

Our operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, which can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including epidemics, pandemics and actions taken by governments to manage economic matters, whether through initiatives intended to control wages, increase in the Federal minimum wage, unemployment, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Adverse economic conditions could pressure Avalon s business and operating performance and financial results may suffer. 

Numerous economic factors, including a recession, other economic downturns, inflation and the potential for a decrease in consumer spending, could adversely affect us 

Various adverse economic conditions, including a recession, other economic downturns and inflation could decrease consumer discretionary spending and adversely affect our financial performance. Rising inflation rates have led to increased interest rates. A recession or other economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The products and services that are golf and related operations offer are products or services that consumers may view as discretionary rather than necessities. Our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, tax rates, and consumer debt levels could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. Slowdowns in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, could materially adversely affect consumer spending habits and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could impact our business and results of operations 

Avalon s success depends in part on our ability to recruit, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in an intensely competitive labor market. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, challenges in adequately staffing, which can negatively impact operations. Our ability to meet labor needs is generally subject to external factors, including the availability of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate. Increased costs and competition associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees could have a negative impact on Avalon s operating margins and profitability. 

The waste brokerage and management division employs individuals with unique capabilities and knowledge in the handling, disposal and transportation of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. In addition, the majority of the senior management and sales representatives have been employed by Avalon for many years and are approaching retirement age. Over the years, the waste brokerage and management division has had difficulty finding qualified individuals with the required expertise in specific geographic areas. Our inability to replace these individuals upon retirement, with the required expertise could have a negative impact on the profitability of the waste brokerage and management division. 

Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

The profitability of our golf and related operations segment depends on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, supplies, fuel, utilities and other operating costs, including labor. We continuously monitor supply and cost trends of these commodities. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we experienced high commodity costs compared to the prior years. These increases are primarily driven by overall market demand and inflationary pressures. Volatility in certain commodity prices and fluctuations in labor costs have adversely affected, and in the future, could adversely affect Avalon s operating results. We anticipate commodity costs to continue to remain elevated throughout 2024 due to inflationary pressures. An increase in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability. 

32

Effective succession planning is important to our continued success 

Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results. 

A majority of Avalon s business is not subject to long-term contracts 

A significant portion of Avalon s business is generated from waste brokerage and management services provided to customers that are not subject to long-term contracts. In light of current economic, regulatory and competitive conditions, there can be no assurance that Avalon s current customers will continue to transact business with Avalon at historical levels. Failure by Avalon to retain its current customers or to replace lost business could adversely impact the future financial performance of Avalon. 

Avalon s captive landfill management business is dependent upon a single customer as its sole source of revenue. If the captive landfill management business is unable to retain this customer, Avalon s future financial performance could be adversely impacted. 

A significant source of the golf and related operations revenues is derived from the members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Members are obligated to pay dues for a one year period. As such, the golf and related operations is primarily dependent on the sale and renewal of memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club, on a year to year basis. 

Avalon's loan and security agreement may obligate it to repay debt before its maturity 

The Company s loan and security agreement contains certain covenants and events of default. Should Avalon be unable to meet one or more of these covenants, its lender may require it to repay any outstanding balance prior to the expiration date of the agreement. Our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants in our loan and security agreement may be affected by worsening economic or business conditions, or other events that may be beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities in amounts sufficient to enable us to service debt and meet these covenants. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. The Company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to pay off any long-term borrowings under the loan and security agreement, so as to avoid default. 

Saltwater disposal wells 

Saltwater disposal wells are regulated by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources ODNR ), with portions of the disposal facilities regulated by the Ohio EPA. As exploitation of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations by the hydrofracturing process develops, regulatory and public awareness of the environmental risks of saltwater brine and its disposal in saltwater disposal wells is growing and consequently, it is expected that regulation governing the construction and operation of saltwater disposal wells will increase in scope and complexity. Increased regulation may result in increased construction and/or operating costs, which could adversely affect the financial results of Avalon. The saltwater disposal wells are currently not operational. Assuming operations resume in the future, there is a risk during the operation of an environmental event causing contamination to the water tables in the surrounding area, or seismic events. The occurrence of a spill or contamination at a disposal well site could result in remedial expenses and/or result in the operations at the well site being suspended and/or terminated by the Ohio EPA or the ODNR. Incurring remedial expenses and /or a suspension or termination of Avalon s right to operate one or more saltwater disposal wells at the well site could have an adverse effect on Avalon s financial results. As a result of a seismic event with a magnitude of 2.1 occurring on August 31, 2014, the Chief of the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management Chief or Division issued Orders on September 3, 2014 to immediately suspend all operations of Avalon s two saltwater injection wells until the Division could further evaluate the wells. The Orders were based on the findings that the two saltwater injection wells were located in close proximity to an area of known seismic activity and that the saltwater injection wells pose a risk of increasing or creating seismic activity. 

On September 5, 2014, Avalon submitted the information required by the Chief s Order in regards to its AWMS #1 injection well, and the Chief lifted the suspension for that well on September 18, 2014. On September 19, 2014, Avalon submitted information and a written plan required by the Chief s Order proposing the establishment of certain operations and management controls on injections for the AWMS #2 injection well. To date, the Division has not responded to that plan despite Avalon s requests for feedback. 

33

On October 2, 2014, Avalon filed an appeal with the Ohio Oil and Gas Commission (the Commission disputing the basis for suspending operations of AWMS #2 and also the authority of the Chief to immediately suspend such operations. On March 11, 2015, an appeal hearing was held. The Chief stated during the hearing that the suspension order is temporary, and he expects that AWMS #2 will be allowed to resume operations once the state s final policymaking is complete. 

On August 12, 2015, the Commission upheld the temporary suspension of injection operations of AWMS #2 stating that the temporary suspension would allow the Chief more time to fully evaluate the facts in anticipation of the Division s implementation of a comprehensive regulatory plan that will specifically address injection-induced seismicity. 

Avalon appealed that decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (the Court ), and on November 1, 2016 an appeal hearing was held in that Court. On December 23, 2016, the Court issued its Decision and Order in Avalon s favor, and vacated the Commission s decision. The Court found that the Division s suspension and refusal to work with the Company over the 26 month period was arbitrary and not in accordance with reason. Subsequent to the ruling, and in accordance with the Court s Decision and Order, both Avalon and the Division submitted their proposed restart plans to the Court. Avalon s plan sets forth both the initial volumes and pressures and increases in volume and pressure while continuously monitoring seismicity and addressing the concerns of public health and safety. 

On February 21, 2017, the Court issued its Final Decision and Order. The Court s Final Decision and Order set forth conditions for restarting the AWMS #2 salt water injection well in accordance with the proposed restart plans filed by Avalon with minor revisions. On February 22, 2017, the Division appealed the Final Decision and Order and filed a Motion to Stay the Court Order. The Motion to Stay was granted by the Ohio 10 th District Court of Appeals on March 21, 2017. 

On September 14, 2017, an appeal hearing was held in the Ohio 10 th District Court of Appeals and on July 31, 2018 a decision was issued on the appeal. The decision reinstated the previous Ohio Oil and Gas Commission decision in this matter. 

On September 12, 2018, the Company appealed the Ohio 10 th District Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court of Ohio. On November 21, 2018, the Company received notice from the Supreme Court of Ohio that the court would not accept for review the Company s appeal of the Ohio 10 th District Court of Appeals decision on the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management s appeal of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas February 21, 2017 entry allowing restart of the Company s AWMS Water Solutions, LLC #2 salt water injection well. 

On April 5, 2019, Avalon filed with the Oil and Gas Commission a motion to vacate its prior decisions in this matter. The Oil and Gas Commission scheduled a hearing on this motion for August 13, 2019. Before the hearing began, and in response to the Division s motion to dismiss the Company s motion to vacate, the Commission dismissed the matter. The Company appealed that decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. In April 2020, the Division s motion to dismiss and the Company s opposition were reviewed by the Court. Following the restart orders received on May 24, 2021, and discussed below, the Court dismissed the complaint. 

Concurrently with the filing of the appeal with the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, the Company filed a writ of mandamus in the 10 th District Court of Appeals on August 30, 2019 to compel the chief of the Division to issue restart orders, or alternative orders that would allow the Company to either restart the AWMS #2 well, or appeal said orders to the Oil and Gas Commission in accordance with Ohio Law. On October 6, 2020 and in response to a motion from the Division, the Court dismissed this complaint for writ of mandamus. 

In addition, on August 26, 2016, Avalon filed a complaint in the 11 th Appellate District Court in Trumbull County, Ohio for a Peremptory Writ of Mandamus to compel the Director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources ODNR to initiate appropriations procedures to determine damages from the illegal regulatory taking of the Company s property, or issue an alternative remedy at law. The Company believes that the actions, and lack of responsible actions, by the ODNR is a clear violation of the Company s property rights and a violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Article I, Section 19 of the Ohio Constitution; and Ohio Revised Code Chapter 163. 

34

On March 18, 2019, Avalon received notice that the 11 th Appellate District Court in Trumbull County, Ohio issued summary judgment in favor of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in the writ of mandamus action that resulted from the suspension order of the Company s salt water injection well. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio on April 5, 2019. Oral arguments in the case occurred on April 7, 2020. On September 23, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled in favor of the Company. The Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the decision of the 11 th Appellate District Court and remanded the case back to that court for a trial on the merits. The trial occurred in September and October 2021. On December 19, 2022, the 11 th Appellate District Court denied the Company s writ of mandamus action. The Court determined that the Company failed to establish a cognizable property interest that would necessitate a just compensation/takings analysis and accordingly denied the Company s petition for writ of mandamus. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio on January 30, 2023 and on January 24, 2024 the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled in a unanimous decision to overturn the Court of Appeal s decision. The Supreme Court of Ohio remanded to the Court again for a decision on the mandamus complaint as to whether the Company suffered a total or partial taking. On September 9, 2024, the Court of Appeals issued a decision in accordance with the remand from the Supreme Court of Ohio. The Court of Appeals found that there was no categorical taking of the Company s property, but that there was a partial regulatory taking , and ordered the ODNR to commence appropriations procedures for paying AWMS damages. The decision by the Court of Appeals also found that the seismicity for which AWMS #2 was suspended did not represent imminent threat or harm, and that Division had prevented the Company s attempts to reach a resolution of the matter. Because of the limits on damages set in the decision by the Court of Appeals, the Company again appealed the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court of Ohio on October 11, 2024. 

On May 24, 2021, the Company received Chief s Orders from the Division vacating the September 3, 2014 suspension orders for AWMS #2 and setting conditions for restart of that well. Among these conditions was a limit placed on the seismicity within three miles of the well. Under the Order, if a seismic event with a magnitude 2.1 or above occurs, the well must cease operations for an indefinite period of time until concurrence for subsequent restart is received from the Division. The Company appealed the May 2021 Chief s Order to the Ohio Oil and Gas Commission, seeking reasonable operating conditions that will allow the facility to operate profitably while protecting human health and property. A hearing in this matter occurred in February 2022. On September 30, 2024, the Oil and Gas Commission rendered their decision for the Division in this matter, once again deferring to the Division in their decision. The Company appealed the decision to the Franklin County Ohio Court of Common Pleas on August 3, 2022. On October 31, 2024 the Franklin County Ohio Court of Common Pleas dismissed the appeal. 

Golf memberships and liquor licenses 

The Avalon Golf and Country Club operates four golf courses and related country clubs and a multipurpose recreation center. The Avalon Golf and Country Club facilities also offer swimming pools, fitness centers, tennis courts, dining and banquet facilities, salon and spa services. In addition, The Grand Resort provides guests with a self-contained vacation experience, offering hotel guests golf packages to all of the golf courses of the Avalon Golf and Country Club and allows its guests to utilize the facilities at each of the clubhouses. Members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club also have access to all of the amenities offered by The Grand Resort. The Avalon Golf and Country Club competes with many public courses and country clubs in the area. Although the golf courses continue to be available to the general public, the primary source of revenues is derived from the members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Avalon believes that the combination of its golf facilities and The Grand Resort will result in additional memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club. The ability to retain current members and attract new members has been an ongoing challenge. Although Avalon was able to increase the number of members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club, as of September 30, 2024, Avalon has not attained its membership goals. There can be no assurance as to when such goals will be attained. Avalon is continually using different marketing strategies to attract new members, such as local television advertising and various membership promotions. A significant decline in members could adversely affect the future financial performance of Avalon. 

Avalon s golf course operations, The Grand Resort and multipurpose recreation center currently hold liquor licenses for their respective facilities. If, for some reason, any one of these facilities were to lose their liquor license, the financial performance of the golf and related operations would be adversely affected. 

Seasonality 

Avalon s operations are somewhat seasonal in nature since a significant portion of those operations are primarily conducted in selected northeastern and midwestern states. Additionally, Avalon s golf courses are located in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania and are significantly dependent upon weather conditions during the golf season. As a result, Avalon s financial performance is adversely affected by adverse weather conditions. 

35

Inflation 

The Federal Reserve has kept its key interest rates at elevated levels as pricing on consumer goods has remained high. Our operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, including inflation, which can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Although Avalon has not entered into any long-term fixed price contracts that could have a material adverse impact upon its financial performance in periods of inflation, adverse economic conditions could pressure Avalon s business and operating performance and financial results may suffer. In general, management believes that rising costs resulting from inflation could be passed on to customers; however, Avalon may need to absorb all or a portion of these cost increases depending upon competitive conditions at the time. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Avalon does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates. 

Borrowings under our New Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.00 until the seventh anniversary date of the closing at which time the interest rate will be reset to a fixed rate equal to the greater of (a) 6.00 per annum or (b) the sum of the three year treasury rate on the date two (2) business days prior to the reset date plus 3.40 , provided that the applicable rate shall in no event exceed 8.50 per annum. 

Outstanding borrowings under our Line of Credit Agreement bear interest at Prime Rate plus .25 . At September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Line of Credit Agreement was 8.25 . At September 30, 2024, approximately 3.2 million was outstanding under the Line of Credit Agreement. 

Avalon does not undertake any specific actions to cover its exposure to interest rate risk and Avalon is not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions. Avalon does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), Avalon s management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. For purposes of the foregoing, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Avalon s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as outlined above. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that they believe that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting . 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
