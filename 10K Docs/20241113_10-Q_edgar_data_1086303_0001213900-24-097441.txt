and equity interest of Hongchang BVI, respectively. On February 6, 2023, Hongchang BVI incorporated a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Hong Chang Biotechnologies (HK) Limited Hongchang HK ). On February 28, 2023, Hongchang HK incorporated
a wholly-owned subsidiary, Fujian Hongjin Biotechnology Co., Ltd. WFOE in the People s Republic of China PRC ).
WFOE then purchased the total equity interest of Hongchang Food. After the Reorganization, Mr. Zengqiang Lin and Ms. Zhenzhu Lin
hold and equity interest of Hongchang Food through WFOE, respectively. As all the entities involved in the process of
the Reorganization are under common ownership of Hongchang Food s stockholders before and after the Reorganization, the Reorganization
is accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests with the assets and liabilities of the parties to the Reorganization carried
over at their historical amounts. Therefore, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared as if
the corporate structure of the Group had been in existence since the beginning of the periods presented. 

(c) Reverse merger 

On August 21, 2023, HYBT entered
into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with Hongchang BVI and Hongchang BVI s stockholders,
Zengqiang Investment Limited, a business company incorporated in the BVI, and Hong Jin Investment Limited, a business company incorporated
in the BVI (the Selling Stockholders and each a Selling Stockholder ), in relation to the acquisition of Hongchang
BVI by HYBT (the Hongchang Acquisition ). Zengqiang Investment Limited is wholly-owned by Mr. Zengqiang Lin and Hong Jin
Investment Limited is wholly-owned by Ms. Zhenzhu Lin. Mr. Zengqiang Lin has been a director of HYBT since February 17, 2023, and Ms.
Zhenzhu Lin is the sister of Mr. Zengqiang Lin. In accordance with the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Selling Stockholders
sold and transferred shares of Hongchang BVI, constituting all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Hongchang
BVI, to HYBT in exchange for an aggregate of new shares of HYBT s common stock (the Consideration Shares ),
of which shares were issued to Zengqiang Investment Limited and shares were issued to Hong
Jin Investment Limited. 

Immediately following the
closing of the Hongchang Acquisition, HYBT had a total of issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Consideration
Shares constitute of its enlarged share capital following the closing of the Hongchang Acquisition. The exchange consideration
for the Hongchang Acquisition was determined on an arms length basis based on our valuation of Hongchang BVI and its subsidiaries
and its assets. 

As HYBT, the legal acquirer
and accounting acquiree, does not meet the definition of a business, management concluded that the Merger should be accounted for as a
continuation of the financial statements of Hongchang BVI (the legal subsidiary), together with a deemed issue of shares and a re-capitalization
of the equity of Hongchang BVI. Hongchang BVI is the continuing entity and is deemed to have issued shares in exchange for the identifiable
net assets held by HYBT together with the listing status of HYBT. Management concluded that September 4, 2023 is the acquisition date
of the Merger. 

Upon the completion of the
reverse merger, the Company has set up a few new subsidiaries: Fujian Hongchang Global Food Co., Ltd Hongchang Global Food ),
Fuqing Hongchang Global Import Export Co., Ltd Hongchang Import Export ), Fuqing Hongchang Global Supply Chain
Co., Ltd Hongchang Supply Chain ), and Hongchang Global (Fuqing City) Agricultural Technology Development Co., Ltd Hongchang
Agricultural in order for the company to develop different businesses. As of the date of this report, these subsidiaries have
not generated significant revenue.

2023, Hongchang Food secured an interest-free loan agreement with Zengqiang Lin, enabling it to access up to RMB million (approximately
US million) from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2026. Consequently, the combination of the Company s current cash reserves, the
capital contributions received, and the loans from shareholders are anticipated to provide sufficient funds to carry out the Company s
planned operations through the next twelve months.

Agricultural to an unrelated individual third party for a total consideration of RMB . Hongchang Agricultural is not a significant

have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. As a result, the results of operations for Hongchang Agricultural

nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized gain on the disposal of all of the interests in Hongchang Agricultural.

As per the Reorganization

Revenue 

Our business is in its early stages, revenue represents the sales of goods supplied to customers, and sales are primarily driven by the
demand from customers. The growth of our revenue will be primarily driven by increasing our product variety, expanding the distribution
network, both in China and overseas and the initiation of other projects or business lines in the future. Revenue is influenced by potential
competitors entering the market, economic conditions, pricing, inflation, product diversification, and customer consumption habits. We
generated revenue of US 2,820,710 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 3,506.86 compared
to US 78,204 for the same period of 2023. This substantial increase was mainly because we have established a subsidiary, Hongfu Food,
which primarily engaged in meat processing and trade, particularly in customized processed meat for customers starting from the second
quarter of 2024. We began market trial operations in the first quarter of 2023, and until the first nine months of 2024, we have increased
our business lines and achieved a significant increase in business revenue. Ensure that revenue and costs are within a reasonable range
of market operations. 

Cost of revenue 

Cost of revenues represents costs and expenses directly attributable to the purchase of our products sold and delivered, and direct labor
costs. Cost of revenues were US 2,672,132 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 2,458.78 
compared to US 104,430 for the same period of 2023. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to our subsidiary, Hongfu food,
beginning food production and distribution and we recognized related costs including purchase price of products, shipping and handling
expenses and related costs. We have been operating since the beginning of 2023, continuously accumulating industry experience and adjusting
our strategic plans according to market changes over the course of this period. 

Gross profit and margin 

Gross profit is the difference
between revenue and cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue mainly includes purchasing raw material and prepackaged products. The supply
and prices of our products may be influenced by various factors, including product types, seasonal fluctuations, demand, and macroeconomic
environment. Due to the increase in the prices of our suppliers goods, we may not be able to raise prices to compensate for the
increased costs, which will have a negative impact on our business results and profitability. We believe that if our strategic business
development plan can proceed smoothly, we will collaborate with more suppliers to expand our product supply range and establish mature
procurement plans to control costs. 

Gross margin is gross profit
divided by revenue. Gross margin is a measure used by management to indicate whether we are selling products at an appropriate gross profit.
Our gross margin is influenced by product prices, product combinations, availability, and discounts, as some products typically offer
higher gross profit margins, as well as the impact of our product costs, which may vary. At present, we offer competitive prices to attract
and retain customers. In the future, as we grow, we will launch diversified products and competitive services to increase market share.
We regularly evaluate the profitability of its products. As our business activities started in 2023 and till now, we are still at an early
stage, we had a gross profit of US 148,578 and gross loss of US 26,226 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. 

Operating expenses 

Our operating expenses consist
of sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, which primarily include payroll, employee benefit expenses and
bonus expenses, promotion and advertising expenses, and other facility related costs, such as utilities, and depreciation. 

21 

General and administrative expenses 

We incurred general and
administrative expenses of US 326,016 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 14.56 
as compared to US 381,579 in the same period of 2023, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly
due to the decrease in professional fees paid to third parties. 

Income tax benefit 

We incurred income tax benefit
of US 11,580 and income tax expense of US 3,826 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Net loss

we reported a net loss of US 163,020 and US 392,435 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively.

Revenue 

Our business is in its early stages, revenue represents the sales of
goods supplied to customers, and sales are primarily driven by the demand from customers. Our revenue growth will mainly be achieved through
improving the layout of the industrial chain, increasing the operation of the food industry park, conducting comprehensive and group based
operations in food trade, meat processing, and retail sales. Revenue is influenced by potential competitors entering the market, economic
conditions, pricing, inflation, product diversification, and customer consumption habits. We generated revenue of US 820,608 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 1,496.61 compared to US 51,397 for the same period of 2023. This significant increase
was mainly because we have established a subsidiary, Hongfu Food, which primarily engaged in meat processing and trade, mainly customized
processed meat for customers starting from the second quarter of 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The discussion and analysis of our Group s financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our Group s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP in a consistent manner. The preparation of these financial statements requires the selection and application
of accounting policies. Further, the application of U.S. GAAP requires our Group to make estimates and judgments about future events that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, our Group evaluate
its estimates, including those discussed below. Our Group bases its estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other
assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 

Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our Group believes it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable
judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. Our Group believes
that it has appropriately applied its critical accounting policies. However, in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were
used relating to the critical accounting policies below, our Group s consolidated statements of operations could be misstated. 

25 

A detailed summary of significant accounting policies
is summarized below: 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and
the reported revenue and expenses during the reported period in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Significant accounting estimates reflected in our Group s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements mainly include,
but are not limited to, assessment for impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of deferred tax assets and current expected credit loss
of receivables. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Construction-in-progress 

Property and equipment that
are purchased or constructed which require a period of time before the assets are ready for their intended use are accounted for as construction-in-progress.
Construction-in-progress is recorded at acquisition cost, including installation costs. Construction-in-progress is transferred to specific
property and equipment accounts and commences depreciation when these assets are ready for their intended use. 

Land use right, net 

The land use rights represent
the operating lease prepayments for the rights to use the land in the PRC. Amortization of the prepayments is provided on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the respective land use rights certificates. 

Revenue recognition 

The Group adopted Accounting
Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customer. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with
customers, The Group performs the following five steps: 

Step 1: Identify the contract
with the customer 

Step 2: Identify the performance
obligations in the contract 

Step 3: Determine the transaction
price 

Step 4: Allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract 

Step 5: Recognize revenue
when the Group satisfies a performance obligation 

The Group generates revenue
from food trading business. 

The Group enters into contracts
with their customers to provide food, mainly frozen pork. All of the Group s contracts have single performance obligation as the
promise is to transfer the goods to customers, and there are no other separately identifiable promises in the contracts. The Group recognizes
revenue when it transfers its goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled
in such exchange. The Group accounts for the revenue generated from sales of its products to its customers on a gross basis, because the
Group is acting as a principal in these transactions, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, and is responsible
for fulfilling the promise to provide customers the specified goods. The Group s revenue is recognized at a point in time when the
control has been transferred, usually when the customer accepts the goods.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of
Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller
reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of a material weakness
primarily related to a lack of a sufficient number of personnel with appropriate training and experience in accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. In the future, we intend to hire more personnel with sufficient training and experience
in U.S. GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

We believe that a control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met,
and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within any company
have been detected. 

27 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. There are currently
no legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating
results. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Smaller reporting companies
are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
