Company s retinal imaging capabilities. The combined technology is expected to have the ability to screen, monitor and provide
data to profile trends and create diagnostic markers for systemic and retinal disorders in the cardiovascular, Alzheimer s and
Parkinson disease. The markers and data analysis are rapid and cost effective, thereby eliminating expensive diagnostic equipment

was recorded as acquired in-process research and development costs in the associated consolidated statement of operations in the
quarter ended September 30, 2022. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

The
Company has had net losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of approximately at September 30, 2024. In addition,
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31 2023, the Company had liabilities of approximately and , respectively,
a significant portion of which is with related parties. The Company has minimal cash at September 30, 2024 and remains dependent on related
parties for much of its financing. The Company expects that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will occur for at
least the next several years, and the Company will need to access additional funds to achieve its strategic goals with respect to the
sublicensed technology. The Company is in discussions with investment bankers and individual investors with respect to raising additional
capital for the Company and potentially up-listing to NASDAQ exchange. 

Sanovas
has paid a significant portion of the Company s operating expenses through September 2024, and was owed approximately 
 as of September 30, 2024 by the Company. The Company issued shares of its common stock to offset amounts due to Sanovas for payment
of expenses on behalf of the Company of during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company also issued shares
of its common stock to offset due to a vendor in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 to settle an account payable. 

As
of the date of this report, the Company does not have adequate resources to fund its operations through November 2024 without considering
any potential future milestone payments that it may receive under any new collaborations that it may enter into in the future or any
future capital raising transactions. The Company will need to raise additional funding to complete the development of its products and
commence the market launch, assuming regulatory approval is obtained. The Company does not know whether additional financing will be
available when needed, whether it will be available on favorable terms, or if it will be available at all. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 
shares of common stock. 

Potentially
dilutive securities not included in the computation of loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, include
stock options to purchase shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock, and warrants
to purchase shares of common stock. 

years), once the asset is placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the economic useful life of
the related assets, are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures which extend the economic life are capitalized. When assets
are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costs and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and
any gain or loss on disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the respective period. 

The
Company s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.

Sublicense Agreement at any time upon 90 days written notice to Sanovas Ophthalmology. No royalties have been paid through September
30, 2024 under this Sublicense Agreement.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview 

We
are an ophthalmic research and development company focused on developing technologies to screen, monitor, diagnose and treat ophthalmic,
optical, and sight-threatening disorders. Our mission is to prevent vision loss and blindness due to diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy
through two devices: (1) Retinal Imaging Screening Device , a portable, retinal imaging system providing a 200-degree field of
view without requiring pupil dilation; and (2) RetinalCam TM , a home monitoring and imaging device offering real-time
communication and alerting system for physicians available 24/7. 

To
date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing, business planning, raising capital, designing and developing
product candidates, and securing manufacturing and sales/distribution partners. We do not have any products approved for sale and have
not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the private placement of common stock. 

We
anticipate that we will need an additional 12,200,000 to (i) complete product design and testing for RetinalGenix TM and RetinalCam TM
 and submit RetinalGenix TM for FDA clearance (we anticipate that the RetinalCam TM will not require FDA clearance);
(ii) complete the development and expansion of the software tools around the recently acquired DNA/GPS genetic mapping technology;
and (iii) build the infrastructure for our sustained growth. We intend to obtain such funds through the sales of our equity and debt
securities and/or through potential strategic partnerships; however, no assurance can be provided that funds will be available to us
on acceptable terms, if at all. 

We
do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development of RetinalCam TM ,
and we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully obtain regulatory clearance for RetinalGenix TM .
In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting,
investor relations, compliance and other expenses. 

As
a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such
time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through
public or private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other capital
sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms or
at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial
condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant
rights to develop and market our product candidates. 

We
issued shares of our common stock pursuant to a private placement raising approximately 3.0 million from the sale of 3,070,000 shares
of common stock from 2019 through January 2022. In October 2021, the registration statement on Form S-1 (the Registration Statement that we filed with the Securities and exchange Commission (the SEC pursuant to which we registered for resale shares of
common stock, including shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants was declared effective. No
funds were raised by the Company pursuant to the Registration Statement. We commenced a private placement of common stock in 2024, and
have raised approximately 428,000 through the date of this filing. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if
we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If
we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations
at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.

accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America US GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiary, DNA/GPS, Inc. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30,
2024, there have been no material changes in the Company s significant accounting policies from those that were disclosed in the
2023 Annual Report. 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We
have not generated any revenue since our inception. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses include personnel costs associated with research and development activities, including third-party contractors
to perform research, product and prototype development, and testing of materials. Research and development expenses are charged to operations
as incurred. 

We
accrue for costs incurred by external service providers based on our estimates of services performed and costs incurred. These estimates
include the level of services performed by third parties and other indicators of the services completed. 

We
cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of future clinical trials and product development or if, when or to what extent
we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing clearance. We may
never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of product development will depend
on a variety of factors, including: 

the
 scope, rate of progress, expense and results of product development, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates
 and other research and development activities that we may conduct; 

the
 actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition,
 manufacturing capability and commercial viability; 

significant
 and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the
 timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and 

the
 expense of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change
in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. 

16 

General
and administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and consulting related expenses. Administrative expenses also include
professional fees and other corporate expenses, including legal fees relating to corporate matters; professional fees for
accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses, marketing activities and other operating costs
that are not specifically attributable to research activities. We have no full-time employees and have had limited funding,
therefore the Company has been required to eliminate or defer as many costs as possible based upon available resources. 

We
expect that our administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support our continued research
activities and development of our product candidates. We also expect increased expenses associated with being a public company, including
costs related to accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with compliance with SEC requirements; director
and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense is the coupon interest rate charged on loans from stockholders.

Based Compensation Expenses 

Stock-based
compensation expenses increased by 1,654,398, or 282 , to 2,240,099 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 585,701 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of expense for options issued in the first
quarter of 2024, of which a significant portion was vested immediately.

the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Administrative costs consisting of costs related to executives from Sanovas, were
allocated based upon the amount of effort spent by such personnel on our business, and increased by approximately 101,000 over the
2023 levels. Salaries allocated to the Company from Sanovas increased in 2024 since the majority of time spent by Sanovas employees
were on Company activities. The Company also incurred significant fees as its portion of the legal costs in the Gerrans litigation
matter described in Note D to the consolidated financial statements. Other administrative expenses, specifically legal and
accounting fees, travel and marketing fees were higher because of fund raising and listing related expenses.

compensation expenses decreased by 132,427, or 31 , to 296,256 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 428,683 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of expense for options issued in the third quarter
of 2023, much of which was fully vested upon issuance.

the three months ended September 30, 2023. Administrative costs consisting of costs related to executives from Sanovas, were
allocated based upon the amount of effort spent by such personnel on our business, and increased by approximately 34,000 over the
2023 levels. Salaries allocated to the Company from Sanovas increased in 2024 since the majority of time spent by Sanovas employees
were on Company activities. The Company also incurred 25,000 in fees as its portion of the legal costs in the Gerrans litigation
matter described in Note D to the consolidated financial statements. Other administrative expenses, specifically marketing fees were
higher because of fund raising and listing related activities. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

To
date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing, business planning, raising capital, designing and developing
product candidates, and securing manufacturing and sales/distribution partners. We do not have any products approved for sale and have
not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily from the sale of common stock, loans and advances
from related parties and by utilizing Sanovas personnel and facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received
approximately 20,000 of advances and invoices paid by affiliates, 210,000 from the exercise of stock options and 405,000 pursuant
to recent private placement of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 79,089 and liabilities of 1,943,169. As of the date of this report, we do not have adequate
resources to fund our operations beyond December 2024 without considering any future capital raising transactions. 

We
anticipate that we will need 12,200,000 in operating capital to (i) complete product design and testing for RetinalGenix TM 
and RetinalCam TM and submit RetinalGenix TM for FDA approval (we anticipate that the RetinalCam TM will
not require FDA approval); (ii) complete the development and expansion of the software tools around the recently acquired DNA/GPS 
genetic mapping technology; and (iii) build the infrastructure for our sustained growth. We do not expect to generate any revenues from
product sales unless and until we successfully complete development of RetinalGenix TM and RetinalCam TM and obtain
regulatory approval for RetinalGenix TM . We will also require additional operating capital as a result of us operating as a
public company, including for legal, accounting, investor relations, compliance and other expenses. 

As
a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such
time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through
public or private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other capital
sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms or
at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial
condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant
rights to develop and market our product candidates. 

19 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if
we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If
we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations
at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 

Cash
Flow Activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 555,546 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The cash flow used in operating activities
in 2024 was driven by the net loss of 3,453,800 offset in part by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 2,240,099 and an increase
in accounts payable and accrued interest payable of 153,526. In addition, Sanovas billed us for allocated costs and expenses paid on
behalf of and allocated to us in the amount of 496,800 and we received 9,749 of net cash advances from Sanovas during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 161,636 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash flow used in operating activities
in 2023 was driven by the net loss of 1,549,253 offset in part by non-cash stock-based compensation expenses of 585,701 and an increase
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 278,788. In addition, Sanovas billed us for allocated costs and expenses paid on behalf
of and allocated to us in the amount of 421,230 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September
30, 2023 we received 101,823 of net cash advances from Sanovas. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 634,635 and 161,642 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
primarily attributable to proceeds from advances from related parties and Sanovas of 161,642 in the nine months ended September 30,
2023, and the sale of common stock of 405,043, exercise of stock options of 210,000 and proceeds from advances from related parties
of 19,592 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases
it estimates on historical experience and on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimation process often
may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that falls
within that range of reasonable estimates. Estimates are used in areas including, but not limited to: research and development expense
recognition, valuation of stock options, allowances of deferred tax assets, accrued expenses and liabilities, and cash flow assumptions
regarding going concern considerations. 

20 

Stock-based
Compensation 

Stock-based
compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees. We measure stock-based compensation costs at the
grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) over the vesting period.
Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from the original
estimates. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The cost is recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations based on the employees respective function. The fair value of common stock was determined based upon
the sale of common stock to third parties pursuant to the offering which commenced in 2019, which offering continued through January
2022. 

The
risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining
term commensurate with the expected term of the award. Management has estimated expected volatility based on similar comparable industry
sector averages. Expected life of the option represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding. The estimate for dividend
yield is 0 because we have not historically paid and does not intend to pay a dividend on its common stock in the foreseeable future. 

Allocated
costs from Sanovas 

A
substantial portion of our expenses are costs and expenses paid by Sanovas and costs and expenses allocated to us by Sanovas. We expect
that to continue until we have sufficient resources to build our own team and infrastructure to support our operations. The allocations
our payroll related expenses are based upon the estimated percentage of effort incurred by each employee on operations. Allocation of
non-payroll related expenses are based upon whether the expense related to our operations. 

Income
taxes 

We
account for income taxes using the asset-and-liability method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes .
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rate is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance has been recorded for all of the deferred tax
assets. 

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards 

The
following pronouncement may have an impact on the accounting policies of the Company: 

A
variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard-setting organizations. Due to the
tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, management has not determined whether the implementation of such proposed
standards would be material to our consolidated financial statements . 

JOBS
Act 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. For as long
as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we also intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive
compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). We will remain an emerging growth company
until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds
 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues
of 1.325 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt in a
three-year period or (iv) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act.

ITEM
3. QUANTATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

The
information under this Item is not required to be provided by smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls 

We
are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that
are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation based on the criteria in Internal
Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based upon that evaluation, due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to a lack of segregation
of duties, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2024. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that a reasonable
possibility exists that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We
are considering various remediation measures, including hiring internal accounting resources or using outside providers to provide additional
resources and capabilities as well as implementing a more formal accounting and financial reporting system to mitigate such material
weakness, but have not yet adopted or implemented any such measures. When we have sufficient business activity and funding available,
we intend to begin to implement remediation measures to address our material weakness and improve our internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We hope to complete the implementation, remediation and test of the new procedures
in the 2025, as resources permit us to spend time and money on building finance infrastructure. 

Management
is actively engaged in the planning for, and implementation of, remediation efforts to address our material weakness and improve our
internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are developing procedures for the most critically-needed
processes that we hope to have implemented by the end of the year. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

22 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to
any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Our
business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations
and the trading price of our securities. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed
in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the
 Annual Report ). Except as described below, our risk factors as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have not
changed materially from those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report. 

Risks
Relating to Our Business 

We
have generated no revenue from commercial sales to date and our future profitability is uncertain. 

We
were incorporated in November 2017 and have a limited operating history, and our business is subject to all of the risks inherent in
the establishment of a new business enterprise. Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties,
complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with development and expansion of a new business enterprise. Since inception,
we have incurred losses and expect to continue to operate at a net loss for at least the next several years. Our net losses for the years
ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were 2,090,889 and 3,913,990, respectively, and our accumulated deficit as of December
31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 11,109,195 and 9,018,306, respectively. Our net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, were 3,453,800 and 1,549,253, respectively, and our accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was 14,562,995. There can
be no assurance that the products under development by us will be cleared for sale in the U.S. or elsewhere. Furthermore, there can be
no assurance that if such products are cleared they will be successfully commercialized, and the extent of our future losses and the
timing of our profitability are highly uncertain. If we are unable to achieve profitability, we may be unable to continue our operations. 

There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 79,089 and liabilities of 1,943,169. As of the date of this report, we do not have adequate resources
to fund our operations beyond December 2024 without considering any future capital raising transactions. We will need to raise additional
funding to complete the development of its products and commence the market launch, assuming regulatory approval is obtained. We do not
know whether additional financing will be available when needed, whether it will be available on favorable terms, or if it will be available
at all. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In the event that we are unable to obtain
additional financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional
financing. Changes in our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, costs related to legal proceedings we
might become subject to in the future, the acceleration or modification of our development activities, any near-term or future expansion
plans, increased expenses, potential acquisitions or other events may further affect our ability to continue as a going concern. Similarly,
the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023 includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If
we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in us. 

Failure
to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley could cause our
financial reports to be inaccurate. 

We
are required pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, to maintain internal control over financial reporting
and to assess and report on the effectiveness of those controls. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified
by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Although we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, our internal accounting controls may not meet all standards applicable to companies
with publicly traded securities. If we fail to implement any required improvements to our disclosure controls and procedures, we may
be obligated to report control deficiencies, in which case we could become subject to regulatory sanction or investigation. Further,
such an outcome could damage investor confidence in the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements. 

Our
management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were, and continue to be, ineffective, and as of September
30, 2024 as a result of a material weakness in our internal controls due to the lack of segregation of duties. While management is working
to remediate the material weakness, there is no assurance that such changes, when economically feasible and sustainable, will remediate
the identified material weaknesses or that the controls will prevent or detect future material weaknesses. If we are not able to maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting, our financial statements, including related disclosures, may be inaccurate, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business.
