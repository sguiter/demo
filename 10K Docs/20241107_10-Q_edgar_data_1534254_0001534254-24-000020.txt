Note 1. 
 , or the minimum offering requirement, and commenced operations. The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the 1940 Act. The Company elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. 
 The Company s investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation for investors. The Company s portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured debt, including first lien loans, second lien loans and unitranche loans, and, to a lesser extent, collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, unsecured debt, and equity, of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies. 
 The Company is managed by CION Investment Management, LLC, or CIM, a registered investment adviser and an affiliate of the Company. Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Company, CIM oversees the management of the Company s activities and is responsible for making investment decisions for the Company s investment portfolio. On August 6, 2024, the board of directors of the Company, including a majority of the board of directors who are not interested persons, approved the renewal of the second amended and restated investment advisory agreement with CIM for a period of , commencing August 9, 2024. The Company has also entered into an administration agreement with CIM to provide the Company with administrative services necessary for it to operate. The Company and CIM previously engaged Apollo Investment Management, L.P., or AIM, a subsidiary of Apollo Global Management, Inc., or, together with its subsidiaries, Apollo, a leading global alternative investment manager, to act as the Company s investment sub-adviser. 
 On July 11, 2017, the members of CIM entered into a third amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CIM, or the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement, for the purpose of creating a joint venture between AIM and CION Investment Group, LLC, or CIG, an affiliate of the Company. Under the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement, AIM became a member of CIM and was issued a newly-created class of membership interests in CIM pursuant to which AIM, among other things, shares in the profits, losses, distributions and expenses of CIM with the other members in accordance with the terms of the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement, which results in CIG and AIM each owning a economic interest in CIM. 
 On July 10, 2017, the Company s independent directors unanimously approved the termination of the investment sub-advisory agreement with AIM, effective as of July 11, 2017. Although the investment sub-advisory agreement and AIM's engagement as the Company s investment sub-adviser were terminated, AIM continues to perform certain services for CIM and the Company. AIM is not paid a separate fee in exchange for such services, but is entitled to receive distributions as a member of CIM as described above. 
 On December 4, 2017, the members of CIM entered into a fourth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CIM, or the Fourth Amended CIM LLC Agreement, under which AIM performs certain services for CIM, which include, among other services, providing (a) trade and settlement support; (b) portfolio and cash reconciliation; (c) market pipeline information regarding syndicated deals, in each case, as reasonably requested by CIM; and (d) monthly valuation reports and support for all broker-quoted investments. AIM may also, from time to time, provide the Company with access to potential investment opportunities made available on Apollo's credit platform on a similar basis as other third-party market participants. All of the Company's investment decisions are the sole responsibility of, and are made at the sole discretion of, CIM's investment committee, which consists entirely of CIG senior personnel. 
 The amended and restated investment advisory agreement was approved by shareholders on August 9, 2021 at the Company s reconvened 2021 annual meeting of shareholders. As a result, on August 10, 2021, the Company and CIM entered into the amended and restated investment advisory agreement in order to implement the change to the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee payable from the Company to CIM that expresses the hurdle rate required for CIM to earn, and be paid, the incentive fee as a percentage of the Company s net assets rather than adjusted capital.

 Short Term Investments 
 Short term investments include an investment in a U.S. Treasury obligations fund, which seeks to provide current income and daily liquidity by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements that are collateralized by such securities. The Company had and of such investments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are included in investments, at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and on the consolidated schedules of investments. 
 Income Taxes 
 of the Company s wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, CIC Holdco, LLC, or CIC Holdco, has elected to be treated as a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, CIC Holdco is not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense or benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of its ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense or benefit, if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, where material, are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. There were no deferred tax assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Book/tax differences relating to permanent differences are reclassified among the Company s capital accounts, as appropriate. Additionally, the tax character of distributions is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP (see Note 5). 
 Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
 The Company evaluates its tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by the taxing authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company did not have any uncertain tax positions during the periods presented herein. 
 The Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal, New York State, New York City and Maryland income tax jurisdictions for 2020, 2021 and 2022.

 Capital Gains Incentive Fee 
 Pursuant to the terms of the investment advisory agreement the Company entered into with CIM, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of the Company s investment portfolio during operations is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year. Prior to October 5, 2021 and under the investment advisory agreement, such fee equaled of the Company s incentive fee capital gains (i.e., the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. Pursuant to the second amended and restated investment advisory agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains was reduced to , which became effective on October 5, 2021. 
 On a cumulative basis and to the extent that all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation exceed realized capital gains as well as the aggregate realized net capital gains for which a fee has previously been paid, the Company would not be required to pay CIM a capital gains incentive fee. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period. 
 While the investment advisory agreement with CIM neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of the American Institute for Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, the Company accrues capital gains incentive fees on unrealized gains. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to CIM if the Company s entire investment portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though CIM is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.

shares of common stock for net proceeds of . The net proceeds include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of , for which the Company issued shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock repurchased of , for which the Company repurchased shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, shares of common stock repurchased had been retired. 
 On August 27, 2024, the Company's shareholders approved a proposal that authorizes the Company to issue shares of its common stock at prices below the then current NAV per share of the Company s common stock in one or more offerings for a -month period following such shareholder approval. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not issued any such shares. 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 In connection with the Listing of its shares of common stock on the NYSE, on September 15, 2021, the Company terminated its previous fifth amended and restated distribution reinvestment plan, or the Old DRP. The final distribution reinvestment under the Old DRP was made as part of the monthly base distribution paid on September 14, 2021. On September 15, 2021, the Company adopted a new distribution reinvestment plan, or the New DRP, which became effective as of the Listing and first applied to the reinvestment of distributions paid on December 8, 2021. For additional information regarding the terms of the New DRP, see Note 5. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 Effective on September 21, 2021, every two shares of the Company's common stock then issued and outstanding were automatically combined into one share of the Company's common stock, with the number of then issued and outstanding shares reduced from to . The reverse stock split amendment also provided that there was no change in the par value of per share as a result of the reverse stock split. In addition, the reverse stock split did not modify the rights or preferences of the Company s common stock. 
 Listing and Fractional Shares 
 On October 5, 2021, the Company's shares of common stock commenced trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol CION . As approved by shareholders on September 7, 2021, the Listing was staggered such that (i) up to 1/3rd of shares held by all shareholders were available for trading upon Listing, (ii) up to 2/3rd of shares held by all shareholders were available for trading starting days after Listing, or April 4, 2022, and (iii) all shares were available for trading starting days after Listing, or July 5, 2022. The Company eliminated all then outstanding fractional shares of its common stock in connection with the Listing, as permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, on July 14, 2022. On February 26, 2023, the Company s shares of common stock also listed and commenced trading in Israel on the TASE under the ticker symbol CION . 
 Pre-Listing Share Repurchase Program 
 Historically, the Company offered to repurchase shares on a quarterly basis on such terms as determined by the Company s board of directors in its complete and absolute discretion unless, in the judgment of the independent directors of the Company s board of directors, such repurchases would not have been in the best interests of the Company s shareholders or would have violated applicable law. 
 On July 30, 2021, the Company's board of directors, including the independent directors, determined to suspend the Company's pre-Listing share repurchase program commencing with the third quarter of 2021 in anticipation of the Listing and the concurrent enhanced liquidity the Listing was expected to provide. The pre-Listing share repurchase program ultimately terminated upon the Listing and the Company does not expect to implement a new quarterly share repurchase program in the future. 
 Historically, the Company generally limited the number of shares to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of shares it could have repurchased with the proceeds it received from the issuance of shares pursuant to the Old DRP.

 CIM Investment adviser Incentive fees(1) CIM Administrative services provider Administrative services expense(1) 
 (1) Amounts charged directly to operations. 
 The Company has entered into an investment advisory agreement with CIM. On August 6, 2024, the board of directors of the Company, including a majority of the board of directors who are not interested persons, approved the renewal of the second amended and restated investment advisory agreement with CIM for a period of , commencing August 9, 2024. Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement in effect prior to the Listing, CIM was paid an annual base management fee equal to of the average value of the Company s gross assets, less cash and cash equivalents, and an incentive fee based on the Company s performance, as described below. Pursuant to the second amended and restated investment advisory agreement, which was effective upon the Listing on October 5, 2021, the annual base management fee was reduced to of the average value of the Company s gross assets (including cash pledged as collateral for the Company s secured financing arrangements, but excluding other cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets), to the extent that the Company s asset coverage ratio is greater than or equal to (i.e., 1 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity); provided that, the annual base management fee will be reduced further to for any such gross assets purchased with leverage resulting in the Company s asset coverage ratio dropping below . On December 30, 2021, shareholders approved a proposal to reduce the Company s asset coverage ratio to . As a result, commencing on December 31, 2021, the Company is required to maintain asset coverage for its senior securities of (i.e., 2 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity) rather than . The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the two most recently completed calendar quarters. 
 The incentive fee consists of parts. The first part, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter and was subject to a hurdle rate, measured quarterly and expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital, as defined in the investment advisory agreement in effect prior to the Listing, equal to per quarter, or an annualized rate of . Under the investment advisory agreement in effect prior to the Listing, the Company paid to CIM of pre-incentive fee net investment income once the hurdle rate was exceeded until the annualized rate of was exceeded, at which point the Company paid to CIM of all pre-incentive fee net investment income that exceeded the annualized rate of . Under the amended and restated investment advisory agreement also in effect prior to the Listing, the change to the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee payable to CIM that expresses the hurdle rate required for CIM to earn, and be paid, the incentive fee as a percentage of the Company's net assets rather than adjusted capital was implemented. Under the second amended and restated investment advisory agreement, the hurdle rate was reduced to per quarter, or an annualized rate of , and the Company pays to CIM of pre-incentive fee net investment income once the hurdle rate is exceeded until the annualized rate of is exceeded, at which point the Company pays to CIM of all pre-incentive fee net investment income. These changes to the subordinated incentive fee on income were effective upon the Listing, except for the change to the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee payable to CIM that replaced adjusted capital with the Company's net assets, which was effective on August 10, 2021. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded subordinated incentive fees on income of and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded subordinated incentive fees on income of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liabilities recorded for subordinated incentive fees were and , respectively. The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the capital gains incentive fee, is described in Note 2. 
 The Company accrues the capital gains incentive fee based on net realized gains and net unrealized appreciation; however, under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, the fee payable to CIM is based on net realized gains and unrealized depreciation and no such fee is payable with respect to unrealized appreciation unless and until such appreciation is actually realized. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had no liability for and did not record any capital gains incentive fees.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total liability payable to CIM and its affiliates was and , respectively, which primarily related to fees earned by CIM during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 In the event that CIM undertakes to provide investment advisory services to other clients in the future, it will strive to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with the Company s investment objective and strategies so that the Company will not be disadvantaged in relation to any other client of the investment adviser or its senior management team. However, it is currently possible that some investment opportunities will be provided to other clients of CIM rather than to the Company. 
 Indemnifications 
 The investment advisory agreement and the administration agreement each provide certain indemnifications from the Company to the other relevant parties to such agreements. The Company s maximum exposure under these agreements is unknown. However, the Company has not experienced claims or losses pursuant to these agreements and believes the risk of loss related to such indemnifications to be remote.

 On November 4, 2024, the Company s co-chief executive officers declared a quarterly base distribution of per share for the fourth quarter of 2024 payable on December 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024. 
 In connection with the Listing of its shares of common stock on the NYSE, on September 15, 2021, the Company terminated the Old DRP. The final distribution reinvestment under the Old DRP was made as part of the monthly base distribution paid on September 14, 2021. On September 15, 2021, the Company adopted the New DRP, which became effective as of the Listing and first applied to the reinvestment of distributions paid on December 8, 2021. 
 Under the Old DRP and prior to the Listing, distributions to participating shareholders who opted in to the Old DRP were reinvested in additional shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price equal to the estimated NAV per share of common stock as of the date of issuance. 
 Upon the Listing, all shareholders were automatically enrolled in the New DRP and will receive distributions as declared by the Company in additional shares of its common stock unless such shareholder affirmatively elects to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying (i) such shareholder s financial adviser; or (ii) if such shareholder has a registered account maintained at the Company s transfer agent, the plan administrator. With respect to distributions to participating shareholders under the New DRP, the Company reserves the right to either issue new shares or cause the plan administrator to purchase shares in the open market in connection with implementation of the New DRP. Unless the Company, in its sole discretion, otherwise directs DST Asset Management Solutions, Inc., the plan administrator, (A) if the per share market price (as defined in the New DRP) is equal to or greater than the estimated NAV per share on the payment date for the distribution, then the Company will issue shares at the greater of (i) the estimated NAV or (ii) of the market price, or (B) if the market price is less than the estimated NAV, then, in the Company s sole discretion, (i) shares will be purchased in open market transactions for the accounts of participating shareholders to the extent practicable, or (ii) the Company will issue shares at the estimated NAV. Pursuant to the terms of the New DRP, the number of shares to be issued to a participating shareholder will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to a participating shareholder by the price per share at which the Company issues such shares; provided, however, that shares purchased in open market transactions by the plan administrator will be allocated to a participating shareholder based on the weighted average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares purchased in the open market with respect to such distribution. 
 If a shareholder receives distributions in the form of common stock pursuant to the New DRP, such shareholder generally will be subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as if they elected to receive distributions in cash. If the Company s common stock is trading at or below NAV, a shareholder receiving distributions in the form of additional common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of cash that such shareholder would have received if they had elected to receive the distribution in cash. If the Company s common stock is trading above NAV, a shareholder receiving distributions in the form of additional common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of the fair market value of the Company s common stock. The shareholder s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of common stock received in a distribution will be equal to the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to the shareholder. Any stock received in a distribution will have a holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares of common stock are credited to the shareholder s account.

 The Company may fund its distributions to shareholders from any sources of funds available to the Company, including borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, and dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. Any such distributions can only be sustained if the Company maintains positive investment performance in future periods. There can be no assurances that the Company will maintain such performance in order to sustain these distributions or be able to pay distributions at all. On December 31, 2021, the Company and CIM allowed the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement to expire in accordance with its terms. As a result, CIM has no obligation to provide expense support to the Company in future periods. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to pay distributions.

 The Company will fund its unfunded commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its investment commitments that are funded at the time they are made (i.e., advances from its financing arrangements and/or cash flows from operations). The Company will not fund its unfunded commitments from future net proceeds generated by securities offerings, if any. The Company follows a process to manage its liquidity and ensure that it has available capital to fund its unfunded commitments. Specifically, the Company prepares detailed analyses of the level of its unfunded commitments relative to its then available liquidity on a daily basis. These analyses are reviewed and discussed on a weekly basis by the Company's executive officers and senior members of CIM (including members of the investment committee) and are updated on a real time basis in order to ensure that the Company has adequate liquidity to satisfy its unfunded commitments.

 (2) The amount shown for net realized loss, net change in unrealized depreciation on investments and loss on foreign currency is the balancing figure derived from the other figures in the schedule. The amount shown at this caption for a share outstanding throughout the period may not agree with the change in the aggregate gains and losses in portfolio securities for the period because of the timing of sales and repurchases of the Company s shares in relation to fluctuating market values for the portfolio. As a result, net increase in net assets resulting from operations in this schedule may vary from the consolidated statements of operations. 
 (3) Repurchases of common stock may have caused an incremental decrease or increase in net asset value per share due to the repurchase of shares at a price in excess of or below net asset value per share, respectively, on each repurchase date. The per share impact of repurchases of common stock was a decrease to net asset value of less than per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023.

The total investment return-net asset value calculation assumes that distributions are reinvested in accordance with the Company's distribution reinvestment plan then in effect as described in Note 5. The total investment return-net asset value does not consider the effect of the sales load from the sale of the Company s common stock. The total investment return-net asset value includes the effect of the issuance of shares at a net offering price that is greater than net asset value per share, which causes an increase in net asset value per share. Total returns covering less than a full year are not annualized. 
 (5) Total investment return-market value for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023 was calculated by taking the change in the market price of the Company's common stock since the first day of the period, and including the impact of distributions reinvested in accordance with the Company s New DRP. Total investment return-market value does not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of the Company s common stock. The historical calculation of total investment return-market value in the table should not be considered a representation of the Company s future total return based on market value, which may be greater or less than the return shown in the table due to a number of factors, including the Company s ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the level of the Company s expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which the Company encounters competition in its markets, general economic conditions and fluctuations in per share market value.

 Overview

We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Code. 
 On October 5, 2021, shares of our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol CION . The Listing accomplished our goal of providing our shareholders with greatly enhanced liquidity. On February 26, 2023, our shares of common stock and our Series A Notes listed and commenced trading in Israel on the TASE under the ticker symbol CION and "CION B1", respectively. On October 9, 2024, our 2029 Notes listed and commenced trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol CICB .

On August 6, 2024, our board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons, approved the renewal of the second amended and restated investment advisory agreement with CIM for a period of twelve months, commencing August 9, 2024. We have also entered into an administration agreement with CIM to provide us with administrative services necessary for us to operate. We and CIM previously engaged AIM to act as our investment sub-adviser. 
 On July 11, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement for the purpose of creating a joint venture between AIM and CIG. Under the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement, AIM became a member of CIM and was issued a newly-created class of membership interests in CIM pursuant to which AIM, among other things, shares in the profits, losses, distributions and expenses of CIM with the other members in accordance with the terms of the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement, which results in CIG and AIM each owning a 50 economic interest in CIM. 
 On July 10, 2017, our independent directors unanimously approved the termination of the investment sub-advisory agreement with AIM, effective as of July 11, 2017, as part of the new and ongoing relationship among us, CIM and AIM. Although the investment sub-advisory agreement and AIM's engagement as our investment sub-adviser were terminated, AIM continues to perform certain services for CIM and us. AIM is not paid a separate fee in exchange for such services, but is entitled to receive distributions as a member of CIM as described above. 
 68 

On December 4, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the Fourth Amended CIM LLC Agreement under which AIM performs certain services for CIM, which include, among other services, providing (a) trade and settlement support; (b) portfolio and cash reconciliation; (c) market pipeline information regarding syndicated deals, in each case, as reasonably requested by CIM; and (d) monthly valuation reports and support for all broker-quoted investments. AIM may also, from time to time, provide us with access to potential investment opportunities made available on Apollo's credit platform on a similar basis as other third-party market participants. All of our investment decisions are the sole responsibility of, and are made at the sole discretion of, CIM's investment committee, which consists entirely of CIG senior personnel. 
 Upon the occurrence of the Listing on October 5, 2021, we and CIM entered into the second amended and restated investment advisory agreement in order to implement the changes to the advisory fees payable from us to CIM that (i) reduced the annual base management fee, (ii) amended the structure of the subordinated incentive fee on income payable from us to CIM and reduced the hurdle and incentive fee rates, and (iii) reduced the incentive fee on capital gains payable from us to CIM (as described in further detail in Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). 
 We seek to meet our investment objective by utilizing the experienced management team of CIM, which includes its access to the relationships and human capital of its affiliates in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, as well as monitoring and servicing our investments. We focus primarily on the senior secured debt of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies, which we define as companies that generally possess annual EBITDA of 75 million or less, with experienced management teams, significant free cash flow, strong competitive positions and potential for growth. 
 Revenue 
 We primarily generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we hold and capital gains on debt or other equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies. The majority of our senior debt investments bear interest at a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or monthly. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued, but unpaid, interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and capital structuring fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized when earned. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses are the payment of management fees and subordinated incentive fees on income under the investment advisory agreement and interest expense on our financing arrangements. Our investment advisory fees compensate CIM for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions. 
 Recent Developments 
 Q4 Base Distribution 
 
 On November 4, 2024, our co-chief executive officers declared a quarterly base distribution of 0.36 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, payable on December 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024. 
 2029 Notes 
 
 On October 3, 2024, we issued and sold 172,500 in aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes, which includes 22,500 in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes issued and sold pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters option to purchase additional 2029 Notes to cover overallotments. The 2029 Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture between us and the Trustee. We used the net proceeds of the offering of the 2029 Notes to pay down borrowings under our senior secured credit facility with JPM. The 2029 Notes began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol CICB on October 9, 2024. 
 
 The 2029 Notes will mature on December 30, 2029, unless previously redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The interest rate of the 2029 Notes is 7.50 per year and will be paid quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30 of each year, commencing December 30, 2024. The 2029 Notes are our direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with our existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness; senior to any series of preferred stock that we may issue in the future; senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2029 Notes; effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our existing or future subsidiaries. 
 69 

The 2029 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 30, 2026, upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days written notice by mail prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof, at a redemption price of 25 per 2029 Note plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to the date fixed for redemption. 
 
 The Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with the asset coverage ratio requirements set forth in the 1940 Act, but giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC, and certain other exceptions, and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2029 Notes and the Trustee if we should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 
 The 2029 Notes were offered and sold in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form N-2 (Registration No. 333-278658) previously filed with the SEC, as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated September 26, 2024 and a final prospectus supplement dated September 26, 2024.

 Our investment portfolio may contain senior secured investments that are in the form of lines of credit, delayed draw term loans, revolving credit facilities, or unfunded commitments, which may require us to provide funding when requested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our unfunded commitments amounted to 71,113 and 47,349, respectively. As of October 30, 2024, our unfunded commitments amounted to 69,980. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. Refer to the section Commitments and Contingencies for further details on our unfunded commitments. 
 
 Investment Portfolio Asset Quality 
 CIM uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. These ratings are just one of several factors that CIM uses to monitor our portfolio, are not in and of themselves determinative of fair value or revenue recognition and are presented for indicative purposes. CIM rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. 
 72 

The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating used in this ratings system: 
 Investment Rating Description 1 Indicates the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 2 Indicates a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing in accordance with our analysis of its business and the full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. 3 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased since origination or acquisition, but full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. A portfolio company with an investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. 4 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased significantly since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and noncompliance with debt covenants, and we expect some loss of interest, dividend or capital appreciation, but still expect an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment. 5 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. Loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment is expected, which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment. 
 For investments rated 3, 4, or 5, CIM enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
 The following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio based on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, excluding short term investments of 53,503 and 113,446, respectively: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Investment Rating Investments Fair Value Percentage of Investment Portfolio Investments Fair Value Percentage of Investment Portfolio 1 10,429 0.6 98,255 5.3 2 1,501,302 85.7 1,603,975 87.2 3 207,168 11.8 120,132 6.5 4 26,920 1.5 10,304 0.6 5 6,907 0.4 8,158 0.4 1,752,726 100.0 1,840,824 100.0 
 The amount of the investment portfolio in each rating category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of such portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the rating of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.

 Investment Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated investment income of 59,627 and 67,540, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured debt, collateralized securities and structured products, and unsecured debt of 99 and 101 portfolio companies held during each respective period. The decrease in total investment income was primarily driven by a decrease in transaction fees on investments received during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 74 

Operating Expenses and Income Taxes 
 The composition of our operating expenses and income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

 The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher average borrowings under our financing arrangements during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in subordinated incentive fee on income was primarily the result of the decrease in investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The composition of our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

 75 

Net Change in Unrealized (Depreciation) Appreciation on Investments 
 The net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on our investments totaled (25,935) and 25,606 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This change was primarily due to the decline in fair value of certain investments from mark-to-market adjustments during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net (Decrease) Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We generate cash primarily from cash flows from interest, fees and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We also employ leverage to seek to enhance our returns as market conditions permit and at the discretion of CIM and pursuant to the 1940 Act. As a result, we also generate cash from our existing financing arrangements and may generate cash from future borrowings, as well as future offerings of securities including public and/or private issuances of debt and/or equity securities. We use cash primarily to (i) purchase investments in new and existing portfolio companies, (ii) pay for the cost of operations (including paying advisory fees to and reimbursing CIM), (iii) make debt service payments related to any of our financing arrangements and (iv) pay cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 77 

On March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum asset coverage ratio from 200 to 150 and, as a result, to potentially increase the ratio of a BDC s debt to equity from a maximum of 1-to-1 to a maximum of 2-to-1, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. As a result of receiving shareholder approval on December 30, 2021, effective December 31, 2021, we are required to maintain asset coverage for our senior securities of 150 rather than 200 , which allows us to increase the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur. We may from time to time enter into additional financing arrangements or amend the size of our existing financing arrangements. Any increase to our leverage would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 1.78 and 1.81, respectively. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage and liquidity requirements. 
 
 On August 27, 2024, our shareholders authorized us to issue shares of our common stock at prices below the then current NAV per share in one or more offerings for a 12-month period following such shareholder approval. As of the date of this report, we are not engaged in discussions to, or have any intent to, issue any such shares. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 29,765 and short term investments of 53,503 invested in a fund that primarily invests in U.S. government securities. Cash and short term investments as of September 30, 2024, taken together with the undrawn debt available under our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing and financing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we had 162 million available under our secured financing arrangements. 
 
 Our short-term cash needs include the funding of additional portfolio investments, the payment of operating expenses including interest expense, management fees, incentive fees, administrative services expense and general and administrative expenses, as well as paying distributions to our shareholders. Our long-term cash needs will include principal payments on outstanding financing arrangements and funding of additional portfolio investments. Funding for short and long-term cash needs will come from cash provided from operating activities and/or unused net proceeds from financing activities. We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy our short and long-term cash requirements. We cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to us in sufficient amounts in the future. 
 
 Post-Listing Share Repurchase Policy 
 
 On September 15, 2021, our board of directors, including the independent directors, approved a share repurchase policy authorizing us to repurchase up to 50 million of our outstanding common stock after the Listing. On June 24, 2022, our board of directors, including the independent directors, increased the amount of shares of our common stock that may be repurchased under the share repurchase policy by 10 million to up to an aggregate of 60 million. Under the share repurchase policy, we may purchase shares of our common stock through various means such as open market transactions, including block purchases, and privately negotiated transactions. The number of shares repurchased and the timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion. Factors include, but are not limited to, share price, trading volume and general market conditions, along with our general business conditions. The policy may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares of our common stock. 
 
 On August 19, 2024, as part of the share repurchase policy, we entered into a new trading plan with an independent broker, Wells Fargo, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based in part on historical trading data with respect to our shares. The 10b5-1 trading plan permits common stock to be repurchased at a time that we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-imposed trading restrictions. The 10b5-1 trading plan expires on August 19, 2025, and is subject to price, market volume and timing restrictions. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 824,750 shares under the 10b5-1 trading plan for an aggregate purchase price of 9,344, or an average purchase price of 11.33 per share. 
 From October 1, 2024 to October 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 73,943 shares of common stock under the 10b5-1 trading plan for an aggregate purchase price of 881, or an average purchase price of 11.92 per share. From the inception of the 10b5-1 trading plan in August 2022 through October 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 3,672,497 shares of common stock under the 10b5-1 trading plan for an aggregate purchase price of 37,187, or an average purchase price of 10.13 per share.

RIC Status and Distributions 
 To qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute in respect of each taxable year at least 90 of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. We will incur an excise tax of 4 imposed on RICs to the extent we do not distribute in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98.0 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income from preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no federal income tax. For an additional discussion of our RIC status and distributions, refer to Note 2 and Note 5, respectively, of our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 We intend to make distributions in an amount sufficient to maintain RIC status each year and to avoid any federal income taxes on income. Therefore, subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, we intend to authorize, declare, and pay base distributions on a quarterly basis. Base and any supplemental and/or special distributions in respect of future periods will be evaluated by management and our board of directors based on circumstances and expectations existing at the time of consideration. 
 The following table presents distributions per share that were declared during the year ended December 31, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Distributions Three Months Ended Per Share Amount 2023 March 31, 2023 (one record date) 0.34 18,687 June 30, 2023 (one record date) 0.34 18,614 September 30, 2023 (two record dates) 0.39 21,276 December 31, 2023 (three record dates) 0.54 29,290 Total distributions for the year ended December 31, 2023 1.61 87,867 2024 March 31, 2024 (one record date) 0.34 18,279 June 30, 2024 (two record dates) 0.41 21,960 September 30, 2024 (one record date) 0.36 19,234 Total distributions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 1.11 59,473 
 
 On November 4, 2024, our co-chief executive officers declared a quarterly base distribution of 0.36 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024 payable on December 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of certain recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us. 
 80 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we also utilize available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming our estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. 
 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The value of our assets is determined quarterly and at such other times that an event occurs that materially affects the valuation. The valuation is made pursuant to Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, which requires that we value our assets as follows: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) for all other securities and assets, at fair value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a BDC, Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act requires the board of directors to determine in good faith the fair value of portfolio securities for which a market price is not readily available, and it does so in conjunction with the application of our valuation procedures by CIM. In accordance with Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, our board of directors has designated CIM as our valuation designee. Our board of directors and the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised solely of our independent directors, oversees the activities, methodology and processes of the valuation designee. 
 There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each asset while employing a valuation process that is consistently followed. Determinations of fair value involve subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Valuation Methods 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, CIM, as the valuation designee of our board of directors, undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 our quarterly valuation process generally begins with each portfolio company or investment either being sent directly to an independent valuation firm or initially valued by certain of CIM s investment professionals and certain members of its management team, with such valuation taking into account information received from various sources, including independent valuation firms, if applicable; 
 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with members of CIM s management team; 
 designated members of CIM s management team review the preliminary valuation, and, if applicable, deliver such preliminary valuation to an independent valuation firm for its review; 
 designated members of CIM s management team and, if appropriate, the relevant investment professionals meet with the independent valuation firm to discuss the preliminary valuation; 
 designated members of CIM s management team respond and supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the independent valuation firm; 
 our audit committee meets with members of CIM s management team and the independent valuation firms to discuss the assistance provided and the results of the independent valuation firms' review; and 
 our board of directors and our audit committee provide oversight with respect to this valuation process, including requesting such materials as they may determine appropriate. 
 We shall promptly (but no later than five business days after we become aware) report to our board of directors in writing on the occurrence of matters that materially affect the fair value of the designated portfolio of investments. Material matters in this instance include a significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or effectiveness of CIM s fair value determination process resulting in a material error in the calculation of NAV of 0.01 per share or greater. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing, certain investments for which a market price is not readily available are evaluated on a quarterly basis by an independent valuation firm and certain other investments are on a rotational basis reviewed by an independent valuation firm. Finally, certain investments are not evaluated by an independent valuation firm unless certain aspects of such investments in the aggregate meet certain criteria. 
 81 

Given the expected types of investments, excluding short term investments and stock of publicly traded companies that are classified as Level 1, management expects our portfolio holdings to be classified as Level 3. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process, particularly for Level 3 investments, such fair value estimates may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses that we ultimately realize on these investments to materially differ from the valuations currently assigned. Inputs used in the valuation process are subject to variability in the future and can result in materially different fair values. 
 For an additional discussion of our investment valuation process, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

 We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, except for those discussed in Note 7 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 82 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 81.2 of our investments paid variable interest rates. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments, especially to the extent that we hold variable rate investments, and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. To the extent that a majority of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates could make it easier for us to meet or exceed our incentive fee hurdle rate, as defined in our investment advisory agreement, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income, and also to the amount of incentive fees payable to CIM with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, under the terms of the JPM Fifth Amendment, advances bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month SOFR, plus a credit spread of 2.55 per year, and we will pay an annual administration fee of 0.20 on JPM s total financing commitment. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended UBS Facility, we currently pay a financing fee equal to the three-month SOFR, plus a spread of 3.20 per year. Pursuant to the terms of the Deed of Trust, the Series A Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to average overnight SOFR, plus a credit spread of 3.82 per year. The 2027 Notes (Tranche A) bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month SOFR plus a credit spread of 4.75 per year and are subject to a 2.00 SOFR floor. The 2027 Notes (Tranche B) bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month SOFR plus a credit spread of 3.90 per year and are subject to a 2.00 SOFR floor. Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Term Loan, advances bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month SOFR, plus a credit spread of 3.50 per year and subject to a 1.0 SOFR floor. Pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Term Loan, advances bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month SOFR, plus a credit spread of 3.80 per year and subject to a 4.0 SOFR floor. In addition, we may seek to further borrow funds in order to make additional investments. Our net investment income will be impacted, in part, by the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we would be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we have debt outstanding, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments. We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and long-term debt. Our interest rate risk management techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The following table shows the effect over a twelve month period of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, excluding short term investments, assuming no changes in our investment portfolio, the JPM Fifth Amendment, the Amended UBS Facility, the Series A Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2022 Term Loan or the 2024 Term Loan in effect as of September 30, 2024: 
 Basis Point Change in Interest Rates (Decrease) Increase in Net Interest Income(1) Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Down 300 basis points (14,192) (14.7) Down 200 basis points (9,807) (10.2) Down 100 basis points (4,985) (5.2) Down 50 basis points (2,504) (2.6) No change to current base rate (4.98 as of September 30, 2024) 
 Up 50 basis points 2,504 2.6 Up 100 basis points 5,008 5.2 Up 200 basis points 10,017 10.4 Up 300 basis points 15,025 15.6 
 (1) This table assumes no change in defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months. 
 The interest rate sensitivity analysis presented above does not consider the potential impact of the changes in fair value of our fixed rate debt investments, our fixed rate borrowings (the 2026 Notes), or the NAV of our common stock in the event of sudden changes in interest rates. Approximately 6.0 of our investments paid fixed interest rates as of September 30, 2024. Rising market interest rates will most likely lead to fair value declines for fixed interest rate investments and fixed interest rate borrowings and a decline in the net asset value of our common stock, while declining market interest rates will most likely lead to an increase in the fair value of fixed interest rate investments and fixed interest rate borrowings and an increase in the NAV of our common stock. 
 In addition, we may have risk regarding portfolio valuation as discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Inflation 
 Economic activity has continued to accelerate across sectors and regions. Nevertheless, due to geopolitical events, a rise in energy prices and strong consumer demand, inflation is showing signs of remaining high in the U.S. and globally. Although the current outlook is uncertain, heightened inflation may persist in the near to medium-term, particularly in the U.S., with the possibility that monetary policy may tighten in response. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect our portfolio companies' respective profit margins. 
 83 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on the foregoing evaluation, the Co-Chief Executive Officers and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Disclosure controls and procedures cannot detect or prevent all error and fraud. Some inherent limitations in disclosure controls and procedures include costs of implementation, faulty decision-making, simple error and mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all anticipated and unanticipated future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with established policies or procedures. 
 Evaluation of internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 84 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies and other third parties. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
