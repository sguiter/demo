Upon the prepayment of a loan, prepayment premiums and any unamortized fees are recorded as interest income. The Fund has loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind PIK provisions. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is generally recorded as interest income on an accrual basis. On the specified capitalization date, PIK interest is added to the principal balance and cost of the loan. Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that the principal or interest will be collected in full and the accrued interest is reversed against interest income. Interest payments received on debt investments on non-accrual status may be recognized as interest income or treated as a reduction of cost basis of the debt investment based on management s judgment of ultimate recovery and other considerations.

 such taxes withheld. The Fund conducts its business to the maximum extent practicable so that the Fund s activities do not create a taxable presence in any non-U.S. jurisdiction in which the Fund or the Adviser do not have offices. The Fund is subject to partnership audit rules enacted as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the Centralized Partnership Audit Regime ). Under the Centralized Partnership Audit Regime, any IRS audit of the Fund would be conducted at the Fund level rather than in separate proceedings involving each investor. Adjustments to partnership items will generally be determined at the Fund level, and the Fund may be required to pay taxes (and associated interest and penalties) imposed as a result of such adjustments. In certain cases, the Fund may be able to elect to have the tax assessed or collected at the investor level. In the event of an audit, these new rules, and any elections thereunder, may significantly affect the amount and timing of tax (and associated interest and penalties) that is required to be borne by the Fund and its investors, as well as the manner in which such amounts are allocated among its investors (including former investors). The Fund follows the authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions, and is required to determine whether a tax position of the Fund is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , there were liabilities related to accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. The Fund files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates and invests, if required. In the normal course of business, the Fund is subject to examination by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. The Fund may be subject to examination by such jurisdictions for all open tax years, the earliest of which is 2021. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties, when known, related to realized tax positions on the consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , there were material interest and penalties.

As applicable, following the completion of final distributions to Shareholders, the Adviser will pay to the Fund an aggregate amount equal to the Clawback Amount as of such date, subject to certain tax limitations as described in the governing Fund documents. The Clawback Amount is equal to (i) the cumulative Incentive Compensation received by the Adviser minus (ii) the product of 15 (adjusted for any waiver or reduction of Incentive Compensation paid) and the sum of the aggregate amount of cumulative net capital gains or losses (without giving consideration to any unrealized gains) and Pre-Incentive Compensation Net Investment Income generated since inception through the date of determination.

We use words such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, project, estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology to identify forward-looking statements. 
 We have based the forward-looking statements included in this report on information available to us on the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form 10, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Overview 
 The Fund was originally formed on July 31, 2014 as a Delaware limited partnership and started operations on July 1, 2015. The Fund converted into a statutory trust organized under the laws of the state of Maryland on November 15, 2021. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") and to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. 
 Investment Framework 
 We are a specialty finance company that is a closed-end management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. 

 44 

If we are successful in achieving our investment objective, we believe that we will be able to provide our Shareholders with consistent dividends and attractive risk-adjusted total returns, although there can be no assurances in this regard. Since we commenced investment operations on July 1, 2015, through September 30, 2024, we have invested approximately 3.6 billion in 251 portfolio companies, excluding any subsequent exits or repayments. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our portfolio was invested approximately 96.9 in first lien secured debt, 0.6 in second lien debt, 0.6 in subordinated and unsecured debt, 0.4 in equity investments and 1.5 in other investments. Relationship with our Adviser 
 Silver Point Specialty Credit Fund Management, LLC (the "Adviser"), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Silver Point Capital, L.P. ("Silver Point"), serves as our investment adviser and administrator (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details). Subject to the supervision of our Board of Trustees, our Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and management services. Our Adviser is responsible for sourcing, researching and structuring potential investments, monitoring portfolio companies, and providing operating and managerial assistance to us and to our portfolio companies as required. We believe our Adviser will be able to leverage Silver Point s existing relationships across advisors, intermediaries, investment banks, financial sponsors, broker-dealers, lawyers, and investors to source attractive investment opportunities. We seek to accomplish our investment objective through leveraging the Silver Point investment platform with 32.5 billion of investable assets (including leverage for applicable funds) and Silver Point s significant credit investing expertise, which enables us to source and identify less competitive and/or mispriced market opportunities. We target secured, floating rate loans with stable income that are structured with significant downside protection, which we believe includes strong covenant packages and comprehensive collateral packages. We prioritize investments in first lien debt, which we believe offers more attractive risk-adjusted return characteristics. We and our Adviser have obtained an exemptive order from the SEC to permit greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our Board of Trustees determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other affiliated funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on targeting direct lending opportunities to U.S. middle market companies throughout the business cycle. Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the prevailing economic and market environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, eligible portfolio companies include certain U.S. companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 Since formation, in excess of 70 of the Fund s assets have been qualifying assets under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Fund s total assets was comprised of approximately 82.7 of qualifying assets. 
 45 

Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on the investments we hold and, to a lesser extent, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and dividend income on direct equity investments. In addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees and prepayment fees. 
 Interest and dividend income are recorded on an accrual basis. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discounts or premiums are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts to income. We record contractual prepayment premiums and the acceleration of unamortized premiums or discounts on loans and debt securities as income, which can cause investment income to vary quarter by quarter. 
 Interest on debt investments is generally payable monthly or quarterly. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. Generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make voluntary prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. 
 We recognize realized gains or losses on sales of investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment at time of disposition, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recorded. We record changes in unrealized gain or loss on investments based on the current period changes in fair value of investments inclusive of the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the current period. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include interest and financing costs incurred from our credit facilities and the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Advisory Agreement. Additionally, we bear other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 investment advisory and management fees; 

expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Adviser, or members of our investment team, or payable to third parties, in respect of prospective or consummated investments; 

amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments, including legal, tax, consulting and other professional expenses; 

commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 

custodial fees; 

certain taxes; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; 

errors and omissions liability insurance for Trustees and officers and any other insurance premiums; 

interest payable on debt incurred to finance our investments;

Independent Trustee fees and expenses; 

the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our Shareholders, the SEC and other regulatory authorities (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any Shareholders meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; and 

our fidelity bond. 

We bear other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with and as set forth in more detail in our Advisory Agreement (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 Use of Leverage 
 We are a party to debt financing arrangements that allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as leverage and could increase or decrease returns to our Shareholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. As a BDC, pursuant to the 1940 Act, our total borrowings are limited. We are allowed to borrow amounts such that the ratio of our total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to our total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus preferred shares, if any, is at or above 200 immediately after such borrowing. This means that we can borrow up to 1 for every 1 of investor equity. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our Adviser s and our Board of Trustees assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. 46 

Market Opportunity 
 We believe the middle market lending environment, and in particular our focus area within middle market lending, is attractive throughout the credit cycle as a result of a combination of the following: 
 Size of the Middle Market Environment and Resulting Demand for Capital. The middle market is a critical portion of the U.S. economy and serves an outsized role in terms of GDP and revenues. According to the National Center for The Middle Market Year-End 2023 Middle Market Indicator, there are nearly 200,000 businesses in the U.S. middle market which represents one-third of private sector GDP and employment. Moreover, it was reported that, in 2023, revenues increased for 83 of middle market companies at an average rate of 12.4 , representing two new high marks for the middle market. The Middle Market Indicator defines U.S. middle market companies as those with annual revenue between 10 million and 1 billion, significantly overlapping with our definition of U.S. middle market companies. The contribution from middle market companies to the economy has grown over time, and as the sector continues to expand, we believe there will be a similarly outsized need for capital. Historically, U.S. commercial and regional banks were traditional lenders to the middle market. However, regulatory and structural changes have taken place in the lending space that have resulted in less supply of capital for middle market companies from these traditional lenders. This has created an attractive lending opportunity for direct lenders to fill the void of traditional lenders. Specialty Lending Market. We believe that middle market lending opportunities yield higher returns with better creditor protections when compared to broadly syndicated loan opportunities and that a unique opportunity exists for specialty lenders with differentiated sourcing channels and underwriting expertise to structure deals with more favorable terms than the broader market. We believe there persists a void in the market for deals where the borrower is in an industry or position that requires the lender to (i) conduct independent in-depth enterprise and collateral analysis and/or understand complexity, (ii) offer creative customized solutions and/or (iii) provide capital with speed and certainty of execution. We believe the reduced competition and barriers to entry within these deals allow us to originate loans at a risk-adjusted return premium to the broader market and to secure relatively stronger covenant packages, which provides our loans with significant downside protection. Specialty Lending Expertise. Successfully lending within the middle market space requires a specialized skill set, particularly in assessing credit quality and risk, assessing business valuations, structuring and documentation, and asset management. Lenders in the middle market space have the ability to enhance value through intricate knowledge of capital structures and business dynamics, and through thoughtful structuring of financial covenants. Furthermore, lenders who engage in robust asset monitoring and management can successfully enhance returns throughout the business and credit cycle. We believe Silver Point is well-positioned to extract value from middle market opportunities given its platform, deep credit expertise, and experience managing portfolios of loans across cycles. Attractive Opportunities to Invest in Senior Secured and Floating Rate Loans. We believe that opportunities to invest in senior secured loans are attractive because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and the defensive characteristics of these types of investments. We believe that floating rate debt investments can offer a superior return profile relative to fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value. In addition, senior secured debt possesses attractive defensive characteristics given its priority in payment relative to junior debt holders and equity holders. Periods of economic uncertainty present both significant opportunities and risks . Increased volatility and market dislocation often result in a weakened capital base for new loan supply, and an increase in lending opportunities that require private capital to be accretive solution providers. We believe that the current macroeconomic backdrop represents an attractive opportunity as, in addition to the borrowers that were already prioritizing private credit for their capital needs, there may be significantly increased demand for private credit from the dislocated public markets and we believe this will continue through the remainder of 2024. Given our capabilities and expertise in the specialty lending market, we believe we have built an all-cycle business model and we are well positioned to take advantage of this shift in the operating landscape.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income of 32.3 million increased by approximately 2.7 million from 29.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest income (excluding PIK) of 1.9 million. The increase in interest income (excluding PIK) was primarily driven by an increase in average portfolio size of 65.0 million at fair value. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income of 93.4 million increased by approximately 9.0 million from 84.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest income (excluding PIK) of approximately 6.7 million. The increase in interest income (excluding PIK) was largely due to an increase in average portfolio size of 77.1 million at fair value, partially offset by a decrease in annualized yield (excluding PIK) of approximately 15 basis points.

Interest and financing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.2 million over prior period, primarily due to an increase in weighted average borrowing costs of approximately 14 basis points primarily driven by an increase in the average SOFR rate. Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, Income Incentive Compensation increased approximately 0.4 million, in addition to the 3.6 million change in the Incentive Compensation Clawback. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total expenses increased 5.1 million to 42.5 million from 37.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest and financing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.8 million over the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in annualized weighted average borrowing costs of approximately 46 basis points primarily driven by an increase in the average SOFR rate. Additionally, Income Incentive Compensation increased by approximately 1.3 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 relative to the same period in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the nonrecurring deferred offering costs write off of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net realized gain (loss) on investments was (0.0) million and (9.2) million, respectively, primarily driven by no exits and exits in two portfolio companies with respective realized losses greater than 1.0 million, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net realized gain (loss) on investments was 6.1 million and (11.3) million, respectively, primarily driven by three portfolio company investments, one portfolio company exit with respective realized gains greater than 1.0 million and three portfolio companies with respective losses greater than 1.0), respectively. 
 50 

Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 We fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Upon exiting an investment, we reverse the unrealized appreciation or depreciation and recognize realized gain or loss, if any. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments was (4.5) million and 9.5 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had gross unrealized appreciation of 6.3 million, primarily driven by an increase in the fair value of our debt investments; we had gross unrealized depreciation of (10.8) million, primarily driven by four portfolio companies with respective unrealized depreciation above (1.0) million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had gross unrealized appreciation of 20.6 million, primarily driven by five portfolio companies with respective unrealized gains greater than 1.0 million; we had gross unrealized depreciation of (11.1) million, primarily driven by three portfolio companies with respective unrealized depreciation above (1.0) million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments was (16.5) million and 9.7 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we had gross unrealized appreciation of 13.2 million, primarily driven by an increase in the fair value of our debt investments including two portfolio companies with respective unrealized appreciation above 1.0 million; we had gross unrealized depreciation of (29.7) million, primarily driven by eight portfolio companies with respective unrealized depreciation above (1.0) million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had gross unrealized appreciation of 26.3 million, primarily driven by eight portfolio companies with respective unrealized gains greater than 1.0 million; we had gross unrealized depreciation of (16.6) million, primarily driven by five portfolio companies with respective unrealized depreciation above (1.0) million. Federal Income Taxes 
 The Fund is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes as each investor is individually liable for income taxes, if any, on its share of net taxable income on a flow through basis. Interest, dividends, and other income realized from non-U.S. sources and capital gains realized on the sale of securities of non-U.S. issuers may be subject to withholding and other taxes levied by the jurisdiction in which the income is sourced. Such withholding taxes are accrued when incurred as withholding taxes against the relevant income stream. 
 Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return 
 Since commencement of our investment operations on July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2024, we have fully exited investments in 162 portfolio companies, which have resulted in an unlevered internal rate of return (gross of expenses) of 13.2 , or unlevered internal rate of return (net of expenses) of 10.2 on resolved assets. The internal rate of return is the percentage rate of return earned on each dollar invested related to realized investments, based on the amounts and effective dates of each funding and repayment related to each realized investment. Please see above for more information regarding Fund expenses. The Fund expects to use leverage and, to the extent that returns on investments are greater than the interest the Fund pays on leverage, returns to Shareholders will be increased. Derivatives and Hedging 
 We have designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship associated with our fixed rate debt and we also use interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate risk exposure of certain fixed rate investments. We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments. See Note 2 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the accounting policies and additional disclosure for derivative instruments. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding the carrying value of the hedged debt. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from net investor capital contributions/equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are investments, costs of operations, debt service, repayment and other financing costs and distributions to investors. 
 We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt and convertible debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 218 and 219 , respectively. We have carefully considered our unfunded portfolio commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and liquidity including our financial leverage. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
 51 

our unfunded portfolio commitments were approximately 58.6 million and 27.9 million, respectively. Further, we maintain sufficient cash, cash equivalents and borrowing capacity to cover any short term funding requirements. 
 Cash as of September 30, 2024, taken together with cash available from our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 90.3 million of availability on our third-party debt facilities, subject to asset coverage limitations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 75.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, foreign cash held at banks and restricted cash and cash equivalents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was (7.8) million, primarily driven by payments for the purchase of investments of (215.8) million, net change in unsettled transactions of (13.3) million and other operating activity of (7.8) million, partially offset by proceeds from sales, paydowns and resolutions of investments of 183.7 million and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of 40.7 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was (35.8) million, primarily due to dividends paid of (38.7) million.

2026 Notes 
 On November 4, 2021, the Fund placed 145 million aggregate principal amount of notes that mature on November 4, 2026 (the 2026 Notes ). The 2026 Notes were issued in two tranches, with 100 million of tranche A notes funded on November 4, 2021 and 45 million of tranche B notes funded on January 21, 2022. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.00 per year, payable semi-annually on November 4 and May 4, of each year, commencing on May 4, 2022. The 2026 Notes are governed by a purchase agreement, dated November 4, 2021, by and among the Fund and the purchasers. In connection with the 2026 Notes, the Fund entered into interest rate swaps during the second quarter of 2023 and applied hedge accounting for the designated hedge relationship between the 2026 Notes and the swaps. As a result of these swaps, the Fund's effective interest rate on the 2026 52 

Notes is SOFR plus 4 basis points during the swaps' outstanding period (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more details). 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On October 17, 2017, Specialty Credit Facility, LLC (the "Borrower"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund, entered into a secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with Deutsche Bank AG, as facility agent and U.S. Bank National Association as collateral agent. On June 24, 2024, the Borrower entered into Amendment No. 19 to the Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility Amendment ). The Credit Facility Amendment revised the interest rate applicable to any collateral obligation or advance denominated in Canadian dollars under the Revolving Credit Facility to be the sum of (i) the greater of (x) 0.25 and (y) the term Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average for a tenor of three months on the day prescribed by the Revolving Credit Facility, and (ii) an adjustment of 0.32138 . As of September 30, 2024, the commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility was 100 million and amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 3-month SOFR plus a margin of 2.85 per annum. We also pay a commitment fee of 0.40 per annum on any undrawn amount. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by the assets of the borrower (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more details). 
 Distributions 
 We intend to pay quarterly dividends to our Shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Trustees and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board of Trustees may deem relevant from time to time (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more details). 
 Unfunded Portfolio Commitments 
 From time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower s demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured term loan commitments generally require certain criteria to be met to be released, and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:

We seek to carefully consider our unfunded portfolio company commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we consider any outstanding unfunded portfolio company commitments we are required to fund within the 200 asset coverage limitation. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we had adequate financial resources to satisfy the unfunded portfolio company commitments, with cash and cash equivalents on hand and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 Contracts 
 We have entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments: the Advisory Agreement and the sub-administration agreement (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Payments under the Advisory Agreement are equal to (1) a percentage of the Shareholders aggregate net capital contributions, (2) a two-part incentive fee and (3) reimbursements equal to an amount that the Administrator incurs for costs and expenses and the Fund s allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Adviser in performing its obligations as Administrator under the Advisory Agreement. Either party may terminate the Advisory Agreement without penalty upon at least 60 days written notice to the other. Financial Instruments 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Valuation of Investments and Derivative Contracts 
 
 The Board of Trustees has designated the Adviser as the Fund s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Adviser has appointed its BDC Valuation Committee with the responsibility for fair value determinations pursuant to valuation procedures adopted for the Fund. The Board of Trustees oversees the Adviser in its role as valuation designee in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 
 Investments and derivative contracts are valued in good faith by the Adviser, as the Fund s valuation designee, at fair value pursuant to the valuation policy, which considers quotations provided by independent pricing sources, when such quotations are available and deemed reliable. The Fund conducts this valuation process on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Investments that are not listed on an exchange but are actively traded over-the-counter are generally valued at the representative bid quotation if held long and the representative ask quotation if held short or, in the case of equities that trade in over-the-counter marketplaces, at the last deemed reliable sale price provided by independent pricing sources. Derivative contracts not listed on an exchange are generally valued through industry-standard valuation models using inputs obtained from pricing vendors and from the relevant derivative contract. 
 
 The estimated fair value of financial instruments is based upon available information and may not be the amount that the Fund would realize in a current transaction or might be ultimately realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances, and the differences could be material. 
 
 In accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures under U.S. GAAP, the Fund discloses the fair value of its investments according to a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure the fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices on a securities exchange in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation (level 3 measurements). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below: 
 
 Level 1: Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices on a securities exchange in active markets for identical assets or 	liabilities; 
 
 Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices on a securities exchange that are observable for the asset or liability either 		directly or indirectly in active markets, or unadjusted prices on a securities exchange in markets that are not 		considered to be active; 
 
 Level 3: Significant inputs that may be unobservable or inputs, including market quotations other than quoted prices 		on a securities exchange, in markets that are not considered to be active. 
 
 Inputs are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation decisions including assumptions about risk. Inputs may include price information, volatility statistics, specific and broad credit data, liquidity statistics and other factors. An investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes observable requires judgment by the Adviser. The Adviser considers observable data to be that market data which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by multiple independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. The categorization of an investment within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the investment and does not necessarily correspond to the Adviser s perceived risk of that instrument. 
 In determining an instrument s placement within the hierarchy, the Adviser separates the Fund s investment portfolio into two categories: investments and derivative contracts. Each of these categories can further be divided between assets and liabilities and further by investment type. 
 
 54 

Investments that are valued based on dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are generally classified within level 2. These may include certain bonds or bank loans. 
 
 Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or privately negotiated over-the-counter OTC ). OTC derivatives, including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps are generally valued using observable inputs. In instances where models are used, the value of an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability and reliability of observable inputs. OTC derivatives are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on their liquidity or the observability of their inputs. 
 
 Investments classified within level 3 have significant unobservable inputs. Level 3 instruments may include certain bank loans, trust interests, private equity and real estate properties. When observable prices are not available for these investments, one or more valuation techniques (e.g., market approach or income approach) for which sufficient and reliable data is available may be used. Within level 3, the use of the market approach technique generally consists of using comparable market data, while the use of the income approach technique generally consists of the net present value of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other factors. Quotations provided by independent pricing sources may also be considered, if available and deemed reliable, in determining the value of level 3 investments. 
 The inputs used in estimating the value of level 3 investments that are not valued using quotations provided by independent pricing sources may include but are not limited to the original transaction price, recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable issuers, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt capital markets, discount rates, durations and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. Comparable public companies may also be identified based on industry, size, strategy, etc. and a trading multiple or yield is determined for each comparable company. Additionally, level 3 investments may also be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with the amount of such discount estimated in the absence of market information. Assumptions used due to the lack of observable inputs may significantly impact the resulting fair value and therefore the Fund s consolidated results of operations. 
 See Note 2 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our valuation process, as well key assumptions and inputs used in valuation of level 3 investments period over period. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 On November 7, 2024, the Board declared a dividend of 0.33 per share and a supplemental dividend of 0.02 per share, payable on November 12, 2024, for Shareholders of record on September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including but not limited to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 94.5 of our total debt investments at fair value (or 96.1 of our performing debt investments) bore floating interest rates. From time to time, the Fund seeks to mitigate interest rate risk associated with fixed rate investments by entering into interest rate swaps. With the impact of the interest rate swaps, approximately 96.8 of our performing debt investments based on fair value were effectively floating rate investments as of September 30, 2024. Our Revolving Credit Facility and a majority of the 2024 CLO also bear floating interest rates; in connection with our fixed-rate 2026 Notes, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps under a designated hedge accounting relationship, in order to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more details). Assuming that our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate caps and floors, if any, for floating rate instruments):

(1) Includes the impact of effective hedge through interest rate swaps associated with the 2026 Notes. 

(2) Excludes the impact of income based incentive fees. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on fees. 

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net investment income. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under our Revolving Credit Facility. Instead of entering into a foreign exchange forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 
 Item 4. Con trols and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PAR T II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal P roceedings 
 From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies.
