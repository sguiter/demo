FORWARD-L OOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including without limitation statements regarding our business model and strategic plans for our products, technologies and business, including our implementation thereof; the impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation from macroeconomic conditions; the timing of and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and certifications; our expectations about our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop our next generation system, the ALLY Robotic Cataract Laser System ALLY System ), and the timing thereof; the ALLY System's performance and market impact; the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents; industry trends and conditions impacting various markets in which we operate; and the plans and objectives of management for future operations and capital expenditures are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 Without limiting the foregoing, in some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as aim , may, will, should, expect, exploring, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, seeks, or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future results, performance, or achievements, and one should avoid placing undue reliance on such statements. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. Such beliefs and assumptions may or may not prove to be correct. Additionally, such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to various factors, including, but not limited to, those identified in Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: 
 our history of operating losses and ability to achieve or sustain profitability; 

our ability to develop, receive and maintain regulatory clearance or certification of and successfully commercialize the ALLY System and to maintain our LENSAR Laser System LLS (collectively the Systems 

the impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations and our suppliers and distributors as a result of global macroeconomic conditions; 

the willingness of patients to pay the price difference for our products compared to a standard cataract procedure covered by Medicare or other insurance; 

our ability to grow our U.S. sales and marketing organization or maintain or grow an effective network of international distributors; 

our future capital needs and our ability to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all; 

the impact to our business, financial condition and results of operations as a result of a material disruption to the supply or manufacture of our Systems or necessary component parts for such Systems or material inflationary pressures affecting pricing of component parts; 

our ability to compete against competitors that have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources than we do; 

our ability to address the numerous risks associated with marketing, selling and leasing our products in markets outside the United States; 

the impact to our business, financial condition and results of operations as a result of exposure to the credit risk of our customers; 

our ability to accurately forecast customer demand and our inventory levels; 

the impact to our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to secure adequate coverage or reimbursement by government or other third-party payors for procedures using our ALLY System or our other products, or changes in such coverage or reimbursement; 

the impact to our business, financial condition and results of operations of product liability suits brought against us; 

iii 

risks related to government regulation applicable to our products and operations; and 

risks related to our intellectual property and other intellectual property matters. 

Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. 
 Unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise, references to LENSAR, the Company, we, us, and our, refer to LENSAR, Inc. 
 We own or have registered rights to certain trademarks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property used in our business, including LENSAR, the LENSAR logo, Streamline, IntelliAxis, IntelliAxis Refractive Capsulorhexis, ALLY, Intelligent Incisions, Augmented Reality, ALLY Robotic Cataract Laser System, and the ALLY Robotic Cataract Laser System logo, Robotic Laser Cataract Surgery, and the Robotic Laser Cataract Surgery logo, each of which is considered a trademark.

RISK FACTOR SUMMARY 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following: 
 Our results have been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely affected by economic uncertainty or deteriorations in economic conditions. 

We expect to incur operating losses for the near-term future and we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. 

We have historically derived our revenue from the sale or lease of our Systems as well as the associated procedure licenses and sale of consumables used in each procedure involving our Systems. The commercial success of our ALLY System will depend upon receipt of additional regulatory clearances or certifications and our ability to maintain and grow significant market acceptance for it. 

Our growth depends on our ability to gain regulatory clearances and certifications, as well as our ability to meet production goals for our ALLY System. 

Patients may not be willing to pay for the price difference between a standard cataract procedure and an advanced cataract procedure in which a laser system such as ours is used, an increment which is typically not covered by Medicare, private insurance or other third-party payors. 

If we are not able to effectively grow our U.S. sales and marketing organization or maintain or grow an effective network of international distributors, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. 

If the supply or manufacture of our Systems or other products associated with the Systems is materially disrupted, including by supply chain shortages and price increases, it may adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and could negatively affect our operating results. 

We currently compete, and expect to compete in the future against other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products or greater resources than we do. 

To successfully market, sell and lease our products in markets outside of the United States, we must address many international business risks with which we have limited experience. 

Our products and operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business. 

We may not receive, or may be delayed in receiving, the necessary clearances, certifications or approvals for our future products, or modifications to our current products, and failure to timely obtain additional clearances, certifications or approvals for our ALLY System and future products or modifications to our current products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business. 

Our success will depend on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights.

NOTES TO CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) 

 . The Company expects to continue to incur losses and cash outflows from operating activities for the near-term future. Pricing increases in component parts for the ALLY System resulting from inflationary pressures and related macroeconomic conditions may necessitate an increase in overall cost to customers, which in turn may have an adverse impact on customer demand. Management believes the Company s cash and cash equivalents on hand, together with cash generated from the future sale and lease of products, will provide sufficient funds for its operating, investing, and financing cash flows for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. The Company expects annual revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses to increase from current levels associated with the increase in ALLY System placements. In addition, the Company s growth depends in part on the Company s ability to produce the ALLY System in sufficient quantities, within requested timelines and at an acceptable price to satisfy customer demand. The Company s liquidity needs will be largely determined by the Company s ability to continue to successfully commercialize its products and the progression, additional regulatory clearances or certifications and launch of the ALLY System in additional jurisdictions in the future. In the future, the Company may need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings, borrowings under credit facilities or from other sources in the future. The Company may issue securities, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and/or debt securities through private placement transactions or registered public offerings in the future. The Company s ability to raise additional funds will depend, among other factors, on financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are outside of the Company s control, and the Company may be unable to raise financing when needed, or on terms favorable to the Company. If the necessary funds are not available from these sources, the Company may have to delay, reduce or suspend the scope of its sales and marketing efforts, research and development activities, or other components of its operations. Basis of Presentation These condensed financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for interim financial information and, therefore, omit or condense certain footnotes and other information normally included. The condensed financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that management of the Company believes are necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented. These interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the full fiscal year. The December 31, 2023 condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements and related financial information should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual audited financial statements and the related notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 , included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report as filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024.

 in product revenue, in cost of product sales, and in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 associated with its Indian operations. There were no amounts due from, or due to, the distributor at March 31, 2024. The related party relationship ended on April 1, 2024. 
 in each period, which resulted from maintaining a full valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax assets. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), certain substantial changes in the Company s ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may be used in future years. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company experienced a change in control event resulting from the Private Placement of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, triggering the application of Section 382 of the Code. Refer to Note 11, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock , for more details related to the Private Placement. The Company has not completed an analysis to determine whether any additional limitations have been triggered under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code as of September 30, 2024 . The Company computed and applied limitations of tax deductions in the income tax provision computation for the year ended December 31, 2023; however, these limitations do not have a material impact on the financial statements.

Refer to Note 11, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock , for more details related to the Private Placement. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions Fundamental Transactions, as defined below), the Warrants provide that they are redeemable by the holder thereof for a value determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model with inputs calculated as described in the applicable Warrant, which includes a floor on the volatility input to be utilized. The Company has determined that this provision introduces leverage to the holders of the Warrants that could result in a value that would be greater than the settlement amount of a fixed-for-fixed option on the Company s own equity shares. Accordingly, pursuant to ASC 815, the Company classified the fair value of the Warrants as a liability to be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations. Of the gross proceeds for the Private Placement, was allocated to the Warrants and the remaining was allocated to the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrant liabilities using recently quoted market prices of the Company's common stock and the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

over the next 18 months. LENSAR expects to meet these requirements. Employee Retention Credit In March 2020, the United States enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act ). The CARES Act provides for an employee retention credit ERC ), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes paid in 2020 and 2021. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company received a majority of the ERC. As such, the Company recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, which represents the ERC net of professional fees in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , amounts were recorded related to the ERC. Legal Matters The medical device market in which LENSAR participates is largely technology driven. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. On August 14, 2023, stockholders Ryan Schaper and Christopher P. Bolster filed a Verified Amended Class Action Complaint against the Company and certain of its officers and members of the board of directors Defendants in the matter captioned Schaper v. LENSAR, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-00692-JLH (D. Del.). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14d-9 promulgated thereunder, and assert claims challenging the adequacy of disclosures in the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on June 20, 2023, or the Proxy, in connection with the Private Placement. On August 18, 2023, the parties filed a joint stipulation extending Defendants time to respond to the complaint until a lead plaintiff is appointed and plaintiffs file a second amended complaint or designate the Verified Amended Class Action Complaint as operative. On December 12, 2023, the Court appointed Ryan Schaper and Christopher P. Bolster as Lead Plaintiffs. On December 22, 2023, the parties filed a joint stipulation providing that Lead Plaintiffs' will file a second amended complaint or designate the Verified Amended Class Action Complaint as operative on or before January 12, 2024. On January 12, 2024, Lead Plaintiffs filed a Verified Second Amended Class Action Complaint. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 26, 2024. The parties completed briefing on the motion to dismiss in May 2024. The Company vigorously denies that the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on June 20, 2023 was deficient in any respect, or that that supplemental disclosures were required or necessary under applicable laws. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome, or provide a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter. This matter or other such matters may be time-consuming, divert management s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability or require us to change our business practices, even if we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any such actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

 , shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and the Warrants (the Private Placement ). Refer to Note 9, Warrant Liabilities , for more details related to the Warrants. The Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock at the election of NR-GRI. On August 1, 2023, the Company s stockholders voted to approve the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants. As a result of the stockholders approval of the Private Placement, applicable ownership limitations under Nasdaq rules were lifted, and NR-GRI became entitled to convert shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock or exercise Warrants up to the full amount purchased in the Private Placement. Holders of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with holders of common stock. The Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock as to distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, and holders of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock participate with the holders of the common stock on an as-converted basis to the extent any dividends are declared on common stock. The shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically be redeemed in connection with certain transactions Fundamental Transactions ), including a merger, sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company, recapitalization, or the sale by the Company of shares resulting in more than ownership by a person or group. In such event, the redemption price would be equal to the greater of the stated value of the shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock or the consideration per share of common stock in the Fundamental Transaction (or in the absence of such consideration, the volume-weighted average price of the Company s common stock immediately preceding the closing of the Fundamental Transaction). The Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is classified as temporary equity in the condensed balance sheet because redemption automatically occurs upon a Fundamental Transaction. However, redemption is not considered probable; therefore, the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is not accreted to face value. The proceeds of the transaction were allocated first to the fair value of warrants due to the classification of the warrants as a liability on the condensed balance sheet and the remainder of the proceeds were allocated to the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. Offering costs of were allocated ratably based on the allocation of proceeds; was allocated to the general and administrative expenses and was allocated to Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. Offering costs were subsequently reduced by in the three months ended June 30, 2024 as all offering costs were paid and allocated ratably based on the allocation of proceeds; was allocated to general and administrative expenses and was allocated to Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is presented net of offering costs on the condensed balance sheet. In connection with the parties entry into the SPA, the Company and NR-GRI entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company filed a resale registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-272930) with respect to the resale of the shares of the Company s common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants.

Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, as well as the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto, and the discussion under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors Summary and Risk Factors sections for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage medical device company focused on designing, developing and marketing an advanced laser system for the treatment of cataracts and the management of pre-existing or surgically induced corneal astigmatism. Our systems incorporate a range of proprietary technologies designed to assist the surgeon in obtaining better visual outcomes, efficiency and reproducibility by providing advanced imaging, simplified procedure planning, efficient design and precision. We believe the cumulative effect of these technologies results in a laser system that can be quickly and efficiently integrated into a surgeon s existing practice, is easy to use and provides surgeons the ability to deliver improved visual outcomes more efficiently. 
 Our current product portfolio includes the LENSAR Laser System, or LLS, and ALLY Robotic Cataract Laser System , or ALLY System (collectively, the Systems) and its associated consumable components. The consumable portion of the system consists of a disposable patient interface device kit, or PID kit, and the system also requires a procedure license. Each procedure on each system requires the use of a PID kit. The PID kit includes a suction ring, vacuum filter and fluidic connection that are designed to facilitate placement of the laser while minimizing a patient s discomfort, intraocular pressure and trauma to the retina and maintaining corneal integrity. The procedure license is downloaded onto the system as required or as purchased by the customer. The system will not perform a procedure without a valid license. We sell licenses individually and also offer licenses in a subscription package with minimum monthly obligations and the ability to increase procedure numbers as the practice grows to address occasional increases in demand. We believe this structure allows the surgeon to implement a budget while also providing us with a predictable revenue stream. 
 We are focused on continuous innovation and have launched our proprietary next generation ALLY System. The ALLY System is designed to transform premium cataract surgery by utilizing our advanced robotic technologies with the ability to perform the entire procedure in a sterile operating room or in-office surgical suite, delivering operational efficiencies and reducing overhead. Our ALLY System received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA in June 2022, and we executed a controlled and targeted initial launch of the ALLY System beginning in August 2022. The ALLY System is available to all U.S. and European Union, or EU, cataract surgeons and has also received regulatory clearance in India, Taiwan, as well as certain other countries. In 2022, we transitioned from manufacturing and selling our LLS to focus on our ALLY System. In addition, we are pursuing additional marketing or certification applications through our distributors in South Korea and China, but this process could take multiple years. Our growth, market presence and ability to sell the ALLY System will depend on whether the ALLY System receives additional regulatory clearances or certifications and the timing of these clearances or certifications, among other factors. Our future revenue and cash flows will depend on, among other factors, our installed base of Systems and the timing of and applicable clearances for our ALLY System. 
 We have built and are continuing to grow our commercial organization, which includes a direct sales force in the United States and distributors in Germany, China, India, South Korea and other targeted international markets. We believe there is significant opportunity for us to expand our presence in these countries and other markets and regions, subject to applicable regulatory clearance or certification. In the United States, we sell our products through a direct sales organization that, as of September 30, 2024, consisted of approximately 65 commercial professionals, including regional sales managers, clinical applications and outcomes specialists, field service, marketing, technical and customer support personnel. We manufacture our Systems at a facility in Orlando, Florida. We purchase custom and off-the-shelf components from a number of suppliers, including some single-source suppliers. We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders with limited long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods. We strive to maintain enough inventory of our various component parts to avoid the impact of potential disruptions in the supply chain; however, availability of these components can be outside of our control. 
 Our revenue increased from 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 38 , primarily due to increased ALLY System sales and procedure volume. Our net (loss) profit was 1.5 million) and 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our revenue increased from 30.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 22 , primarily due to increased ALLY System sales and procedure volume. Our net loss was 12.7 
 24 

million and 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 3.7 million impairment charge on intangible assets. Our installed base of Systems is approximately 355 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Factors to Consider 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. We are subject to risks common to medical device companies, including risks inherent in: 
 our laser system development and commercialization efforts; 

clinical studies; 

uncertainty of regulatory actions and marketing approvals or certifications; 

reliance on a network of international distributors and a network of suppliers; 

levels of coverage and reimbursement by government or other third-party payors for procedures using our products; 

patients willingness and ability to pay for procedures with significant costs not covered by or reimbursable through government or other third-party payors; 

enforcement of patent and proprietary rights; 

the need for future capital; 

all safety requirements and suggestions regarding patient treatment as required or suggested by health care authorities; 

clearance or certification by regulatory agencies, including the FDA, or notified bodies for our ALLY System; 

supply chain shortages, labor market shifts and price increases resulting from various macroeconomic factors; 

competition associated with our products; and 

reimbursement practices in jurisdictions where procedures using our Systems are performed, such as South Korea. 

We cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient funding to meet our future capital requirements. 
 Our revenues and operating expenses are also difficult to predict and depend on several factors, including the level of ongoing research and development requirements necessary to further develop and/or obtain further regulatory clearance or certification of our ALLY System, the number of Systems we manufacture, sell, and lease on an annual basis, the availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies or notified bodies, which are difficult to predict. We may be able to control the timing and level of research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of our actions due to contractually committed activities and payments. 
 Global economic uncertainty and other factors have impeded global supply chains, resulted in longer lead times and delays in procuring component parts and raw materials, and resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. In particular, a global semiconductor supply shortage has had, and is continuing to have, wide-ranging effects across multiple industries. We have seen significant disruptions in the supply of, timing of delivery of and fluctuations in pricing for various component parts needed for our products, including the integrated circuits used in our Systems, and expect these trends may reappear in the future. While we are not directly exposed to economic conditions in Russia or Ukraine, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has also had a substantial impact on global supply chains and may be a contributing factor to the supply chain shortages we are experiencing. Supply chain disruptions and broad-based inflationary impacts have negatively impacted the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows since 2020 and these supply chain constraints may result in future impacts to our business. We expect these inflationary impacts to continue for the foreseeable future. A high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain and increase our gross margin or decrease our operating expenses as a percentage of our revenues if our selling prices of our products do not increase as much or more than our increase in costs. 
 As a result of these and other factors, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of future performance, and any interim results we present are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year.

Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Total revenue comprises product revenue, service revenue and lease revenue. We derive product revenue from the sale of our Systems and sales of our PIDs and procedure licenses to our surgeon customers and to our distributors outside the United States. A PID and procedure license, which may also be referred to as an application license, is required to perform each procedure using our laser system. A procedure license represents a one-time right to utilize the system surgical application in connection with a surgery procedure. Service revenue is derived from the sale of extended warranties for our Systems that provide additional maintenance and service beyond our standard limited warranty. In some situations, we lease our Systems to surgeons, primarily through non-cancellable leases with a fixed lease payment. We consider all components of our revenue to be recurring source revenue, with the exception of sales of our Systems. The following table provides information about revenue and revenue attributable to recurring sources, which we consider to be all components of our revenue except for sales of our systems:

Cost of Revenue 
 Total cost of revenue comprises cost of product revenue , cost of lease revenue and cost of service revenue. 
 Cost of product revenue primarily consists of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products, plant overhead, personnel costs, such as salaries and wages, including stock-based compensation and benefits, packaging costs, depreciation expense, freight and other related costs, which include shipping, inspection and excess and obsolete inventory charges. Cost of service revenue primarily consists of costs associated with providing maintenance services under our standard limited warranty as well as extended warranty contracts. Cost of lease revenue primarily consists of depreciation expense associated with leased equipment and shipping costs associated with delivery of these Systems. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, such as salaries and wages, including stock-based compensation and benefits, professional fees, marketing, insurance, travel and other expenses. 
 We are continuing to grow our sales efforts in the United States. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in association with our planned growth. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Our research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering, product development, clinical studies to develop and support our products, personnel costs, such as salaries and wages, including stock-based compensation and benefits, regulatory expenses, and other costs associated with products and technologies that are in development. Currently, our research and development expense primarily consists of costs associated with the continued development of our next generation system, the ALLY System, which combines all of the features from our LLS with a dual-modality laser, integrated in a small, compact cataract treatment system that is designed to allow surgeons to perform a sterile laser-assisted cataract surgery in a single operating room or in-office surgical suite. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of acquired trademarks, acquired technology, and customer relationships. Acquired trademarks and acquired technology are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 15 to 20 years. Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis or a double declining basis over their estimated useful lives up to 20 years, based on the method that better represents the economic benefits to be obtained. 
 26 

Impairment 
 In April 2024, the Company notified its third-party supplier of the phacoemulsification component in the ALLY System the Company would no longer pursue integration with the supplier s phacoemulsification unit. This resulted in a triggering event impacting certain acquired technology intangible assets and contract liabilities associated with the phacoemulsification component. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeded the estimated recoverable amount of 0 and recorded an impairment of intangible assets of 3.9 million. The impairment charge was offset with the write-off of contract liabilities associated with the intangible assets of 0.2 million. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities consists of the change in estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities using recently quoted market prices of the Company's common stock and the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 Income Taxes 
 Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the option of expensing all research and development expenditures in the current year, instead requiring amortization over five years for expenditures in the United States and over fifteen years for foreign-based expenditures, pursuant to Section 174 of the Code, or Section 174. The impact of Section 174 on the Company s cash from operations depends primarily on the amount of research and development expenditures incurred. Section 174 has not had a material impact on the Company since its effective date. The Company will continue to review the application of Section 174 (together with any relevant Internal Revenue Service guidance, proposed legislation and Treasury Department regulations relevant thereto) and any impact on the Company s cash from operations, and will adjust the estimates as necessary. 
 
 Seasonality 
 We have historically experienced seasonal variations in the sales and leases of our products, with our fourth quarter typically being the strongest and the first or third quarter being the slowest. We believe these seasonal variations are consistent across our industry.

Operating Expenses 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Selling, General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.0 million, or 19 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses increased in the quarter due to recording an Employee Retention Credit, or ERC, of 1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, which significantly reduced expenses in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the 1.4 million attributable to the ERC, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.4 million due to lower stock-based compensation expense and lower cash-based general and administrative expenses partially offset by a 16 increase in selling and marketing expenses in the third quarter of 2024 supporting the continued ALLY System growth in placements and procedures. 
 Research and Development . Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.3 million, or 21 , compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets . Amortization of intangible assets was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Selling, General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.1 million, or 0 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses increased in the period due to recording an ERC of 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which significantly reduced expenses in 2023. Excluding the ERC, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower stock-based compensation expense and lower cash-based general and administrative expenses partially offset by a 16 increase in selling and marketing expenses in the third quarter of 2024 supporting the continued ALLY System growth in placements and procedures. 
 Research and Development . Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.7 million, or 15 , compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets . Amortization of intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.1 million, or 10 , primarily due to the impairment recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Impairment of Intangible Assets. In April 2024, the Company notified its third-party supplier of the phacoemulsification component in the ALLY System the Company would no longer pursue integration with the supplier s phacoemulsification unit. This resulted in a triggering event impacting certain acquired technology intangible assets and contract liabilities associated with the phacoemulsification component. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeded the estimated recoverable amount of 0 and recorded an impairment of intangible assets of 3.9 million. The impairment charge was offset with the write-off of contract liabilities associated with the intangible assets of 0.2 million. 
 Non-Operating Income and Expense, Net 
 Non-operating income and expenses, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.3 million of expense as compared to 4.6 million of income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-operating income and expenses consisted primarily of the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in each period. 
 Non-operating income and expenses, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.3 million as compared to 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Non-operating income and expenses consisted primarily of the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in each period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We prepare and analyze operating and financial data and non-GAAP measures to assess the performance of our business, make strategic and offering decisions and build our financial projections. The key non-GAAP measures we use, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, are reconciled to net loss below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expenses. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is included in this filing because we believe that EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information for investors regarding the performance of our business and facilitates a meaningful evaluation of actual results on a comparable basis with historical results. Adjusted EBITDA is also a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA and further excluding stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, impairment of intangible assets and the Employee Retention Credit, provides meaningful supplemental information for investors when evaluating our results and comparing us to peer companies as stock-based compensation expense and change in fair value of warrant liabilities are significant non-cash charges and impairment of intangible assets is a non-cash charge that is not indicative of our core operating results and the Employee Retention Credit is not recurring. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business from quarter to quarter. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance and, therefore, any non-GAAP measures we use may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors should not consider our non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of 12.7 million and 10.5 million, respectively, and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 124.6 million. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities increased net loss by 3.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and it is difficult to predict how the fair value of warrant liabilities will impact our future results. We expect to continue to incur losses and operating cash outflows for the near-term future as we continue to build our commercial and clinical infrastructure and pursue further regulatory clearances of our ALLY System. 
 Our liquidity needs will be largely determined by our ability to successfully commercialize our products and the progression, additional regulatory clearances or certifications and launch of the ALLY System in additional jurisdictions in the future. 
 In 2022, we transitioned from manufacturing and selling our LLS to focus on our ALLY System. The ALLY System has received regulatory approval in the United States, EU, India, Taiwan, as well as certain other countries. In addition, we are pursuing additional marketing or certification applications through our distributors in South Korea and China, but this process could take multiple years. Our growth, market presence and ability to sell the ALLY System will depend on whether the ALLY System receives additional regulatory clearances or certifications and the timing of these clearance or certifications, among other factors. In addition, our future revenue and cash flows will depend on, among other factors, our installed base of Systems and the timing of and applicable clearances for our ALLY System. 
 We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase from current levels to support the expansion efforts in the U.S. and internationally for the ALLY System. The successful commercialization of the ALLY System depends in part on the Company s ability to produce the ALLY System in sufficient quantities, within requested timing and at an acceptable price to satisfy customer demand. 
 30 

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash from the sale and lease of our Systems and the sale of our consumables. We maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. As discussed above, ongoing global supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic conditions have negatively affected our capital requirements and more operating capital may be needed to fund our operations in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we expect our current cash, cash equivalents, and investments, together with cash generated from the future sale and lease of our products, to be sufficient to operate our business. Based on our current operating plan, we believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to support current operations for at least one year from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 In the future, we may need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings, borrowings under credit facilities or from other sources to continue our operations. We may issue securities, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and/or debt securities through private placement transactions or registered public offerings in the future. If we issue equity securities to raise additional capital, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional capital through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. 
 We expect our revenue and expenses to increase in connection with our on-going activities, particularly as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, including expansion of our sales and customer support teams, as well as increasing our fleet of equipment under lease. The primary factors determining our cash needs are the funding of operations, which we expect to continue to expand as the business grows, and enhancing our product offerings through the commercialization of the ALLY System. Our future liquidity needs, and ability to address those needs, will largely be determined by the success of our commercial efforts and those of our distributors; the ongoing impact of global macroeconomic conditions and supply chain issues on our business; and the timing, scope and magnitude of our commercial and development activities. 
 In May 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, or the SPA, with NR-GRI Partners, LP, or NR-GRI, whereby we sold to NR-GRI, for an aggregate purchase price of 20.0 million, an aggregate of 20,000 shares of a newly established series of preferred stock designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share , which has a stated value of 1,000 per share and is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock, and warrants, the Warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 4.4 million shares of our common stock, the Private Placement. Fifty percent of the Warrants have an exercise price equal to 2.45 per share, and 50 of the Warrants have an exercise price equal to 3.0625 per share, subject in each instance to adjustments as provided under the terms of the Warrants. Net proceeds from the transaction were approximately 19.1 million after offering expenses. The Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, if converted, would result in the issuance of 7.9 million shares of our common stock. Additionally, the terms of our Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock restrict our ability to incur debt in excess of 1.0 million or issue new shares in an amount greater than 10 of our outstanding common stock as of May 18, 2023 without the approval of the holder of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (subject to certain exceptions). 
 Our ability to raise additional funds will depend, among other factors, on financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are outside of our control, and we may be unable to raise financing when needed, or on terms favorable to us. If the necessary funds are not available from these sources, we may have to delay, reduce or suspend the scope of our sales and marketing efforts, research and development activities, or other components of our operations. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business and financial goals or to achieve or maintain profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the extent and duration of the impact that global economic uncertainty may have on our stock price and on those of other companies in our industry is highly uncertain and may make us look less attractive to investors and, as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, our stock price may be more volatile, and our ability to raise capital could be impaired, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and financial position. 
 Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments at September 30, 2024 primarily consist of 1.9 million in operating lease liabilities for our facility lease and 9.3 million in remaining minimum purchase obligations for inventory components for the manufacture and supply of certain components within the next 18 months. Our contractual obligations have increased due to supply chain issues that have necessitated us to enter into longer-term and more expensive per unit contracts to build and source inventory to satisfy the expected commercial demand for the ALLY System, if approved by regulatory authorities or certified by notified bodies in the applicable regions. We expect to meet these requirements through cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operations. Some of these amounts are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, timing, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those described. 
 The Company previously filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-255136), or the Registration Statement, which provided for the Company s offering of its securities in an amount of up to 100.0 million in the aggregate, and previously entered into 
 31 

a sales agreement providing for the offering, issuance and sale by the Company of up to an aggregate 35.0 million of its common stock from time to time in at-the-market , or ATM, offerings under the Registration Statement. No shares were sold under the ATM during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and the Registration Statement ceased to be effective in April 2024.

 The 2020 Incentive Award Plan and 2024 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan provide for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and other stock-based awards to recipients. During 2022, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units to directors, employees and non-employees. We intend to grant stock options. restricted stock units and performance stock units as part of our overall compensation package to directors, employees, and non-employees. 
 At September 30, 2024, there was approximately 1.9 million and 1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock units and performance stock units and stock options, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a 
 32 

weighted-average period of 2.1 years and 1.7 years, respectively. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense is expected to be amortized as follows:

Actual stock-based compensation expense in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our condensed financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The impact of accounting estimates and judgments on our financial condition and results of operations due to global macroeconomic conditions has introduced additional uncertainties. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. 
 There have been no significant and material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to those disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Annual Report. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3. 	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We had cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments of 18.6 million as of September 30, 2024. We generally hold our cash and cash equivalents in interest-bearing bank accounts, money market funds, and U.S. treasury bills. Our investments consist primarily of U.S. treasury bills and agency bonds, as well as certificates of deposit. All our investments are classified as available-for-sale. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in deposit demand accounts at large financial institutions in amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, insurance coverage limit of 250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. Management has reviewed the financial situation and government guarantees to depositors, if applicable, of the financial institutions and believes there to be little or no credit risk to us. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the value of our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable and notes receivable. We limit our credit risk with respect to accounts receivable and notes receivable by performing credit evaluations when deemed necessary, but we do not require collateral to secure amounts owed to us by our customers. We do have the ability to disable a system s ability to operate for lack of payment and, in the case of notes receivable, repossess the system if scheduled payments lapse. As of September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for approximately 20 of our accounts receivable, net. 
 We currently have limited exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and do not engage in any hedging activities as part of our normal course of business.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management has evaluated, with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OT HER INFORMATION 
 Item 1.	Legal P roceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. 
 On August 14, 2023, stockholders Ryan Schaper and Christopher P. Bolster filed a Verified Amended Class Action Complaint Amended Complaint against the Company and certain of its officers and members of the board of directors Defendants in the matter captioned Schaper v. LENSAR, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-00692-JLH (D. Del.). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14d-9 promulgated thereunder, and assert claims challenging the adequacy of disclosures in the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on June 20, 2023, or the Proxy, in connection with the Private Placement. On August 18, 2023, the parties filed a joint stipulation extending Defendants time to respond to the complaint. On December 12, 2023, the Court appointed Ryan Schaper and Christopher P. Bolster as Lead Plaintiffs. On December 22, 2023, the parties filed a joint stipulation providing that Lead Plaintiffs will file a second amended complaint or designate the Amended Complaint as operative on or before January 12, 2024. On January 12, 2024, Lead Plaintiffs filed a Verified Second Amended Class Action Complaint Second Amended Complaint ). The Second Amended Complaint alleges that the Proxy failed to disclose details about North Run, discussion with stockholders regarding possible financing alternatives, LENSAR s internal budget, the basis for the Board s recommendation on the vote, potential costs to LENSAR if shareholders voted against the proposal, and purported conflicts of interest. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 26, 2024. The parties completed briefing on the motion to dismiss in May 2024. 
 The Company vigorously denies that the Proxy was deficient in any respect or that supplemental disclosures were required or necessary under applicable laws. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome, or provide a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter. 
 This matter may be time-consuming, divert management s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability or require us to change our business practices, even if we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any such actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Quarterly Report, including our unaudited condensed financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, as well as our other public filings with the SEC, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the price of our common stock, could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Our results have been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely affected by economic uncertainty or deteriorations in economic conditions. 
 Global economic uncertainty, including due to factors such as increased inflation and rising interest rates, have contributed to our business and operational performance. If economic uncertainty continues or increases or if economic conditions deteriorate, these conditions may have a material adverse impact on our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity in the future. In particular, our business is impacted by inflation, such as the recent inflationary pressures related to global supply chain disruptions that have increased the cost of certain raw materials, labor and transportation used in our business. These broad-based inflationary impacts have negatively impacted our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows since 2020, and we expect these inflationary impacts to continue for the foreseeable future. A high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain and increase our gross margin or decrease our operating expenses as a percentage of our revenues if our selling prices of our products do not increase as much or more than our increase in costs. 
 We expect to incur operating losses for the near-term future and we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we had net losses of 19.9 million and 14.4 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we had net losses of 10.5 million and 12.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 
 35 

2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 124.6 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the near-term future as a result of building our commercial and clinical infrastructure, pursuing further U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and other regulatory body clearance or certification of and our further commercial launch of our proprietary, next generation cataract treatment system, known as our ALLY System, and investing in research and development. In addition, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We cannot make assurances that we will ever generate sufficient revenue from our operations to achieve profitability, and even if we achieve profitability, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively affect the value of our securities and our ability to raise capital and continue operations. 
 We have historically derived our revenue from the sale or lease of our Systems as well as the associated procedure licenses and sale of consumables used in each procedure involving our Systems. The commercial success of our ALLY System will depend upon receipt of additional regulatory clearances or certifications and our ability to maintain and grow significant market acceptance for it. 
 We have historically derived our revenue from the sale or lease of our Systems and the associated procedure licenses and consumables used in each procedure involving our Systems, and expect that this will account for a majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our ability to increase revenue is highly dependent on our ability to market and sell or lease our ALLY System and market the associated consumables. In 2022, we transitioned from manufacturing and selling our LLS to focus on our ALLY System. The ALLY System has also received regulatory approval in the European Union, or EU, India, Taiwan, as well as certain other countries. In addition, we are pursuing additional marketing or certification applications through our distributors in South Korea and China. Our growth, market presence and ability to sell the ALLY System will depend on whether the ALLY System receives additional regulatory clearances or certifications and the timing of these clearances or certifications, among other factors. In addition, our future revenue and cash flows will depend on, among other factors, our installed base of Systems. 
 Our ability to maintain our market share, execute our growth strategy, achieve commercial success and become profitable will depend upon the adoption and continued acceptance of our LLS and ALLY System by surgeons, hospital outpatient surgical facilities, in-office surgical suites and ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs. Our systems are currently used in advanced cataract procedures for which surgeon reimbursement continues to decline and patients pay a significant portion of the cost of the procedure. We cannot predict the extent to which patients will continue to seek out these types of procedures. Further, we cannot predict if cataract surgeons will continue to use our LLS or how quickly cataract surgeons will accept the ALLY System, or any planned or future products we introduce, and, if accepted, how frequently any such products will be used. Our current products may not maintain, and our ALLY System or any planned or future products we may develop or market may never gain, broad market acceptance among cataract surgeons and the medical community for the procedures in which they are designed to be used. Our ability to maintain and increase market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including: 
 our ability to provide visual outcomes and economic data that show the safety, efficacy, cost effectiveness and other patient benefits from use of our Systems or other future products; 

acceptance by cataract surgeons and others in the medical community of our Systems; 

the potential and perceived advantages and disadvantages of our Systems as compared to competing products; 

the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket for procedures in which our Systems or other future products is used but for which limited reimbursement by third-party payors, including government authorities, is available; 

the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and of those of our international distributors; 

the prevalence and severity of any complications associated with using our Systems; 

the ease of use, reliability and convenience of our Systems relative to competing products; 

competitive response and negative selling efforts from providers of competing products; 

quality of outcomes for patients in procedures in which surgeons use our Systems; 

the results of clinical trials and post-market clinical studies relating to the use of our Systems; 

the technical leadership of our research and development teams; 

36 

the absence of third party blocking intellectual property; 

our ability to introduce our products to the market with speed and on time with our projected timelines; 

pricing pressure, including from larger, well-capitalized and product-diverse competitors, corporate-owned ASCs, group purchasing organizations, and government payors; and 

the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for procedures using our Systems or other future products from third-party payors, including government authorities. 

Failure to maintain or increase market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our growth depends on our ability to gain regulatory clearances and certifications, as well as our ability to meet production goals for our ALLY System. 
 The ALLY System, which has received clearance from the FDA, enables cataract surgeons to complete the laser-assisted cataract surgery seamlessly in a single, sterile environment. The ALLY System is available to all U.S. and EU cataract surgeons and has also received regulatory clearance in India, Taiwan, as well as certain other countries. In addition, we are pursuing additional marketing or certification applications through our distributors in South Korea and China. In addition, our ability to meet production goals can also be impacted by supply chain interruptions. Our ability to place Systems in 2022 was limited by supply chain constraints that delayed the delivery of certain ALLY System raw materials and the completion and testing of ALLY Systems for use as launch-stock. If we experience further supply chain constraints, we may be unable to deliver ALLY Systems as planned. 
 The success of our ALLY System or any other new product offering or product enhancements we pursue will depend on several factors, including our ability to: 
 properly identify and anticipate cataract surgeon and patient needs; 

develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely manner; 

exclude competition based on our intellectual property rights; 

avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties; 

demonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

obtain the necessary regulatory clearances, certifications or approvals for expanded indications, new products or product modifications; 

be fully FDA (or other regulatory authority)-compliant with manufacturing and marketing of new devices or modified products; 

provide adequate training to potential users of these products; 

receive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our ALLY System or any other products we may develop in the future; and 

develop an effective and dedicated sales and marketing team. 

If we are not successful in expanding our product offering, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 37 

Patients may not be willing to pay for the price difference between a standard cataract procedure and an advanced cataract procedure in which a laser system such as ours is used, an increment which is typically not covered by Medicare, private insurance or other third-party payors. 
 Payment for a standard cataract procedure is typically covered by Medicare, private insurance or other third-party payors. However, a cataract patient seeking a greater and more versatile visual outcome may desire an advanced cataract procedure involving a laser system such as ours. The patient is typically responsible for the additional costs associated with the use of these premium technologies in the physician s practice, hospital outpatient surgical facilities, in-office surgical suites and ambulatory surgery centers. Due to this additional cost, patients may not elect to have such a procedure and our business may not grow as anticipated. Our future success depends in part upon patients achieving better visual outcomes from procedures using our Systems, or procedures involving similar laser systems that meets their expectations. If patients are not adequately satisfied with the results of such procedures, they or their surgeons may be less willing to recommend these procedures to other patients. 
 Additionally, weak or uncertain economic conditions may cause individuals to be less willing to pay for advanced cataract procedures. Although we anticipate use of our ALLY System in certain aspects of the standard cataract procedure will be covered by or reimbursable through government or other third-party payors, our current LLS procedures are not covered by or reimbursable through government or other third-party payors. A decline in economic conditions in the United States or in international markets could result in a decline in demand for the procedures in which our Systems are used and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we are not able to effectively grow our U.S. sales and marketing organization or maintain or grow an effective network of international distributors, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 In order to generate future sales growth within the United States, we will need to expand the size and geographic scope of our U.S. direct sales organization. Accordingly, our future success will depend largely on our ability to train, retain and motivate skilled regional sales managers and direct sales representatives with significant technical knowledge of our Systems. Because of the competition for their services, we may not be able to retain such representatives on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to grow our global sales and marketing organization within the United States, we may not be able to increase our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Additionally, we rely exclusively on a network of independent distributors to generate sales and leases of our Systems as well as purchases of our consumables and licensed applications outside of the United States. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for 12 of our revenue. This customer concentration exposes us to a material adverse effect if any of these significant distributors were to significantly reduce purchases for any reason or favor competitors or new market participants. If a dispute arises with a distributor or if a distributor is terminated by us or goes out of business, it may take time to locate an alternative distributor, to seek appropriate regulatory approvals and to train new personnel to market our Systems upon receiving regulatory clearance or certification in the applicable region, as well as our ability to sell those Systems in the region formerly serviced by such terminated distributor could be harmed. In addition, our international distributors may be unable to successfully market and sell our products and may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing, sales, education and training efforts that we believe are necessary to enable the products to develop, achieve or sustain market acceptance. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues from affected markets, increase our costs in those markets or damage our reputation. In addition, if an independent distributor were to depart and be retained by one of our competitors, we may be unable to prevent that distributor from helping competitors solicit business from our existing customers, which could further adversely affect us. As a result of our reliance on third-party distributors, we may be subject to disruptions and increased costs due to factors beyond our control, including labor strikes, third-party error and other issues. If the services of any of these third-party distributors become unsatisfactory, we may experience delays in meeting our customers demands and we may be unable to find a suitable replacement on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. Any failure to deliver products in a timely manner may damage our reputation and could cause us to lose potential customers. 
 Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. 
 We expect our revenues and expenses to increase in connection with our on-going activities, particularly as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, including expansion of our sales and customer support teams. The primary factors determining our cash needs are the funding of operations, which we expect to continue to expand as the business grows, and enhancing our product offerings through the research and development, further regulatory clearances and launch of the ALLY System. Our future liquidity needs, and ability to address those needs, will largely be determined by the success of our commercial efforts and those of our distributors; the timing, scope and magnitude of our commercial and development activities; and the timing of further regulatory clearance or certification of our ALLY System. We have also experienced negative effects on our capital requirements from supply chain interruptions, and we expect that supply chain disruptions will negatively affect our capital requirements and the availability of funds to finance those requirements in 
 38 

the future. In addition, market conditions impacting financial institutions could impact our ability to access some or all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and we may be unable to obtain alternative funding when and as needed and on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we expect our current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from the future sale and lease of our products, to be sufficient to operate our business for at least one year from the date of issuance of the condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. We may seek additional funds from public or private stock offerings, borrowings under credit facilities or other sources that we may not be able to maintain or obtain on acceptable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the revenue generated by the sale, lease or use of our Systems; 

the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts; 

the expenses we incur in procuring, manufacturing and selling our Systems, including increased costs, uncertainties, and delays associated with global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures; 

the costs of commercializing the ALLY System, including increased costs associated with supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures or other new products or technologies; 

the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies that we are currently conducting or may conduct in the future; 

the cost and timing of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval, certification or clearance of our products and planned or future products; 

costs associated with any product recall that may occur; 

the costs associated with complying with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations; 

the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights; 

the cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patent or other intellectual property rights; 

the cost of enforcing or defending against non-competition claims; 

the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions; 

the costs associated with increased capital expenditures; 

anticipated and unanticipated general and administrative expenses, including expenses related to operating as a public company and insurance expenses; and 

costs associated with any adverse market conditions or other macroeconomic factors. 

Such capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, which may impact our ability to obtain additional capital on favorable terms. 
 Furthermore, if we issue equity securities to raise additional capital, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. For example, in May 2023, we sold to NR-GRI Partners, LP, or NR-GRI, shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, or Warrants, that collectively represented approximately 51.5 of our total outstanding shares of common stock based on our shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024, assuming full conversion of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and full exercise of the Warrants for cash, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, or the SPA. So long as NR-GRI and its affiliates collectively beneficially own at least twenty percent of the securities issued pursuant to the SPA, including the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not, without the consent of NR-GRI, liquidate, dissolve, or wind up our affairs or effect a merger or sale of the Company or other Fundamental Transaction (as defined in Note 11, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock , included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report); create, authorize, or issue shares of capital stock that are senior or pari passu to the 
 39 

Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock; complete an acquisition with consideration above 1.0 million; incur debt in excess of 1.0 million; change our line of business; or enter into certain related-party transactions. The Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock as to distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, and holders of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock will participate with the holders of the common stock on an as-converted basis to the extent any dividends are declared on common stock. Holders of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock are also entitled to redemption rights under certain circumstances. The redemption rights and liquidation preferences assigned to holders of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, and any other repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we may assign to holders of preferred stock in the future, could affect the residual value of the common stock. 
 Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional capital through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, changes in our supplier relationships or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business and financial goals or to achieve or maintain profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If the supply or manufacture of our Systems or other products associated with the Systems is materially disrupted, including by supply chain shortages and price increases, it may adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and could negatively affect our operating results. 
 We manufacture our Systems and provide the electronic license applications at our corporate headquarters in Orlando, Florida. This is also the location where we currently conduct substantially all of our research and development activities, customer and technical support, and management and administrative functions. If our facility suffers a crippling event, or a force majeure event such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood or temporary shutdown due to a pandemic (including a resurgence of COVID-19 and its variants), epidemic or infectious disease, this could materially impact our ability to operate. 
 We purchase custom and off-the-shelf components from a number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our Systems and associated consumables are currently provided by single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). If one or more of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of materials in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, we would have to seek alternative sources of supply. Because of factors such as the proprietary nature of our products, our quality control standards and regulatory requirements, we may experience delays in engaging additional or replacement suppliers for certain components. There may also be disruptions outside our control in the availability and pricing of various component parts needed for our ALLY System. 
 In particular, a global semiconductor supply shortage has had, and is continuing to have, wide-ranging effects across multiple industries. According to certain market reports, both China and Taiwan are leading manufacturers of the world s semiconductor supply. Conflict between China and Taiwan might lead to trade sanctions, technology disputes, or supply chain disruptions, which could, in particular, affect the semiconductor industry. If this were to occur, our ability to source an adequate supply of semiconductors would be further reduced, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, any further conflict between China and Taiwan could harm our operations globally, including the operations of our customers and suppliers. 
 We have seen significant disruptions in the supply of, timing of delivery of and fluctuations in pricing for various component parts needed for our products, including the integrated circuits used in our Systems, and expect these trends to continue. Our efforts to maintain an adequate supply of inventory may not be sufficient and we may be unable to source the necessary component parts on commercially acceptable terms to reflect in the price of our system. The long-term loss of these suppliers, or their long-term inability to provide us with an adequate supply of components or products, could potentially cause delay in the manufacture of our products, thereby impairing our ability to meet the demand of our customers and causing significant harm to our business. If it becomes necessary to identify and qualify a suitable second source to replace one of our key suppliers, that replacement supplier would not have access to our previous supplier s proprietary processes and would therefore be required to develop its own, which could also result in delay. Any disruption of this nature or increased expense could harm our commercialization efforts and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If these supply chain shortages and disruptions continue or worsen, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to meet customer demand for the ALLY System. In addition, pricing increases in component parts for our Systems resulting from inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic conditions may necessitate an increase in the overall cost to customers, which in turn may have an adverse impact on customer demand. 
 We and some of our suppliers and contract facilities are required to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA (and other regulatory authorities). In particular, the FDA s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which includes FDA s current Good Manufacturing 
 40 

Practice requirements, or cGMPs, covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, inspection, complaint handling, recordkeeping, management review, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our device products. The FDA audits compliance with these regulatory requirements through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. If our manufacturing facilities or those of any of our suppliers or contract facilities are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, the FDA could take enforcement action. Similar requirements must be complied with in foreign countries and foreign regulatory authorities could also take enforcement action. Additionally, in the event we must obtain a replacement supplier or contract facility, it may be difficult for us to identify and qualify a supplier or contract facility that complies with QSR and cGMPs, which would adversely impact our operations. 
 We currently compete, and expect to compete in the future, against other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products or greater resources than we do. 
 Our industry is global, highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological, market and product-related changes. We face significant competition from large multinational medical device companies, as well as smaller, emerging players focused on product innovation. 
 Our primary competitors in providing surgical solutions for cataract patients are Alcon Inc.; Bausch + Lomb Corporation; Johnson Johnson; Carl Zeiss AG; Zeimer; and KERANOVA S.A. These competitors are focused on bringing new technologies to market and acquiring products and technologies that directly compete with our products or have potential product advantages that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 Many of our current and potential competitors are large publicly traded companies or divisions of publicly-traded companies and have several competitive advantages, including: 
 greater financial and human resources for product development and sales and marketing; 

significantly greater name recognition; 

longer operating histories; and 

more established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks. 

In addition, many of our competitors have their own intraocular lens, or IOLs, while we do not, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. If we are unable to compete effectively in this environment, it could adversely affect our business. 
 To successfully market, sell and lease our products in markets outside of the United States, we must address many international business risks with which we have limited experience. 
 We have historically sold and leased a significant portion of our LLS outside of the United States through a network of independent distributors and intend to increase our international presence in Germany, China, India, and South Korea, as well as other international markets, including through sales and leases of our ALLY System once regulatory clearance in these regions has been obtained. Our international business operations are subject to a number of risks, including: 
 difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; 

increased competition as a result of more products and procedures receiving regulatory approval, certification or clearance or otherwise becoming free to market in international markets; 

longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 

reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 

export restrictions, trade regulations, and foreign tax laws; 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 

foreign certification and regulatory clearance or approval requirements; 

41 

difficulties in developing effective marketing campaigns in unfamiliar international markets; 

customs clearance and shipping delays; 

political, social, and economic instability abroad, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, potential conflict between China and Taiwan, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general; 

preference for locally produced products; 

potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; 

the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards; and 

increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities. 

For example, in June 2022, the Supreme Court of South Korea ruled that insurance benefits for cataract surgeries should only be provided within the applicable outpatient coverage limit if inpatient treatment is unnecessary. As a result, patients are experiencing a decrease in the maximum insurance coverage allowed for cataract surgeries, which in turn has significantly decreased overall demand for ophthalmic surgeries in the region. Following the Supreme Court s decision, we have experienced reduced revenue in South Korea, and we expect this trend to continue so long as this decision remains in effect. In addition, the war between Russia and Ukraine has not had a direct material impact on our revenue to date; however, that could change depending on the magnitude of the conflict and the imposition of additional sanctions by the U.S. and other countries or the spread of the conflict to surrounding areas. Further, while we are not directly exposed to economic conditions in Russia or Ukraine, the conflict has had a substantial impact on global supply chains and may be a contributing factor to the supply chain shortages we are experiencing. 
 These risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to successfully market, sell and lease our products in markets outside of the United States. Furthermore, our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable U.S. laws. Any such risks could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. 
 We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers, which could result in material losses. 
 Customers may lease our Systems or finance the system through the product utilization, and we believe there has been an increase in demand for these types of customer leasing in recent years, especially in the United States. We may experience loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to the contractual lease terms or some other material decrease in the practice revenues and surgical procedure volume. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors. In addition, our credit risk may be highly concentrated, as we rely exclusively on a network of independent distributors to generate sales outside of the United States. Further, ongoing consolidation among distributors, retailers and healthcare provider organizations could increase the concentration of credit risk. The factors affecting our customers ability to make timely payments according to the contractual lease terms are out of our control, and as a result, exposes us to additional risks that may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The occurrence of any such factors affecting our customers may cause delays in payments or, in some cases, defaults on payment obligations, which could result in material losses. 
 The programs we have designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk may not be successful. There can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing credit risks relating to these lease financing arrangements. If the level of credit losses we experience in the future exceed our expectations, such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or adversely affect our ability to sell such assets as part of our monetization strategy. 
 We may be unable to accurately forecast customer demand and our inventory levels. 
 We generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods and anticipating demand for our products may be challenging as cataract surgeon demand and adoption rates can be unpredictable. In addition, as use of our Systems is adopted by more cataract surgeons, we anticipate greater fluctuations in demand for our products, which makes demand forecasting more difficult. Our forecasts are based on management s judgment and assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. If we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In connection with the commercial launch of the ALLY System, we have modified our manufacturing operations from producing the LLS to the ALLY System. We could underestimate the worldwide demand for the ALLY System and be 
 42 

unable to fulfill customer requests. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, our excess or obsolete inventory may increase significantly, which would reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our financial results. 
 Failure to secure adequate coverage or reimbursement by government or other third-party payors for certain procedures using our ALLY System or our other future products, or changes in current coverage or reimbursement, could materially impact our revenue and future growth. 
 Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs, for certain procedures using our ALLY System or other products we may develop in the future, if approved, is central to the acceptance and adoption of these products. Hospitals, healthcare facilities, physicians and other healthcare providers that may purchase and use our ALLY System generally rely on third-party payors to pay for a part of the costs and fees associated with certain procedures using our ALLY System. If third-party payors reduce their levels of payment, if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels or if third-party payors deny reimbursement for procedures using our ALLY System, our ALLY System may not be adopted or accepted by hospitals, healthcare facilities, physicians or other healthcare providers and the prices paid for a procedure using our ALLY System may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Physicians are reimbursed separately for their professional time and effort to perform a cataract procedure that is covered by third-party payors. Such party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes routine updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our ALLY System would be used. These updates could directly impact the demand for our future products. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, provided for a 0.5 annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or PFS, through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a Quality Payment Program for Medicare physicians, nurses and other eligible clinicians (as defined in MACRA) that adjusts overall reimbursement under the PFS based on certain performance categories. While MACRA applies only to Medicare reimbursement, Medicaid and private payors often follow Medicare payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in Medicare reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may result in reduced demand for our ALLY System or any other products we may develop in the future. However, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor. Many private payors require extensive documentation of a multi-step diagnosis before authorizing procedures using our products. Some private payors may apply their own coverage policies and criteria inconsistently, and physicians and other healthcare providers may not be able to receive approval and reimbursement for certain procedures using our ALLY System consistently. Any perception by physicians and other healthcare providers that the reimbursement for procedures using our ALLY System or other future products is inadequate to compensate them for the work required, including diagnosis, documentation, obtaining third-party payor approval for the procedure and other burdens on their office staff or that they may not be reimbursed at all for the procedures using our ALLY System or other future products, may negatively affect the adoption and use of our ALLY System or other future products and technologies, and the prices paid for such products may decline. 
 The healthcare industry in the United States, and in our other operating regions, has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs. Third-party payors are imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with hospitals, other healthcare facilities, surgeons and other healthcare providers and being increasingly selective about the products, technologies and procedures they chose to cover and provide reimbursement for. Third-party payors may adopt policies in the future restricting access to products and technologies like ours or the procedures performed using such products. Therefore, we cannot be certain that any procedures performed with our ALLY System or other future products will be covered and reimbursed. There can be no guarantee that should we introduce new products and technologies, third-party payors will provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for those products or the procedures in which they are used. If third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement for such products, then our sales may be limited to circumstances where our products and procedures using our products are being largely or entirely self-paid by patients, as is currently the case with procedures using our Systems. 
 Additionally, market acceptance of our products and technologies in foreign markets may depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government-sponsored healthcare and private insurance. In the EU, reimbursement is entirely regulated at member state level and varies significantly between countries, and member states are facing increased pressure to limit public healthcare spending. We may not obtain additional international coverage and reimbursement approvals in a timely manner, if at all. Our failure to receive such approvals would negatively impact future market acceptance of our ALLY System or any of other products we may develop in the future in the international markets in which those approvals are sought. 
 43 

We provide a limited warranty for our products. 
 We provide a limited warranty that our products are free of material defects and conform to specifications, and offer to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of defective products. As a result, we bear the risk of potential warranty claims on our products. In the event that we attempt to recover some or all of the expenses associated with a warranty claim against us from our suppliers or vendors, we may not be successful in claiming recovery under any warranty or indemnity provided to us by such suppliers or vendors and any recovery from such vendor or supplier may not be adequate. In addition, warranty claims brought by our customers related to third-party components may arise after our ability to bring corresponding warranty claims against such suppliers expires, which could result in costs to us. 
 Product liability suits brought against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities, limit the selling or leasing of our existing products and interfere with commercialization of any products that we may develop. 
 If our product offerings are defectively designed or manufactured, contain defective materials, or are used or deployed improperly, or if someone alleges any of the foregoing, whether or not such claims are meritorious, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could divert management s attention from our business, be expensive to defend, result in sizable damage awards against us, damage our reputation, increase our product liability insurance rates, prevent us from securing continuing coverage, or prevent or interfere with commercialization of our products. In addition, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. Product liability claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage would likely be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities. 
 We do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. We can give no assurance that the coverage under our product liability insurance in the United States will be available or adequate to satisfy any claims. Product liability insurance is expensive and subject to significant deductibles and exclusions, and may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain or maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we could be exposed to significant liabilities. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Defending a suit, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could be costly, could divert management s attention from our business and might result in adverse publicity, which could result in reduced acceptance of our products in the market, product recalls or market withdrawals. 
 We do not carry specific hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our insurance policies generally exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals and certifications could be suspended. 
 We also expect that operating as a public company will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our financial results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. 
 Our quarterly and annual results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. For example, we have historically experienced seasonal variations in the selling or leasing of our products and procedures involving our products, with our fourth quarter typically being the strongest and the first or third quarter being the slowest. We believe these seasonal changes are consistent across our industry. Other factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results include: 
 fluctuations in the demand for the more advanced, patient-pay procedures in which our Systems are used; 

44 

adoption of our LLS and ALLY Systems; 

our ability to establish and maintain an effective and dedicated sales organization in the United States and network of independent distributors outside the United States; 

pricing pressure applicable to our products from competitor pricing; 

results of clinical research and studies on our products or competitive products; 

the mix of sales and leases of our Systems; 

timing of delivery of Systems, new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors; 

decisions by surgeons, hospitals and ASCs to defer acquisitions of Systems in anticipation of the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; 

sampling by and additional training requirements for cataract surgeons upon the commercialization of a new product by us or one of our competitors; 

regulatory approvals, clearances or certifications and legislative changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors; 

interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our Systems; 

delays in, or failure of, component and raw material deliveries by our suppliers; 

the ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of components; 

the effect of competing technological, industry and market developments; and 

changes in our ability to obtain regulatory clearance, certification or approval for our product candidates. 

As a result, you should not rely on our results in any past period as an indication of future results and you should anticipate that fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results may continue and could generate volatility in the price of our common stock. Quarterly or annual comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. 
 If we fail to manage our anticipated growth effectively, or are unable to increase or maintain our manufacturing capacity, we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products and our business could suffer. 
 We have experienced significant period-to-period growth in our business, with the exception of 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and we must continue to grow in order to meet our business and financial objectives. However, continued growth may create numerous challenges, including: 
 new and increased responsibilities for our management team; 

increased pressure on our operating, financial and reporting systems; 

increased pressure to anticipate and satisfy market demand; 

additional manufacturing capacity requirements; 

strain on our ability to source a larger supply of components, including as a result of ongoing supply chain issues, in order to meet our required specifications on a timely basis; 

management of an increasing number of relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties; 

entry into new international territories with unfamiliar regulations and business approaches; 

45 

the need to hire, train and manage additional qualified personnel; and 

transitioning manufacturing from our LLS to our ALLY System. 

Our current and planned capacity may not be sufficient to meet our current business plans. There are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities, and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner. For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility or launch new products. Also, we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand as we introduce new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline. If we fail to manage any of the above challenges effectively, our business may be harmed. 
 If we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or to successfully integrate them in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner. 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures and advances in technologies. Accordingly, although we have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment, we may in the future pursue the acquisition of, or joint ventures relating to, complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves. We do not know if we will be able to successfully complete any future acquisitions or joint ventures, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology or retain any key employees related thereto. Integrating any business, product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time-consuming, disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management. If we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business will be adversely affected. In addition, any amortization or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could increase our expenses. 
 Our future growth depends on our ability to retain members of our senior management and other key employees. If we are unable to retain or recruit qualified personnel for growth, our business results could suffer. 
 We have benefited substantially from the leadership and performance of our senior management as well as certain key employees. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management and key employees, and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management and key employees in our industry is intense, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our personnel or attract new, qualified personnel, or that we will be able to do so without incurring substantial additional costs. We have begun to experience increases in compensation levels in connection with our recruitment and retention efforts, which may increase further in the future. The loss of services of certain members of our senior management or key employees could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic objectives, or divert management s attention to seeking qualified replacements. Each member of senior management as well as our key employees may terminate employment without notice and without cause or good reason. The members of our senior management are not subject to non-competition agreements. Accordingly, the adverse effect resulting from the loss of certain members of senior management could be compounded by our inability to prevent them from competing with us. 
 In addition to competing for market share for our products, we also compete against our competitors for personnel, including qualified sales representatives that are necessary to grow our business. Universities and research institutions also compete with us for scientific personnel that are important to our research and development efforts. We also rely on consultants and advisors in our research, operations, clinical and commercial efforts to implement our business strategies. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. Our strategic plan requires us to continue growing our sales, marketing, clinical and operational infrastructure in order to generate, and meet, the demand for our products. If we fail to retain or attract these key personnel, we could fail to take advantage of the market for our products, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 We rely significantly on the use of information technology. Cybersecurity risks any technology failures causing a material disruption to operational technology or cyber-attacks on our systems affecting our ability to protect the integrity and security of confidential customer and employee information could harm our reputation and/or could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business. 
 The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to store and effectively manage sales and marketing data, accounting and financial functions, inventory management, product development tasks, clinical data, customer service and technical support functions, intellectual property, proprietary business information and certain personal information, including of our employees and contractors (collectively Confidential Information). The 
 46 

future operation, success and growth of our business depends on streamlined processes made available through our uninhibited access to information technology systems, global communications, internet activity and other network processes. 
 Like most companies, despite our current security measures, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to information security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses and interruption, theft or loss of Confidential Information. Confidential Information might be improperly accessed due to a variety of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. In addition, a variety of our software systems are cloud-based data management applications, hosted by third-party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks. We have technology security initiatives in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but there can be no assurance that our or our third-party service providers cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including policies, controls or procedures and other security measures will be adequately designed, complied with, implemented or effective to ensure that our or their operations are not disrupted or that data security breaches do not occur. 
 Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks which may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. We and certain of our service providers are from time to time subject to cyberattacks and security incidents. Any significant information technology system failure, accident or security breach could cause interruptions in our operations, result in damage to our reputation, the loss or misappropriation of Confidential Information, result in key personnel being unable to perform duties or communicate throughout the organization, significant costs associated with the investigation, data restoration and remediation, and potential notification of the breach to third-parties, including counter-parties and data subjects, and have other adverse impacts on our business. Ransomware attacks, including those from organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, and if made against us could lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of Confidential Information and income, reputational loss, diversion of funds, and may also result in fines, litigation and unwanted media attention. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting payments. Despite our existing security procedures and controls, if our network were compromised, it could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships, decrease sales and leases of our products, increase overhead costs, harm our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, result in regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, result in fines or litigation, and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud. 
 The costs of mitigating cybersecurity risks are significant and are likely to increase in the future. These costs include, but are not limited to, retaining the services of cybersecurity providers; compliance costs arising out of existing and future cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws and regulations; and costs related to maintaining redundant networks, data backups and other damage-mitigation measures. 
 We do not carry cyber insurance, which may expose us to certain potential losses for damages or result in penalization with fines in an amount exceeding our resources. 
 The actual or perceived failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and other obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our business processes health-related and other personal information. When conducting clinical studies, we face risks associated with collecting trial participants information, especially health information, in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations. We also face risks inherent in handling large volumes of Confidential Information and in protecting the security of such information. We could be subject to attacks on our information technology systems by outside parties or fraudulent or inappropriate behavior by our service providers or employees. Third parties may also gain access to users accounts using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks or other means, and may use such access to obtain users personal information or prevent use of their accounts. Data breaches could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection and other laws, and subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state and local regulatory entities in the United States and by international regulatory entities, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability, or both. Further, our general liability insurance and corporate risk program may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. 
 We may be subject to state, federal and foreign laws relating to data privacy and security in the conduct of our business, including state breach notification laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or, collectively, HIPAA, the EU s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and 
 47 

applicable national supplementing laws, or GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, or, collectively, CCPA. In the United States, HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information on covered entities, including healthcare providers and research institutions, from which we obtain clinical trial data, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting such information for or on behalf of such covered entities, and their covered subcontractors. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to regulatory investigation and enforcement action, including significant penalties, if we violate HIPAA. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, which govern the privacy, processing and protection of health-related and other personal information. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. For example, the CCPA requires certain businesses that process personal information of California residents to, among other things: provide certain disclosures to California residents regarding the business s collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information; receive and respond to requests from California residents to access, delete, and correct their personal information, or to opt-out of certain disclosures of their personal information; and enter into specific contractual provisions with service providers that process California resident personal information on the business s behalf. Similar laws have been passed in other states, and continue to be proposed at the state and federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. This legislation may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs, could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. 
 Furthermore, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and many state Attorneys General continue to enforce federal and state consumer protection laws against companies for online collection, use, dissemination and security practices that appear to be unfair or deceptive. The FTC has authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities that make deceptive statements about privacy and data sharing in privacy policies, fail to limit third-party use of personal health information, fail to implement policies to protect personal health information or engage in other unfair practices that harm customers. For example, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers personal information secure can constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by FTC and state Attorneys General to regulate the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content. 
 The GDPR imposes comprehensive compliance obligations regarding our processing of personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or EEA, or in the context of our activities within the EEA, including a principle of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate that appropriate legal bases are in place to justify data processing activities. Additionally, we are subject to laws and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EEA and the United States remains uncertain. Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union states that reliance on the standard contractual clauses, or SSCs - a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism - alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The European Commission adopted its Adequacy Decision in relation to the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or DPF, on July 10, 2023, rendering the DPF effective as a GDPR transfer mechanism to U.S. entities self-certified under the DPF. 
 We currently rely on the SCCs to transfer personal data outside the EEA and the UK, including to the United States, with respect to both intragroup and third party transfers. We expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, we expect the DPF Adequacy Decision to be challenged and international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to be subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, or other jurisdictions, we could be prevented from transferring personal data of individuals in those regions; we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines; we may have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes; we will have to implement revised SSCs for existing arrangements within required time frame; and/or it could otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we provide our services and thus materially affect our operations and financial results. Failure to comply with the GDPR could result in penalties for certain breaches of up to the greater of EUR 20 million or 4 of our global annual turnover. In addition to fines, a breach of the GDPR may result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our data processing activities, enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) and/ or civil claims (including class actions). 
 We are also subject to the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018, which collectively impose separate but similar obligations to those under the GDPR and comparable penalties, including fines of up to 17.5 million or 4 of a noncompliant undertaking s global annual revenue for the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. On October 12, 2023, the UK 
 48 

Extension to the DPF came into effect (as approved by the UK Government), as a data transfer mechanism from the UK to U.S. entities self-certified under the DPF. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business. 
 We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, Washington State enacted a broadly applicable law to protect the privacy of personal health information known as the My Health My Data Act, which generally requires affirmative consent for the collection, use, or sharing of any consumer health data. Consumer health data is defined to include personal information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a consumer and that identifies a consumer s past, present, or future physical or mental health status; consumer health data also includes information that is derived or extrapolated from non-health information, such as algorithms and machine learning. Other states, including Connecticut and Nevada, have also passed consumer health data laws, and given the increased focus on the use of health data by entities that are not subject to HIPAA, additional states are expected to pass consumer health privacy laws. 
 Furthermore, these laws impose substantial requirements that require the expenditure of significant funds and employee time to comply, and additional states and countries are enacting new data privacy and security laws, which will require future expansion of our compliance efforts. We also rely on third parties to host or otherwise process some of this data. In some instances, these third parties have experienced immaterial failures to protect data privacy. There can be no assurances that the privacy and security-related measures and safeguards we have put in place in relation to these third parties will be effective to protect us and/ or the relevant personal information from the risks associated with the third-party processing of such data. Any failure by a third party to prevent security breaches could have adverse consequences for us, result in applicable fines and penalties, damage our reputation, and/ or result in civil claims. We will need to expend additional resources and make significant investments to comply with data privacy and security laws. Our failure to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal, state, or international privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards or other legal obligations relating to data privacy and information security or any failure to prevent security breaches of such data could result in significant liability under applicable laws, cause disruption to our business, harm our reputation, have a material adverse effect on our business, and may result in claims, complaints, liabilities, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, or may require us to change our operations. Any such claims, complaints, proceedings or actions could force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings or actions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, and result in the imposition of monetary penalties. 
 Performance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carriers could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation and ability to provide our products on a timely basis. 
 Reliable shipping is essential to our operations. We rely on providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of our products to our customers and for tracking of these shipments. Should a carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of any of our products, it would be costly to replace such products in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our products and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions affecting delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to deliver our products (or any other products we commercialize in the future) on a timely basis. 
 Intangible assets on our books may lead to significant impairment charges. 
 We carry a significant amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet, partially due to the value of the LENSAR brand name, but also intangible assets associated with our technologies, acquired research and development, currently marketed products, and marketing know-how. As a result, we have incurred and may incur significant impairment charges if the fair value of the intangible assets would be less than their carrying value on our balance sheet at any point in time. 
 We regularly review our long-lived intangible and tangible assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for impairment. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (such as the LENSAR brand name), acquired research projects not ready for use, and acquired development projects not yet ready for use are subject to impairment review. We review other long-lived assets for impairment when there is an indication that an impairment may have occurred. 
 We are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of PDL BioPharma, Inc. following the Spin-Off. 
 On October 1, 2020, we completed the Spin-Off and became an independent public company. There are several significant areas where the liabilities of PDL may become our obligations, notwithstanding the Spin-Off. For example, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the PDL consolidated U.S. federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of 
 49 

the Spin-Off is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire PDL consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In addition, the Tax Matters Agreement with PDL allocates the responsibility for taxes between PDL and us. Pursuant to this allocation, we may be responsible for taxes that we would not have otherwise incurred, or that we would have incurred but in different amounts or at different times, on a standalone basis outside of the PDL consolidated group, and the amount of such taxes could be significant. If PDL is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. 
 Potential indemnification obligations to PDL pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement could materially and adversely affect us. 
 In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company and PDL entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated September 30, 2020, or the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which sets forth the agreements between PDL and the Company regarding the principal transactions necessary to separate the Company from PDL and other agreements that govern certain aspects of the relationship with PDL after the completion of the Spin-Off. Among other things, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all of the liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Spin-Off. If we are required to indemnify PDL under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. 
 Risks Related to Government Regulation 
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business. 
 Our products are regulated as medical devices. We and our products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere, including by the FDA and its foreign counterparts. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices: design, development and manufacturing; testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage; clinical studies; product safety; establishment registration and device listing; marketing, sales and distribution; pre-market clearance, certification and approval; record keeping procedures; advertising and promotion; recalls and field safety corrective actions; post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; post-market approval or certification studies; and product import and export. 
 The regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may change their policies, adopt additional regulations, revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. We may be found non-compliant as a result of future changes in. or interpretations of, regulations by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. For example, on February 23, 2022, the FDA issued a proposed rule to amend the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which establishes current good manufacturing practice requirements for medical device manufacturers, to align more closely with the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, standards. This proposal has not yet been finalized or adopted. Accordingly, it is unclear the extent to which this or any other proposals, if adopted, could impose additional or different regulatory requirements on us that could increase the costs of compliance or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business. 
 The FDA, foreign regulatory authorities and notified bodies enforce their regulatory requirements through, among other means, periodic unannounced inspections and audits. We do not know whether we will be found compliant in connection with any future FDA (or foreign regulatory authorities) inspections or notified bodies audits. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as: warning letters; fines; injunctions; civil penalties; termination of distribution; recalls or seizures of products; delays in the introduction of products into the market; total or partial suspension of production; refusal to grant future clearances, certifications or approvals; withdrawals or suspensions of current approvals or certifications, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and in the most serious cases, criminal penalties. 
 We may not receive, or may be delayed in receiving, the necessary clearances, certifications or approvals for our future products, or modifications to our current products, and failure to timely obtain additional clearances, certifications or approvals for our ALLY System and future products or modifications to our current products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business. 
 In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, or approval of a pre-market approval application, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally-marketed 
 50 

predicate device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved PMA and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. To be substantially equivalent, the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the process of obtaining PMA approval, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. To date, our products have received marketing authorization pursuant to the 510(k) clearance process. 
 Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval. Similarly, certain modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) clearance. Both the PMA approval and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials. Despite the time, effort and cost, a device may not be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the device, which may limit the market for the device. 
 In the United States, we have obtained clearance of our Systems through the 510(k) clearance process. Any modification to these Systems that has not been previously cleared may require us to submit a new 510(k) premarket notification and obtain clearance, or submit a PMA and obtain FDA approval, prior to implementing the change. Specifically, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have made modifications to 510(k)-cleared products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals were not required. We may make modifications or add additional features to our products in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications for modifications to our previously cleared products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. 
 The ALLY System, which has received clearance from the FDA, enables cataract surgeons to complete the laser-assisted procedure seamlessly in a single, sterile environment. The ALLY System is available to all U.S. and EU cataract surgeons and has also received regulatory clearance in India, Taiwan, as well as certain other countries. In addition, we are pursuing additional marketing or certification applications through our distributors in South Korea and China. 
 The FDA, foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies can delay, limit or deny clearance, certification or approval of a device for many reasons, including: 
 our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority or notified body that our products are safe or effective for their intended uses; 

the disagreement of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority or notified body with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or the interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials; 

serious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials; 

the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance, certification or approval, where required; 

our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks; 

51 

the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and 

the potential for approval or certification policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority or notified body to change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance, certification or approval. 

Subject to the transitional provisions and in order to sell our products in EU member states, our products must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the European Conformity, or CE, mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. All medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. A conformity assessment procedure generally requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be unable to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the EU and these three countries. 
 In the EU, the EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. In accordance with its recently extended transitional provisions, both (i) devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 and (ii) legacy devices lawfully placed on the market after May 26, 2021 in accordance with the transitional provisions of the EU Medical Devices Regulation may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, no substantial change must be made to the device as such a modification would trigger the obligation to obtain a new certification under the EU Medical Devices Regulation and therefore to have a notified body conducting a new conformity assessment of the devices. Once our devices are certified under the EU Medical Devices Regulation, we must inform the notified body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices that we market or sell in the EU and the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our quality system or substantial changes to our medical devices that could affect compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation or cause a substantial change to the intended use for which the device has been CE marked. The notified body will then assess the planned changes and verify whether they affect the products ongoing conformity with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. If the assessment is favorable, the notified body will issue a new certificate of conformity or an addendum to the existing certificate attesting compliance with the general safety and performance requirements and quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the EU Medical Devices Regulation. The notified body may disagree with our proposed changes and product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. 
 In the UK, on June 26, 2022, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, published its response to a 10-week consultation on the future regulation of medical devices in the United Kingdom. The MHRA proposes amendments to the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive), in particular to create new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. Regulations implementing the new regime were originally scheduled to come into force in July 2023, but the MHRA has recently updated guidance to reflect that it is now aiming for core aspects of the future regime for medical devices to apply from July 1, 2025. Medical devices bearing CE marks issued by EU notified bodies under the EU Medical Devices Regulation or EU Medical Devices Directive are now subject to transitional arrangements. Medical devices compliant with the EU Medical Devices Directive or EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive with a valid declaration and CE marking can be placed on the Great Britain market up until the sooner of expiry of certificate or June 30, 2028. Medical devices compliant with the EU Medical Devices Regulation can be placed on the Great Britain market up until June 30, 2030. Following these transitional periods, all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessed, or UKCA, mark. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis prior to the regulations coming into force; however, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. Following the transitional period, compliance with the UK regulations will be a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in the Great Britain and will continue 
 52 

to be governed according to EU requirements. These modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to conduct our business in these countries. 
 Failure to comply with post-marketing regulatory requirements could subject us to enforcement actions, including substantial penalties, and might require us to recall or withdraw a product from the market. 
 We are subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the manufacture, marketing, advertising, medical device reporting, sale, promotion, import, export, registration, and listing of devices. The regulations to which we are subject are complex and have become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to continue or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs, or lower than anticipated sales. Even after we have obtained the proper regulatory approval, certification or clearance to market a device, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations and applicable foreign laws and regulations. The FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies, which may include any of the following sanctions: 
 untitled letters or warning letters; 

fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

recalls, termination of distribution, administrative detention, or seizure of our products; 

customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds; 

operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

delays in or refusal to grant our requests for future clearances, certifications or approvals (including foreign regulatory approvals) of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products; 

withdrawals or suspensions of our current 510(k) clearances or certifications, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; 

FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and 

criminal prosecution. 

Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change their clearance or certification policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay clearance, certification or approval of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared or certified products on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new clearances, certifications or approvals, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our clearances of our current products. For more information, see Legislative or regulatory reforms in the United States or the EU may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances, certifications or approvals for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance, certification or approval is obtained . 
 Our products must be manufactured in accordance with federal, state and foreign regulations, and we or any of our suppliers could be forced to recall products or terminate production if we fail to comply with these regulations. 
 The methods used in, and the facilities used for, the manufacture of our products must comply with the FDA s QSR, which is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, handling, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and shipping of medical devices. Furthermore, we are required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality standards and applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of subcontractors. Our products are also subject to similar state regulations and various laws and regulations of foreign countries governing manufacturing. 
 53 

Our third-party manufacturers may not take the necessary steps to comply with applicable regulations, which could cause delays in the delivery of our products. In addition, failure to comply with applicable FDA (or other regulatory authorities) requirements or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes could result in, among other things: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions or civil penalties; suspension or withdrawal of approvals or certifications; seizures or recalls of our products; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; administrative or judicially imposed sanctions; the FDA s (or foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies refusal to grant pending or future clearances, certifications or approvals for our products; clinical holds; refusal to permit the import or export of our products; and criminal prosecution of us or our employees. 
 Any of these actions could significantly and negatively affect supply of our products. If any of these events occurs, our reputation could be harmed, we could be exposed to product liability claims and we could lose customers and experience reduced sales and increased costs. 
 The misuse or off-label use of our LLS or ALLY System may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business. 
 Our Systems are ophthalmic surgical lasers indicated for the creation of anterior capsulotomies, use in patients undergoing surgery requiring laser-assisted fragmentation of the cataractous lens, and for creating cuts/incisions in the cornea. We train our marketing personnel and direct sales force to not promote our devices for uses outside of the FDA-approved indications for use, known as off-label uses. We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our devices off-label, when in the physician s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our devices off-label. Furthermore, the use of our devices for indications other than those approved by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority or certified by a notified body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients. 
 If the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of an untitled letter, which is used for violators that do not necessitate a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations. 
 In addition, physicians may misuse our products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our devices are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. 
 Our products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events or be subject to failures or malfunctions that we are required to report to the FDA (or similar foreign authorities), and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. The discovery of serious safety issues with our products, or a recall of our products either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us. 
 We are subject to the FDA s medical device reporting regulations and similar foreign regulations, which require us to report to the FDA (or similar foreign authorities) when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA (or similar foreign authorities) could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, certification or approval, seizure of our products or delay in clearance, certification or approval of future products. 
 The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or 
 54 

voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. Product defects or other errors may occur in the future. 
 Depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product s deficiencies or defects, the FDA (or foreign regulatory authorities) may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new clearances, certifications or approvals for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such clearances, certifications or approvals may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including warning letters from the FDA (or foreign regulatory authorities), product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties or civil or criminal fines. 
 Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA (or similar foreign authorities). We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA (or similar foreign authorities). If the FDA (or similar foreign authorities) disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us and negatively affect our sales. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results. 
 If we do not obtain and maintain international regulatory registrations, clearances, certifications or approvals for our products, we will be unable to market and sell our products outside of the United States. 
 Sales of our products outside of the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the United States. While the regulations of some countries may not impose barriers to marketing and selling our products or only require notification, others require that we obtain the clearance, certification or approval of a specified regulatory body. Complying with foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining registrations, clearances, certifications or approvals, can be expensive and time-consuming, and we may not receive regulatory clearances, certifications or approvals in each country in which we plan to market our products or we may be unable to do so on a timely basis. The time required to obtain registrations, clearances, certifications or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such registrations, clearances, certifications or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. If we modify our products, we may need to apply for additional regulatory clearances, certifications or approvals before we are permitted to sell the modified product. In addition, we may not continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the authorizations (approvals or certifications) that we have received. If we are unable to maintain our authorizations or certifications in a particular country, we will no longer be able to sell the applicable product in that country. 
 Regulatory clearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure registration, clearance, certification or approval by regulatory authorities or notified bodies in other countries, and registration, clearance, certification or approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies does not ensure registration, clearance, certification or approval by regulatory authorities or notified bodies in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining registration or regulatory clearance, certification or approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. 
 The clinical trial process is lengthy and expensive with uncertain outcomes. Results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, or the safety or efficacy profile for such products. 
 Clinical testing is difficult to design and implement, can take many years, can be expensive and carries uncertain outcomes. We intend to conduct additional clinical trials and to generate clinical data that will help us demonstrate the benefits of our system compared to manual cataract surgery conducted without a laser system, or with competing laser systems. 
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products conducted to date and ongoing or future studies and trials of our current, planned or future products may not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Our interpretation of data and results from our clinical trials do not ensure that we will achieve similar results in future clinical trials. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their products performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials have nonetheless failed to replicate results in later clinical trials. Products in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. Failure can occur at any stage of clinical testing. Our clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators or notified bodies may require us, to conduct additional clinical and non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned. 
 55 

The initiation and completion of any of clinical studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons. We may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials for a number of reasons, which could adversely affect the costs, timing or successful completion of our clinical trials, including related to the following: 
 we may be required to submit an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application to FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing certain human clinical trials of medical devices, and FDA may reject our IDE application and notify us that we may not begin clinical trials, and similar risks may apply in foreign jurisdictions; 

regulators and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials; 

regulators, Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, or other reviewing bodies may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, or to conduct or continue a clinical trial at a prospective or specific trial site; 

we may not reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites; 

clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators or notified bodies may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; 

the number of subjects or patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate, and the number of clinical trials being conducted at any given time may be high and result in fewer available patients for any given clinical trial, or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; 

our third-party contractors, including those manufacturing products or conducting clinical trials on our behalf, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; 

we might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; 

we may have to amend clinical trial protocols or conduct additional studies to reflect changes in regulatory requirements or guidance, which we may be required to submit to an IRB (or other reviewing bodies), regulatory authorities, or both, for re-examination; 

regulators, IRBs, other reviewing bodies, or other parties may require or recommend that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety signals or noncompliance with regulatory requirements; 

the cost of clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate; 

clinical sites may not adhere to the clinical protocol or may drop out of a clinical trial; 

we may be unable to recruit a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; 

regulators, IRBs, or other reviewing bodies may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with our manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreement for clinical and commercial supplies, the supply of devices or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply; 

approval or certification policies or regulations of FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies may change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for certification or approval; and 

our current or future products may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics. 

Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, any further disruptions related to public health crises, such as a resurgence of COVID-19, may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval or certification of our product candidates.

Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient follow-up depend on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, patient compliance, competing clinical trials and clinicians and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and efficacy of a product candidate, or they may be persuaded to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of a competitor s product candidate. In addition, patients participating in our clinical trials may drop out before completion of the trial or experience adverse medical events unrelated to our products. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may delay commencement or completion of the clinical trial, cause an increase in the costs of the clinical trial and delays, or result in the failure of the clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, and are subject to oversight by these governmental agencies and IRBs, or other reviewing bodies, at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of our devices produced under cGMP, requirements and other regulations. Furthermore, we rely on CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. We depend on our collaborators and on medical institutions and CROs to conduct our clinical trials in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements. To the extent our collaborators or the CROs fail to enroll participants for our clinical trials, fail to conduct the study to GCP standards or are delayed for a significant time in the execution of trials, including achieving full enrollment, we may be affected by increased costs, program delays or both. In addition, clinical trials that are conducted in countries outside the United States may subject us to further delays and expenses as a result of increased shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of non-U.S. CROs, as well as expose us to risks associated with clinical investigators who are unknown to the FDA, and different standards of diagnosis, screening and medical care. 
 Even if our future products are cleared or approved in the United States, commercialization of our products in foreign countries would require clearance, certification or approval by regulatory authorities or notified bodies in those countries. Clearance, certification or approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Legislative or regulatory reforms in the United States or the EU may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances, certifications or approvals for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance, certification or approval is obtained. 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. The FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. Accordingly, it is unclear the extent to which any proposals, if adopted, could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances, or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business. 
 More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional safety and performance based premarket review pathway for manufacturers of certain, well-understood device types to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list device types appropriate for the safety and performance based pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the recommended testing methods where feasible. The FDA may establish performance criteria for classes of devices for which we or our competitors seek or currently have received clearance, and it is unclear the extent to which such performance standards, if established, could impact our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business. 
 57 

In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping. The FDA s and other regulatory authorities policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory clearance or approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 
 In addition, the regulatory landscape related to medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On May 26, 2021, the EU Medical Devices Regulation became applicable, and repealed and replaced the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them) in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. 
 The modifications brought by this new Regulation may have an effect on the way we intend to develop our business in the EU and EEA. For example, as a result of the transition towards the new regime, notified body review times have lengthened, and product introductions or modifications could be delayed, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business in a timely manner. 
 Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies and notified bodies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business. 
 The ability of the FDA, foreign regulatory agencies and notified bodies to review and clear, certify or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA s, foreign regulatory agencies and notified bodies ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA s, foreign regulatory agencies and notified bodies ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA, foreign regulatory agencies and notified bodies have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA, foreign regulatory agencies and notified bodies may also slow the time necessary for new medical devices or modifications to cleared, certified or approved medical devices to be reviewed and cleared, certified or approved by necessary government agencies (or other notified bodies), which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities. 
 Separately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA postponed most inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities at various points. Even though the FDA has since resumed standard inspection operations of domestic facilities where feasible, the FDA has continued to monitor and implement changes to its inspectional activities to ensure the safety of its employees and those of the firms it regulates, and any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or emergence of new variants may lead to further inspectional delays. Regulatory authorities outside the United States have also adopted similar restrictions or other policy measures at times in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in the future. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities or notified bodies from conducting their regular inspections, audits, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA, or other regulatory authorities or notified bodies, to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 In the EU, notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Their designation process, which is significantly stricter under the new Regulation, has experienced considerable delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a recent increase in designations, the current number of notified bodies designated under the new Regulation remains significantly lower than the number of notified bodies designated under the previous regime. The current designated notified bodies are therefore facing a backlog of requests as a consequence of which review times have lengthened. This situation may impact the way we are conducting our business in the EU and the EEA and the ability of our notified body to timely review and process our regulatory submissions and perform its audits.

Enacted and future healthcare legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our ALLY System or other products we may develop in the future and may affect the prices we may set. 
 In the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives and judicial challenges to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the United States medical device industry. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA that may impact our business or financial condition. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. 
 Moreover, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures and could seriously harm our business. 
 For EU states, in December 2021, the EU Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. While the Regulation entered into force in January 2022, it will only begin to apply from January 2025 onwards, with preparatory and implementation-related steps to take place in the interim. Once applicable, it will have a phased implementation depending on the concerned products. The Regulation intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices, and provide the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. It will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the highest potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. 
 We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the United States, the EU or any other jurisdiction. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or successfully market our ALLY System or any other products we may develop and obtain clearance for in the future. 
 We may be subject to certain federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties. 
 Although none of the procedures using our products are currently covered by any state, federal or foreign government healthcare programs or other third-party payors, applicable agencies and regulators may interpret that our commercial, research and other financial relationships with healthcare providers, institutions and GPOs are nonetheless subject to various federal, state and foreign laws intended to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse, including the following: 
 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts and free or reduced price items and services. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 

59 

the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers. The federal False Claims Act has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed or for services that are not medically necessary. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act also includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, also created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 

the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members; 

analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers and self-pay patients; state laws that require device manufacturers to comply with the industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to track gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and 

EU and other foreign law equivalents of each of the laws, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. 
 We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties. 
 A majority of our revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States and is subject to requirements under the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control, anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. The FCPA prohibits, among other things, improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice has increased its enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. 
 Our safeguards to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may be ineffective. Any violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, and would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations. 
 60 

Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, distributors and contract research organizations may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements. 
 We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, distributors and contractor research organizations, or CROs, may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. While we have policies and procedures in place prohibiting such activity, misconduct by these parties could include among other infractions or violations intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: (i) FDA (and foreign regulatory authorities regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA (or foreign regulatory authorities); (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data; or (v) other commercial or regulatory laws or requirements. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property Matters 
 Our success will depend on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. 
 Our commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining issued patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights in the United States and elsewhere and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies we have acquired in the marketplace and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. 
 We rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our products, brands, technologies and data. These legal measures afford only limited protection, and competitors or others may gain access to or use our intellectual property and proprietary information. Our success will depend, in part, on preserving our trade secrets, maintaining the security of our data and know-how and obtaining and maintaining other intellectual property rights. We may not be able to obtain or maintain intellectual property or other proprietary rights necessary to our business or in a form that provides us with a competitive advantage. 
 In addition, our efforts to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, clients and other vendors who have access to such information, our trade secrets, data and know-how may not prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, and could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by third parties. Our intellectual property, including trademarks, could be challenged, invalidated, infringed, and circumvented by third parties, and our trademarks could also be diluted, declared generic or found to be infringing on other marks. If any of the foregoing occurs, we could be forced to re-brand our products, resulting in loss of brand recognition and requiring us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands, and suffer other competitive harm. Third parties may also adopt trademarks similar to ours, which could harm our brand identity and lead to market confusion. 
 Failure to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights necessary to our business and failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and cause us to incur significant expenses. The intellectual property laws and other statutory and contractual arrangements in the United States and other jurisdictions may not provide sufficient protection in the future to prevent the infringement, use, violation or misappropriation of our trademarks, data, technology and other intellectual property and services, and may not provide an adequate remedy if our intellectual property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. 
 We rely, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, expand, enforce, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio or other proprietary rights, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the filing, licensing, defending and enforcing of any patents or other intellectual property rights. The process of applying for and obtaining a patent is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable 
 61 

patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous, or we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights at all. We may not be successful in protecting our proprietary rights, and unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
 We own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications. As of September 30, 2024, we owned approximately 64 U.S. patents, 31 pending U.S. patent applications, 170 issued foreign patents, and 85 pending foreign and Patent Cooperation Treaty applications. The patent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal and factual questions, and therefore, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 Though an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent, or denial or the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we may own may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision may result in a third party receiving a patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our products. 
 Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate or reverse engineer some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our patents, or develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. We may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors, former employees and current employees. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, including the protection of surgical and medical methods, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. 
 In addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering our products are invalidated or found unenforceable, or if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our products, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights. 
 The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that: 
 any of our patents, or any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect our products; 

any of our pending patent applications will issue as patents; 

we will be able to successfully commercialize our products on a substantial scale, if approved, before our relevant patents we may have expire; 

we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and pending patent applications; 

we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions; 

others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents; 

any of our patents will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable; 

any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; 

we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or 

our commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others. 

Even if we are able to obtain patent protection, such patent protection may be of insufficient scope to achieve our business objectives. Issued patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Decisions by courts and governmental patent agencies may 
 62 

introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by or licensed to us. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own products and practicing our own technology. Alternatively, third parties may seek approval or certification to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; competitors may then be able to market products and use manufacturing and analytical processes that are substantially similar to ours. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives. 
 Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 
 The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Even if a lapse is cured, reviving the patent or application, there is a risk that the revival can be challenged by third parties in proceeding and litigation, and that the revival can be overruled. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Changes in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our existing and future products. 
 Future changes to existing patent law could lead to uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our patents and applications. Furthermore, U.S. and foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. In several recent patent cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of patent protection available or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws and regulations or changes to patent laws and regulations that might be enacted into law by U.S. and foreign legislative bodies and patent offices. Those changes may materially affect our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future, the value of our patents, and our ability to enforce our patents. 
 If we cannot license and maintain rights to use third-party technology on reasonable terms, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. Our licensed or acquired technology may lose value or utility or over time. 
 In the past, we have licensed technology from third parties and may choose or need to do so in the future, including to develop or commercialize new products or services. We may also need to negotiate licenses to patents or patent applications before or after introducing a commercial product, and we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses to such patents or patent applications. If we are unable to enter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the licenses or fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, our business may suffer. In addition, any technology licensed or acquired by us may lose value or utility, including as a result of a change of in the industry, in our business objectives, others technology, our dispute with the licensor, and other circumstances outside our control. In return for the use of a third party s technology, we may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of our products or services. If we are unable to negotiate reasonable royalties or if we have to pay royalties on technology that becomes less useful for us or ceases to provide value to us, our profit margin will be reduced and we may suffer losses. 
 We may become a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell and market our products. 
 The medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications or trademarks controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products, or that we may be accused of misappropriating third parties trade secrets. Additionally, our products include components that we purchase from vendors, and may include design components that are outside of our direct control. Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios, trade secrets, trademarks, 
 63 

and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents or trademarks that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, sell or export our products or to use our technologies or product names. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups that are non-practicing entities, commonly referred to as patent trolls, have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements. From time to time, we may receive threatening letters, notices or invitations to license, or may be the subject of claims that our products and business operations infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these matters can be time consuming and costly to defend in litigation, divert management s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand and cause us to incur significant expenses or make substantial payments. Vendors from whom we purchase hardware or software may not indemnify us in the event that such hardware or software is accused of infringing a third-party s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third-party s trade secret. 
 Since patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our products. Because of the confidential nature of patent applications, we do not know at any given time what patent applications are pending that may later issue as a patent and be asserted by a third party against us. Competitors may also contest our patents, if issued, by showing the patent examiner that the invention was not original, was not novel, or was invalid or unenforceable for other reasons. In litigation or administrative proceedings, a competitor could claim that our patents, if issued, are not valid for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would lose our rights to those challenged patents or have the scope of those rights narrowed. 
 In addition, we may in the future be subject to claims by our former employees or consultants asserting an ownership right in our patents, patent applications or other intellectual property, as a result of the work they performed on our behalf. Our general requirement that our employees and consultants and any other partners or collaborators who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology assign or grant similar rights to their inventions to us may not fully protect us from intellectual property claims. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have contributed to our intellectual property, nor can we be certain that our agreements with such parties will be upheld in the face of a potential challenge, that such agreements will adequately protect us, or that they will not be breached, for which we may not have an adequate remedy. 
 Any lawsuits relating to intellectual property rights could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following: 
 stop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property; 

lose the opportunity to license our intellectual property to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others; incur significant legal expenses; 

pay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; 

pay the attorney s fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; 

redesign those products or technologies that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly and disruptive, and may be infeasible; and 

attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or from third parties who may attempt to license rights that they do not have. 

Any litigation or claim against us, even those without merit and even those where we prevail, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages, including third-party lost profits, the disgorgement of our profits, or substantial royalties (all of which may be increased, including three times the awarded damages, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade secrets) and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Although patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property disputes in the medical device area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. We could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products, and these alternative methods or products may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our competitive business position. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or 
 64 

technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products. 
 In addition, we generally indemnify our customers with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. However, third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed or settle, we may be forced to pay damages or settlement payments on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products. 
 
 Similarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine priority with respect to our patents, patent applications, trademarks or trademark applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as reexamination, inter parties review, post grant review, derivation or opposition proceedings before the USPTO or other jurisdictional body relating to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing our products or using product names, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Additionally, we may file lawsuits or initiate other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. Competitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent or other intellectual property infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent or other intellectual property of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent s claims or other intellectual property narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents or other intellectual property do not cover the technology in question. Furthermore, even if our patents or other intellectual property are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer s competition in the market. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents or other intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our other proprietary information, our business and competitive position may be harmed. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on protection of trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and some courts are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, we rely heavily on confidentiality provisions that we have in contracts with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others upon the commencement of their relationship with us. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by such third parties, despite the existence generally of these confidentiality restrictions. These contracts may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event the unwanted use is outside the scope of the provisions of the contracts or in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information. There can be no assurance that such third parties will not breach their agreements with us, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. The protections we place on our intellectual property or other proprietary rights may not be sufficient. Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property or other proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries will not protect our intellectual property or other proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad, which could affect our ability to expand to international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology. To the extent our intellectual property or other proprietary information protection is incomplete, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology, or develop similar technology. Our competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or design around our protected technology. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our products, brand and business. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our products and harm our business, the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their 
 65 

confidential or proprietary information. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Further, it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or products or otherwise work around our patented technology, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions. If we fail to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or if our competitors obtain our trade secrets or independently develop technology or products similar to ours or competing technologies or products, our competitive market position could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated confidential information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breach. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 
 A company may attempt to commercialize competing products utilizing our proprietary design, trademarks or trade names in foreign countries where we do not have any patents or patent applications and where legal recourse may be limited. This may have a significant commercial impact on our foreign business operations. 
 Filing, prosecuting and defending patents or trademarks on our current and future products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability and trademarking may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights including the protection of surgical and medical methods, to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from utilizing our inventions and trademarks in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies or trademarks in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent or trademark protection to develop or market their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent and trademark protection, but enforcement on infringing activities is inadequate. These products or trademarks may compete with our products or trademarks, and our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 
 Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents and trademarks or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent and trademarks rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents and trademarks in those jurisdictions, as well as elsewhere at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent or trademark applications at risk, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries, including India and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to our patents to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. Finally, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws. 
 We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property of a third party, including trade secrets or know-how, or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors. 
 Many of our employees and consultants were previously employed at or engaged by other medical device or other biotechnology companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors, may have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Our efforts to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us may not be successful, and we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, misappropriated the intellectual property or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information, of these former employers or competitors. 
 66 

Additionally, we may be subject to claims from third parties challenging our ownership interest in intellectual property we regard as our own, based on claims that our employees or consultants have breached an obligation to assign inventions to another employer, to a former employer, or to another person or entity. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any other claims, and it may be necessary or we may desire to enter into a license to settle any such claim; however, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations could adversely affect our business. 
 We rely on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, consultants, alliance partners and other third parties to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and manage certain parts of our business. Using these third parties poses a number of risks, such as: 
 they may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; 

they may not produce reliable results; 

they may not perform in a timely manner; 

they may not maintain confidentiality of our proprietary information; 

disputes may arise with respect to ownership of rights to technology developed with our partners, and those disputes may be resolved against us; and 

disagreements could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of our products or result in litigation or arbitration. 

Moreover, some third parties are located in markets subject to political and social risk, corruption, infrastructure problems and natural disasters, in addition to country-specific privacy and data security risk given current legal and regulatory environments. Failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations may materially affect our business. 
 If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets and our business may be adversely affected. 
 We rely on trademarks, service marks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. It is possible that some of our trademark applications may not be approved. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in proceedings before the USPTO and comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources towards advertising and marketing new brands. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. Certain of our current or future trademarks may become so well known by the public that their use becomes generic and they lose trademark protection. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Artificial Intelligence Technologies 
 We use artificial intelligence technologies in our business, and the deployment, use, and maintenance of these technologies involve significant technological and legal risks. 
 We use artificial intelligence AI ), machine learning, and automated decision-making technologies, including proprietary AI and machine learning algorithms and models (collectively, AI Technologies ), throughout our business, and are making significant investments in this area. 
 For example, we use AI Technologies in our ALLY System to register and analyze patients eyes and determine eye surface and cataract density, which helps optimize laser patterns and energy settings in cataract procedures, with the goal of minimizing the overall energy delivered in the eye for quicker visual recovery and better patient outcomes. 
 We expect that increased investment will be required in the future to continuously improve our use of AI Technologies. As with many technological innovations, there are significant risks involved in developing, maintaining and deploying these technologies and there can be no assurance that the usage of or our investments in such technologies will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. 
 In particular, if the models underlying our AI Technologies are, for example: incorrectly designed or implemented; trained or reliant on incomplete, inadequate, inaccurate, biased or otherwise poor quality data; and/or adversely impacted by unforeseen defects, technical challenges, cybersecurity threats or material performance issues, the performance of our products, services and business, as well as our reputation and the reputations of our customers, could suffer, or we could incur liability resulting from the violation of laws or contracts to which we are a party or civil claims. 
 We are in varying stages of development in relation to our products and internal business processes involving AI Technologies. The continuous development, maintenance and operation of our AI Technologies is expensive and complex and may involve unforeseen difficulties including, without limitation, material performance problems, undetected defects or errors. We may be unsuccessful in our ongoing development and maintenance of these technologies in the face of novel and evolving technical factors. Further, our ability to continue to develop or use such technologies may be dependent on access to specific third-party software, services and infrastructure, such as processing hardware, and we cannot control the availability or pricing of such third-party software and infrastructure, especially in a highly competitive environment. 
 We may not be able to obtain sufficient intellectual property protection for our AI Technologies to prevent competitors from implementing the same or similar technology in their businesses, and other individuals may apply for or obtain intellectual property protection which could limit our ability to use technology that we are currently developing. 
 A number of aspects of intellectual property protection in the field of AI and machine learning are currently under development, and there is uncertainty and ongoing litigation in different jurisdictions as to the degree and extent of protection warranted for AI and machine learning systems. If we fail to obtain protection for the intellectual property rights concerning our AI Technologies or products that incorporate AI Technologies, or later have our intellectual property rights invalidated or otherwise diminished, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition. 
 Given the long history of development of AI Technologies, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make or use our proprietary AI Technologies. 
 The regulatory framework governing the use of AI Technologies is rapidly evolving, and we cannot predict how future legislation and regulation will impact our ability to offer products or services that we develop which leverage AI Technologies. 
 The regulatory framework for AI Technologies is rapidly evolving as many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. Additionally, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of our AI Technologies. As a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, or standards may have on our business and may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations. 
 Already, certain existing legal regimes (e.g., relating to data privacy) regulate certain aspects of AI Technologies, and new laws regulating AI Technologies are expected to enter into force in the United States and the EU in 2024. In the United States, the Biden administration issued a broad Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (the 2023 AI Order that sets out principles intended to guide AI design and deployment for the public and private sector and signals the 
 68 

increase in governmental involvement and regulation over AI Technologies. The 2023 AI Order established certain new requirements for the training, testing and cybersecurity of sophisticated AI models and large-scale compute centers used to train AI models. The 2023 AI Order also instructed several other federal agencies to promulgate additional regulations within specific timeframes from the date of the 2023 AI Order regarding the use and development of AI Technologies. Already agencies such as the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission have issued proposed rules governing the use and development of AI Technologies. Legislation related to AI Technologies has also been introduced at the federal level and is advancing at the state level. For example, on March 13, 2024, Utah passed the Utah AI Policy Act, which took effect in May 2024, imposing certain disclosure requirements on the use of AI, and on May 17, 2024, Colorado enacted the Colorado AI Act, which will take effect in February 2026. Further, the California Privacy Protection Agency is currently in the process of finalizing regulations under the CCPA regarding the use of automated decision-making. In September 2024, California Governor Newsom signed seventeen new bills that further regulate use of AI Technologies and provide consumers with additional protections around companies use of AI Technologies, such as requiring companies to disclose certain uses of generative AI. These new bills may affect how we use AI Technologies in our business. For example, AB 1008 amends the CCPA to clarify that AI Technologies can generate output that is considered personal information, which would mean that California consumers have a right to request that such personal information generated by AI Technologies be deleted or corrected, pursuant to their rights under the CCPA. Such additional regulations may impact our ability to develop, use and commercialize AI Technologies in the future. 
 
 In Europe, on May 21, 2024, the European Union legislators approved the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the EU AI Act ), which establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The EU AI Act is expected to enter into force on August 1, 2024, and the majority of the substantive requirements will apply two years later. The EU AI Act will apply to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the EU and includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and proposes fines for breach of up to 7 of worldwide annual turnover. In addition, on September 28, 2022, the European Commission proposed two Directives seeking to establish a harmonized civil liability regime for AI in the EU, in order to facilitate civil claims in respect of harm caused by AI and to include AI-enabled products within the scope of the EU s existing strict product liability regime. Once fully applicable, the EU AI Act and the Liability Directives will have a material impact on the way AI is regulated in the EU. Further, in Europe we are subject to the GDPR, which regulates our use of personal data for automated decision making that results in a legal or similarly significant effect on an individual and provides rights to individuals in respect of that automated decision making. Recent case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU has taken an expansive view of the scope of the GDPR s requirements around automated decision making and introduced uncertainty in the interpretation of these rules. Specifically, the CJEU has expanded the scope for automated decision making under the GDPR by finding that automated decision-making activities can fall within the GDPR s restrictions on those activities even if the required legal or similarly significant effect for the individual is carried out by a third party. The EU AI Act, and developing interpretation and application of the GDPR in respect of automated decision making, together with developing guidance and/or decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI Technologies and our ability to provide, improve or commercialize our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, and result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. 
 
 It is possible that further new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and in other non-U.S. jurisdictions, or that existing laws and regulations, including competition and antitrust laws, may be interpreted in ways that would limit our ability to use AI Technologies for our business, or require us to change the way we use AI Technologies in a manner that negatively affects the performance of our products, services, and business and the way in which we use AI Technologies. We may need to expend resources to adjust our products or services in certain jurisdictions if the laws, regulations, or decisions are not consistent across jurisdictions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws, regulations, or decisions and/or guidance interpreting existing laws could be significant and would increase our operating expenses (such as by imposing additional reporting obligations regarding our use of AI Technologies). Such an increase in operating expenses, as well as any actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock 
 The large number of shares eligible for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock. 
 Members of our management and our board of directors hold or beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock and may sell their shares of our common stock to the extent not restricted by contract or under securities laws. We have filed registration statements registering shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plan and employee stock purchase plan. In addition, we have filed a resale registration statement registering shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and exercise of outstanding Warrants. The total number of shares of common stock offered under the resale registration statement represented approximately 51.5 of our total outstanding shares of common stock based on our shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024, assuming full conversion of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and full exercise of the Warrants for cash. We may file additional registration statements relating to shares or awards held by our management and board of 
 69 

directors in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, and such declines may be significant. The perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities. 
 We also may issue our shares of common stock from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares that we may issue may in turn be significant. In addition, we may also grant registration rights covering those shares in connection with any such acquisitions and investments . 
 We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, while we are an emerging growth company (1) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) we will be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor s report on financial statements, (3) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (4) we will not be required to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 In addition, we are eligible to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards apply to private companies, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. 
 We also currently intend to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements regarding executive compensation. We are also entitled to take advantage of other exemptions, including the exemptions from the advisory vote requirements and executive compensation disclosures under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Customer Protection Act, and the exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2025 (the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the spin-off), though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including (1) if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of any June 30, in which case we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of December 31, (2) if our gross revenue exceeds 1.235 billion in any fiscal year or (3) if we issue more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible notes in any three-year period. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
 If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile. 
 We have issued shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock, and may in the future issue additional shares of preferred stock, with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, privileges, preferences, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, terms of redemption and relative participation, optional, or other rights, if any, of the shares of each such series of preferred stock and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 
 Pursuant to the SPA, we issued an aggregate of 20,000 shares of a newly established series of preferred stock designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share, which have a stated value of 1,000 per share and are convertible into shares 
 70 

of common stock. Holders of shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with holders of shares of common stock. In addition, so long as NR-GRI and its affiliates collectively beneficially own at least twenty percent of the securities issued pursuant to the SPA, including the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not, without the consent of NR-GRI, liquidate, dissolve, or wind up our affairs or effect a merger or sale of the Company or other Fundamental Transaction (as defined in Note 11, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock , included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report); create, authorize, or issue shares of capital stock that are senior or pari passu to the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock; complete an acquisition with consideration above 1.0 million; incur debt in excess of 1.0 million; change our line of business; or enter into certain related-party transactions. 
 The Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock as to distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, and holders of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock will participate with the holders of the common stock on an as-converted basis to the extent any dividends are declared on common stock. Holders of Series A Redeemable Convertible preferred stock are also entitled to redemption rights under certain circumstances. The redemption rights and liquidation preferences assigned to holders of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, and any other repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we may assign to holders of preferred stock in the future, could affect the residual value of the common stock. 
 North Run and its affiliates ownership may limit or preclude other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters. 
 North Run Capital, LP, or North Run, and its affiliates held 46.3 of the voting power of our capital stock based on shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024, in addition North Run may acquire additional shares of common stock and voting power upon exercise of the Warrants. For as long as North Run and its affiliates hold a significant amount of our Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and common stock, they will be able to exert significant control over us. This concentrated control may limit or preclude other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that stockholders may believe are in their best interest. North Run and its affiliates may also determine to sell substantial amounts of our securities in one or more transactions, including to one or several private parties in negotiated transactions. In that case, those buyers may subsequently be able to exert significant control over us. 
 We do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment. 
 We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock. 
 Certain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our common stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things: 
 a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; 

no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 

the ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; 

the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; 

limitations on the removal of directors; 

71 

a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; 

the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president (in absence of a chief executive officer) or our board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; 

the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors is required to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors; 

the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquirer from amending the amended and restated bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and 

advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. 

These provisions may not be successful in protecting our stockholders from coercive or harmful takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with adequate time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control that is in the best interest of our stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. 
 We are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL. Under the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, our board of directors has approved the transaction. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates certain courts as the sole and exclusive forums for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Additionally, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents and arising under the Securities Act. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions described above. This forum selection provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. 
 An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained, and the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. 
 An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained, which could depress the market price of our common stock and could affect your ability to sell your shares. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report, these factors include: 
 a shift in our investor base; 

72 

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial condition and operating performance; 

the operating and stock price performance of similar companies; 

introduction of new products by us or our competitors; 

success or failure of our business strategy; 

our ability to obtain financing as needed; 

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 

the overall performance of the equity markets; 

the number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading; 

threatened or actual litigation or governmental investigations; 

changes in laws or regulations affecting our business, including tax legislation; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; 

any major change in our board of directors or management; 

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet earnings guidance; 

publication of research reports about us or our industry or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; 

large volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; 

short sales of our common stock; 

investor perception of us and our industry; and 

changes in financial markets or general economic conditions, including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the U.S. and abroad, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability, acts of war, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, acts of terrorism, natural disasters and public health crises, such as a resurgence of COVID-19. 

In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. This could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities, and suits have been initiated against us to date. For example, on August 14, 2023, two stockholders filed a Verified Amended Class Action Complaint against the Company and certain of its officers and members of the board of directors in the matter captioned Schaper v. LENSAR, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-00692-JLH (D. Del.), alleging violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14d-9 promulgated thereunder, and asserting claims challenging the adequacy of disclosures in the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on June 20, 2023. Plaintiffs filed a Verified Second Amended Class Action Complaint on January 12, 2024, alleging substantially the same claims. This type of litigation could result in very substantial costs, divert our management s attention and resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 73 

General Risk Factors 
 We are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and will be subject to other requirements that will be burdensome and costly. 
 As a public company, we are required to file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports that are specified in Section 13 of the Exchange Act. We are required to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us. 
 We expect to continue to devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including costs associated with auditing and legal fees and accounting and administrative staff. In addition, Section 404(a) under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we assess the effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our future compliance with the annual internal control report requirement will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our operating subsidiaries. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, or cause us to suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violate applicable stock exchange listing rules. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital. 
 For as long as we are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act or remain a non-accelerated filer, we will not be required to comply with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require our independent auditors to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting, until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC and the date we are no longer an emerging growth company and cease to be a non-accelerated filer. If, once we are required to comply with Section 404(b) under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our independent registered public accounting firm cannot provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence and, in turn, the market price of our common stock, could decline. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. 
 We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The design of our disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. 
 These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 If securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us were to downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts were to cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline and may also impair our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers. 
 Increasing scrutiny and stakeholder expectations regarding environmental, social, and governance matters may cause us to incur expenses and liabilities or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition, or operations. 
 Companies across industries are facing increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders related to their environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, practices. Expectations regarding voluntary ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), changes in demand for certain offerings, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 74 

While we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or goals, among others) or commitments to improve the ESG profile of our Company and/or offerings, such initiatives or achievements of such commitments may be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, certain statements in our voluntary disclosures may be based on assumptions, estimates, hypothetical expectations, or third-party information. Additionally, expectations around the Company s management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control. In addition, we may commit to certain initiatives or goals and we may not ultimately be able to achieve such commitments or goals due to factors that are within or outside of our control. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Even if this is not the case, our current actions may subsequently be determined to be insufficient by various stakeholders, and we may be subject to investor or regulator engagement on our ESG initiatives and disclosures, even if such initiatives are currently voluntary. 
 In addition, new ESG rules and regulations have been adopted and may continue to be introduced in various states and other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations could lead to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee retention. 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of 32.5 million for federal income tax purposes and 22.6 million for state income tax purposes, which may be available to offset our future taxable income, if any. Our federal NOL carryforwards are not subject to expiration, but may generally only be used to offset 80 of future taxable income in a given year. Our state NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2028. Our state NOL carryforwards could expire unused, to the extent subject to expiration, and be unavailable to offset future taxable income. 
 Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change NOL and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income and income taxes, respectively. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate change in stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders owning at least 5 of a corporation s stock exceeds 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We completed an ownership change analysis pursuant to Section 382 of the Code through our taxable year ended December 31, 2023, and determined we experienced an ownership change on May 18, 2023 in connection with the Private Placement of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or income taxes is limited as a result of such ownership change. However, we may have experienced additional ownership changes since December 31, 2023, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. If we have undergone additional ownership changes, or if we undergo ownership changes in the future, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards could be further limited.

 Item 5.	Ot her Information 
 (a) On November 5, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved and adopted amendments to the Company s second amended and restated bylaws (as amended, the Amended and Restated Bylaws ), which became effective the same day. Among other things, the amendments contained in the Amended and Restated Bylaws: 
 update advance notice disclosure requirements in connection with stockholder nominations of directors and submissions of proposals regarding other business at stockholder meetings (other than proposals to be included in the Company s proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act to require the notice from stockholders to include certain information from the stockholder providing notice, beneficial owners on whose behalf notice is made and other participants in the solicitation, and remove the requirement for the notice to include information from persons that are associates of the proposing stockholder; 

75 

address the universal proxy rules adopted by the SEC, by clarifying that no person may solicit proxies in support of a director nominee other than the Board s nominees unless such person has complied with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, including applicable notice and solicitation requirements 

enhance procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements in connection with stockholder nominations of directors and submissions of proposals regarding other business at stockholder meetings, including, without limitation, requiring certain additional background information and disclosures regarding proposing stockholders and other persons participating in a stockholder s solicitation of proxies, and regarding the proposed nominees, including a representation that such candidate intends to serve the entire term, if elected; and 

require that a stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders use a proxy card color other than white, which will be reserved for exclusive use by the Board of Directors. 

The Amended and Restated Bylaws also incorporate certain modernizing, clarifying, conforming and additional changes. 
 
 The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference. 
 (b) None. 
 (c) During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement and/or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.

 2.10	 Conduct of Business . Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence or at his or her direction by the Chief Executive Officer or in their absence, or at the direction of either the foregoing persons, by a director or officer of the Corporation. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as Secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to 
 12 | 

act as Secretary of the meeting. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures (which need not be in writing) and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the person presiding over the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present (including, without limitation, rules and procedures for removal of disruptive persons from the meeting); (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the person presiding over the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting (including, without limitation, determinations with respect to the administration and/or interpretation of any of the rules, regulations or procedures of the meeting, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the person presiding over the meeting), shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter of business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. 
 2.11	 Voting . Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws or the DGCL, each stockholder shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. 
 Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, at all duly called or convened meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, for the election of directors, a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect a director. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, each other matter presented to the stockholders at a duly called or convened meeting at which a quorum is present shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes) on such matter. 
 2.12	 Record Date for Stockholder Meetings and Other Purposes . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and 
 13 | 

which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on the next day preceding the day on which notice is first given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting; and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting. 
 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment or any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock, or for the purposes of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
 2.13	 Proxies . Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law, including Rule 14a-19 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL. A proxy may be in the form of an electronic transmission which sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the transmission was authorized by the stockholder. 
 Any stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board . 
 2.14	 List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote . The Corporation shall prepare, no later than the tenth day before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The Corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of ten (10) 
 14 | 

days ending on the day before the meeting date: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the Corporation s principal executive office. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 2.14 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. 
 2.15	 Inspectors of Election . Before any meeting of stockholders, the Corporation shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If any person appointed as inspector or any alternate fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the person presiding over the meeting shall appoint a person to fill that vacancy. 
 Such inspectors shall: 
 (i)	determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting and the validity of any proxies and ballots; 
 (ii)	count all votes or ballots; 
 (iii)	count and tabulate all votes; 
 (iv)	determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspector(s); and 
 (v)	certify its or their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and its or their count of all votes and ballots. 
 Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspection with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector s ability. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. The inspectors of election may appoint such persons to assist them in performing their duties as they determine. 
 2.16	 Delivery to the Corporation . Whenever this Article II requires one or more persons (including a record or beneficial owner of stock) to deliver a document or information to the Corporation or any officer, employee or agent thereof (including any notice, request, questionnaire, revocation, representation or other document or agreement), such document or information shall be in writing exclusively (and not in an electronic transmission) and shall be delivered exclusively by hand (including, without limitation, overnight courier service) or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and the Corporation shall not be required to accept delivery of any document not in such written form or so delivered. For the avoidance of 
 15 | 

doubt, the Corporation expressly opts out of Section 116 of the DGCL with respect to the delivery of information and documents to the Corporation required by this Article II.

 3.3	 Election, Qualification and Term of Office of Directors . Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, and subject to the Certificate of Incorporation, each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship, shall hold office until the expiration of the term of the class, if any, for which elected and until such director s successor is elected and qualified or until such director s earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Directors need not be stockholders. The Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws may prescribe qualifications for directors. 
 3.4	 Resignation and Vacancies . Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the Corporation. The resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or upon the happening of an event specified therein, and if no time or event is specified, at the time of its receipt. When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date or upon the happening of an event to occur on a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in Section 3.3. 
 Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of any director, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors, shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. 
 3.5	 Place of Meetings; Meetings by Telephone . The Board may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board, or any committee designated by the Board, may participate in a meeting of the Board, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting pursuant to this bylaw shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 
 3.6	 Regular Meetings . Regular meetings of the Board may be held within or outside the State of Delaware and at such time and at such place as which has been designated by the 
 16 | 

Board and publicized among all directors, either orally or in writing, by telephone, including a voice-messaging system or other system designed to record and communicate messages, facsimile, telegraph or telex, or by electronic mail or other means of electronic transmission. No further notice shall be required for regular meetings of the Board. 
 3.7	 Special Meetings; Notice . Special meetings of the Board for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Secretary or a majority of the total number of directors constituting the Board.

 (iii)	sent by facsimile or electronic mail; or 
 (iv)	sent by other means of electronic transmission, 
 directed to each director at that director s address, telephone number, facsimile number or electronic mail address, or other address for electronic transmission, as the case may be, as shown on the Corporation s records. 
 If the notice is (i) delivered personally by hand, by courier or by telephone, (ii) sent by facsimile or electronic mail, or (iii) sent by other means of electronic transmission, it shall be delivered or sent at least twenty-four (24) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is sent by U.S. mail, it shall be deposited in the U.S. mail at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting (if the meeting is to be held at the Corporation s principal executive office) nor the purpose of the meeting. 
 3.8	 Quorum . At all meetings of the Board, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, a majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. 
 3.9	 Board Action without a Meeting . Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission. After an action is taken, the consent or consents relating thereto shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board, or the committee thereof, in the same paper or electronic form as the minutes are maintained. Such action by written consent or consent by electronic transmission shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the Board. 
 17 | 

3.10	 Fees and Compensation of Directors . Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the Board shall have the authority to fix the compensation, including fees and reimbursement of expenses, of directors for services to the Corporation in any capacity. 
 Article IV Committees 
 4.1	 Committees of Directors . The Board may designate one (1) or more committees, each committee to consist, of one (1) or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board may designate one (1) or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) approve or adopt, or recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (ii) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the Corporation. 
 4.2	 Committee Minutes . Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board when required.

 (iii)	Section 3.7 (special meetings; notice); 
 (iv)	Section 3.9 (board action without a meeting); and

 with such changes in the context of those bylaws as are necessary to substitute the committee and its members for the Board and its members. However : 
 (i)	the time of regular meetings of committees may be determined either by resolution of the Board or by resolution of the committee; 
 (ii)	special meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the Board or the chairperson of the applicable committee; and 
 18 |

 A stock ledger consisting of one or more records in which the names of all of the Corporation s stockholders of record, the address and number of shares registered in the name of each such stockholder, and all issuances and transfers of stock of the corporation are recorded in accordance with Section 224 of the DGCL shall be administered by or on behalf of the Corporation.

The Chairperson 
 20 | 

of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, or the Secretary of the Corporation shall be specifically authorized to sign stock certificates. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 
 The Corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the Corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the Corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

Except as provided in this Section 7.4, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the Corporation and cancelled at the same time. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner s legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

 The Board may set apart out of any of the funds of the Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, and meeting contingencies. 
 7.8	 Fiscal Year . The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board and may be changed by the Board. 
 7.9	 Seal . The Corporation may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be adopted and which may be altered by the Board. The Corporation may use the corporate seal by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing the names of the persons from and to whom it was transferred. 
 7.11	 Stock Transfer Agreements . The Corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes or series of stock of the Corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the Corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the DGCL. 
 7.12	 Registered Stockholders . 
 The Corporation: 
 (i)	shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner; and

 22 | 

7.13	 Waiver of Notice . Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws. 
 Article VIII Notice 
 8.1	 Delivery of Notice; Notice by Electronic Transmission . Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provisions of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these bylaws may be given in writing directed to the stockholder s mailing address (or by electronic transmission directed to the stockholder s electronic mail address, as applicable) as it appears on the records of the Corporation and shall be given (1) if mailed, when the notice is deposited in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, (2) if delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the notice is received or left at such stockholder s address or (3) if given by electronic mail, when directed to such stockholder s electronic mail address unless the stockholder has notified the Corporation in writing or by electronic transmission of an objection to receiving notice by electronic mail. A notice by electronic mail must include a prominent legend that the communication is an important notice regarding the Corporation. 
 Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice or electronic transmission to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Corporation may give a notice by electronic mail in accordance with the first paragraph of this section without obtaining the consent required by this paragraph. 
 Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: 
 (i)	if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; 
 (ii)	if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and 
 (iii)	if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. 
 23 | 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice may not be given by an electronic transmission from and after the time that (1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by such electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices given by the Corporation and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice, provided, however, the inadvertent failure to discover such inability shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 
 An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
