 billion of assets under management and a track record of investing in the middle market. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, credit and net lease investment strategies. The Investment Adviser manages the Company's day-to-day operations and provides it with investment advisory and management services. The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to the Company's. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the "Administrator"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct the Company's day-to-day operations. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. 
 The Company conducted a private offering (the "Private Offering") of units of the Company's limited liability company interests (the "Units"). Units were offered for subscription continuously throughout the Closing Period (as defined below). Each investor in the Private Offering made a capital commitment (each, a "Capital Commitment") to purchase Units pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with the Company (each, a "Subscription Agreement"). Closings of the Private Offering occurred, from time to time, in the Investment Adviser's sole discretion, during the -month period following the initial closing of Capital Commitments, which occurred on July 15, 2019 (the "Closing Period"). Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement (as amended and restated on June 28, 2023, the "Fourth A R LLC Agreement"), the Closing Period was previously extended to and ended on October 15, 2021. The Company accepted and drew down on Capital Commitments from investors throughout the Closing Period and drew down on Capital Commitments throughout the Investment Period (as defined below). At the end of the Closing Period, the Company had aggregate Capital Commitments from investors of . The Company commenced loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial drawdown from investors in the Private Offering (the "Initial Drawdown"), which occurred on August 2, 2019 (the "Initial Drawdown Date"). The "Investment Period" began on July 15, 2019 and ended on July 15, 2023, the anniversary of such date. The term of the Company was initially until July 15, 2025, from the beginning of the Investment Period, subject to (i) a extension (the period together with any successive extensions, the "Term") as determined by the Investment Adviser in its sole discretion and (ii) an additional extension as determined by the Company's board of directors ("the Board"). Pursuant to the Fourth A R LLC Agreement, the Investment Adviser extended the Term of the Company for an additional period, to July 15, 2026. 
 The Company established New Mountain Guardian III SPV, L.L.C. ("GIII SPV") as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary, whose assets are used to secure GIII SPV's credit facility. The Company established New Mountain Guardian III OEC, Inc. ("GIII OEC") as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary, which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is intended to facilitate the Company's compliance with the requirements to be treated as a RIC under the Code by holding equity or equity-like investments in one of the Company's portfolio companies organized as a limited liability company (or other form of pass through entities). The Company consolidates this corporation for accounting purposes, but the corporation is not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may incur U.S. federal income tax expense as a result of its ownership of the portfolio company. 
 The Company focuses on providing direct lending solutions to U.S. upper middle market companies backed by top private equity sponsors. The Company's investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of senior secured loans and select junior capital positions, to growing businesses in defensive industries that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company's differentiated investment approach leverages the deep sector knowledge and operating resources of New Mountain Capital.

and . The Company focuses on defensive growth businesses that generally exhibit the following characteristics: (i) acyclicality, (ii) sustainable secular growth drivers, (iii) niche market dominance and high barriers to competitive entry, (iv) recurring revenue and strong free cash flow, (v) flexible cost structures and (vi) seasoned management teams. 
 Senior secured loans may include traditional first lien loans or unitranche loans. The Company invests a significant portion of its portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt. Certain unitranche loan investments may include last-out positions, which generally heighten the risk of loss. In some cases, the Company s investments may also include equity interests. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's top five industry concentrations were software, healthcare, business services, consumer services and distribution logistics.

Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate collectability. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current.

 For a discussion of the Company's unfunded commitments, see Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies . 
 Investment Risk Factors First and second lien debt that the Company invests in is almost entirely rated below investment grade or may be unrated. Debt investments rated below investment grade are often referred to as "leveraged loans", "high yield" or "junk" debt investments, and may be considered "high risk" compared to debt investments that are rated investment grade. These debt investments are considered speculative because of the credit risk of the issuers. Such issuers are considered more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal, and such risk of default could reduce the members' capital and income distributions of the Company. In addition, some of the Company's debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which could result in a loss or a substantial amount of unpaid principal and interest due upon maturity. First and second lien debt may also lose significant market value before a default occurs. Furthermore, an active trading market may not exist for these first and second lien debt investments. This illiquidity may make it more difficult to value the debt. 
 Subordinated debt is generally subject to similar risks as those associated with first and second lien debt, except that such debt is subordinated in payment and/or lower in lien priority. Subordinated debt is subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the borrower and the property securing the debt, if any, may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to the senior secured and unsecured obligations of the borrower. 
 The Company may directly invest in the equity of private companies or, in some cases, equity investments could be made in connection with a debt investment. Equity investments may or may not fluctuate in value, resulting in recognized realized gains or losses upon disposition.

Except as noted in the tables above, there were no other transfers in or out of Levels I, II, or III during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Transfers into Level III occur as quotations obtained through pricing services are deemed not representative of fair value as of the balance sheet date, and such assets are internally valued. As quotations obtained through pricing services are substantiated through additional market sources, investments are transferred out of Level III. In addition, transfers out of Level III and transfers into Level III occur based on the increase or decrease in the availability of certain observable inputs. Investments will be transferred into Level III from Level II and out of Level III into Level II at fair value as of the beginning of the period in which the reclassification occurred.

Note 5. 
 months commencing on March 1, 2024. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives an annual base management fee and incentive fee from the Company. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the aggregate contributed capital from all unitholders (including any outstanding borrowings under any subscription line drawn in lieu of capital calls) less any return of capital distributions and less any cumulative realized losses since inception (calculated net of any subsequently reversed realized losses and net of any realized gains) as of the last day of the applicable quarter. The base management fee could also be reduced by any voluntary fee waivers made by the Investment Adviser. The management fee will be reduced, but not below , by any amounts paid by the Company or its subsidiaries to a placement agent, any organizational and offering expenses in excess of the lesser of or of the aggregate Capital Commitments and any fund expenses in excess of the Specified Expenses Cap (as defined below). 
 The incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Company's income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Company's capital gains, each as described below. 
 Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 The portion based on the Company's income (the "Income Incentive Fee") is based on pre-incentive fee net investment income ("Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income"). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any fee income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, upfront, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company's operating expenses for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred units, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company's members' capital at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a "hurdle rate" of return of per quarter annualized).

annualized); 
 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to a rate of return of annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the "catch-up." The "catch-up" is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with approximately of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the dollar amount of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter is allocated to the Investment Adviser. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were incentive fees waived. The fees that are payable under the Investment Management Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
 Incentive Fee on Capital Gains 
 The second component of the incentive fee is the capital gains incentive fee. The Company will pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to the Company's cumulative realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation since inception ("Cumulative Net Realized Gains") based on the waterfall below: 
 a. First, no incentive fee is payable to the Investment Adviser on Cumulative Net Realized Gains until total return of capital distributions, distributions of net investment income and distributions of net realized capital gains to unitholders is equal to total capital contributions; 
 b. Second, no incentive fee is payable to the Investment Adviser on Cumulative Net Realized Gains until the Company has paid cumulative distributions equal to an annualized, cumulative internal rate of return of on the total contributed capital to the Company calculated from the date that each such amount was due to be contributed to the Company until the date each such distribution is paid; 
 c. Third, upon a distribution that results in cumulative distributions exceeding the amounts in clause (a) and (b) above, an incentive fee on capital gains payable to the Investment Adviser equal to of the amount of Cumulative Net Realized Gains until the Investment Adviser has received (together with amounts the Investment Adviser has received under Income Incentive Fees) an amount equal to of the sum of (i) the cumulative distributions to unitholders made pursuant to clause (b) above, (ii) Income Incentive Fee paid to the Investment Adviser, and (iii) amounts paid to the Investment Adviser pursuant to this clause (c); and 
 d. Thereafter, an incentive fee on capital gains equal to of additional undistributed Cumulative Net Realized Gains. 
 Upon termination of the Company, the Investment Adviser will be required to return incentive fees to the Company to the extent that: (i) the Investment Adviser has received cumulative incentive fees in excess of of the sum of (A) the Company's cumulative distributions other than return of capital contributions and (B) the cumulative incentive fees paid to the Investment Adviser; or (ii) the unitholders have not received a cumulative internal rate of return; provided that in no event will such restoration be more than the incentive fees received by the Investment Adviser. 
 In accordance with GAAP, the Company accrues a hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net realized capital gains and realized capital losses and the cumulative net unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than the amount in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no such accrual. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year.

Further, if the actual Capital Commitments of the Company at the end of the Closing Period are less than , the prong of the Specified Expenses Cap in clause (1) above will be retroactively adjusted to equal of aggregate committed capital at the end of the Closing Period, and the Investment Adviser has agreed to further reduce and/or waive its management fee for the year in which the Closing Period ends in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the amount that would have been required to be waived/reimbursed pursuant to clause (1) above as adjusted and (B) the amount previously waived/reimbursed pursuant to clause (1) above. "Specified Expenses" of the Company means all Company Expenses (as defined in the Fourth A R LLC Agreement) incurred in the operation of the Company with the exception of: (i) the management fee, (ii) any incentive fees, (iii) Organizational and Offering Expenses (as defined under "Fund Expenses" in the Fourth A R LLC Agreement) (which are subject to the Organizational and Offering Expenses Cap), (iv) Placement Fees (as defined in the Fourth A R LLC Agreement), (v) interest on and fees and expenses arising out of all Company indebtedness and other financing, (vi) costs of any litigation and damages (including the costs of any indemnity or contribution right granted to any placement agent or third-party finder engaged by the Company or its affiliates) and (vii) for the avoidance of doubt, if applicable, any investor level withholding or other taxes. 
 If, while the Investment Adviser is the investment adviser to the Company, the annualized Specified Expenses for a given calendar year are less than the Specified Expenses Cap, the Investment Adviser shall be entitled to reimbursement by the Company of the compensation waived and other expenses borne by the Investment Adviser (the "Reimbursement Amount") on behalf of the Company pursuant to the expense limitation and reimbursement agreement between the Company and the Investment Adviser (the "Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement") during any of the previous , and provided that such amount paid to the Investment Adviser will in no event exceed the total Reimbursement Amount and will not include any amounts previously reimbursed. The Reimbursement Amount plus the annualized Specified Expenses for a given calendar year shall not exceed the Specified Expenses Cap. The Investment Adviser may recapture a Specified Expense in any year within the period after the Investment Adviser bears the expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were no reimbursements to the Investment Adviser pursuant to this provision. 
 The Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties, provided that any amendment that could result in an increase in expenses borne by the Company also must be approved by vote of a majority of the Company's outstanding Units. 
 Less: management fee waiver ) Net management fee Incentive fee, excluding accrued incentive fees on capital gains 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, incentive fee on capital gains was accrued or owed under the Investment Management Agreement by the Company, as Cumulative Net Realized Capital Gains was less than zero. 
 The Company has entered into an administration agreement with the Administrator (as amended and restated, the "Administration Agreement") under which the Administrator provides administrative services. The Administration Agreement was most recently re-approved by the Board on January 30, 2024 for a period of months commencing on March 1, 2024. The Administrator maintains, or oversees the maintenance of, the Company's consolidated financial records, prepares reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), generally monitors the payment of the Company's expenses and oversees the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. The Company reimburses the Administrator for the Company's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations to the Company under the Administration Agreement, including compensation of the Company's chief financial

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately and , respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, none of which were waived by the Administrator. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately and , respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in payable to affiliates. 
 The Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have also entered into a Trademark License Agreement (as amended, the "Trademark License Agreement"), with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the "New Mountain Capital" name. Under the Trademark License Agreement, subject to certain conditions, the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator will have a right to use the "New Mountain Capital" name, for so long as the Investment Adviser or one of its affiliates remains the investment adviser of the Company. Other than with respect to this limited license, the Company, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator will have no legal right to the "New Mountain Capital" name. 
 The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to the Company's investment mandate. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for the Company or for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that the Company should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the "Exemptive Order") to the Investment Adviser and certain of its affiliates, which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits the Company to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, the Company is permitted to co-invest with its affiliates if a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company's directors who are not "interested persons", as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the "Independent Directors"), make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its unitholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its unitholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company's unitholders and is consistent with its then-current investment objective and strategies. 
 In addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs through December 31, 2020 (the "Temporary Relief"), the Company was permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not previously hold an investment in such existing portfolio company. Without the Temporary Relief, such private funds would not be able to participate in such follow-on investments with the Company unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with the Company. Although the Temporary Relief expired on December 31, 2020, the SEC s Division of Investment Management had indicated that until March 31, 2022, it would not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing co-investment order continued to engage in certain transactions described in the Temporary Relief, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. The Temporary Relief is no longer effective; however, on August 30, 2022, New Mountain Finance Corporation, an affiliate of the Company and the Investment Adviser, and certain other affiliated applicants, received an Order from the SEC that amended its existing Exemptive Order to permit the Company to complete follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Unitholders and the Board of Directors of New Mountain Guardian III BDC, L.L.C. 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members capital of New Mountain Guardian III BDC, L.L.C. and subsidiaries (the "Company"), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in members capital for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members capital of the Company, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in members capital and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 6, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of assets, liabilities, and members capital as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members capital from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Overview 
 We are a Delaware limited liability company formed on May 22, 2019. We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 
 The Investment Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. New Mountain Capital is a global investment firm with approximately 55 billion of assets under management and a track record of investing in the middle market. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, credit and net lease investment strategies. The Investment Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment

Table of Contents 

advisory and management services. The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to ours. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the "Administrator"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. 
 We conducted a private offering (the "Private Offering") of units of our limited liability company interests (the "Units") to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Units were offered for subscription continuously throughout the Closing Period (as defined below). Each investor in the Private Offering made a capital commitment (each, a "Capital Commitment") to purchase Units pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us (each, a "Subscription Agreement"). Closings of the Private Offering occurred, from time to time, in the Investment Adviser's sole discretion, during the 18-month period following the initial closing of Capital Commitments, which occurred on July 15, 2019 (the "Closing Period"). Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement, as most recently amended and restated on June 28, 2023 (the "Fourth A R LLC Agreement), the Closing Period was previously extended to and ended on October 15, 2021. We accepted and drew down on Capital Commitments from investors throughout the Closing Period and drew down on Capital Commitments throughout the Investment Period (as defined below). At the end of the Closing Period, we had aggregate Capital Commitments from investors of 1.15 billion. We commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial drawdown from investors in the Private Offering (the "Initial Drawdown"), which occurred on August 2, 2019 (the "Initial Drawdown Date"). The investment period began on July 15, 2019 and ended on July 15, 2023, the four-year anniversary of such date (the "Investment Period"). Our term was initially until July 15, 2025, six years from the beginning of the Investment Period, subject to (i) a one year extension as determined by the Investment Adviser in its sole discretion and (ii) an additional one year extension as determined by our board of directors (the six year period together with any successive extensions, the "Term"). Pursuant to the Fourth A R LLC Agreement, the Investment Adviser extended our Term for an additional one-year period, to July 15, 2026. 
 We established New Mountain Guardian III SPV, L.L.C. ("GIII SPV") as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary whose assets are used to secure GIII SPV's credit facility. We established New Mountain Guardian III OEC, Inc. ("GIII OEC") as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary, which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is intended to facilitate our compliance with the requirements to be treated as a RIC under the Code by holding equity or equity-like investments in one of our portfolio companies organized as a limited liability company (or other form of pass through entities). We consolidate GIII OEC for accounting purposes but it is not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may incur U.S. federal income tax expense as a result of its ownership of the portfolio company. 
 We focus on providing direct lending solutions to U.S. upper middle market companies backed by top private equity sponsors. Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of senior secured loans and select junior capital positions, to growing businesses in defensive industries that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our differentiated investment approach leverages the deep sector knowledge and operating resources of New Mountain Capital. 
 We primarily invest in senior secured debt of U.S. sponsor-backed, middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of 10.0 million to 200.0 million. Our focus is on defensive growth businesses that generally exhibit the following characteristics: (i) acyclicality, (ii) sustainable secular growth drivers, (iii) niche market dominance and high barriers to competitive entry, (iv) recurring revenue and strong free cash flow, (v) flexible cost structures and (vi) seasoned management teams. 
 Senior secured loans may include traditional first lien loans or unitranche loans. We invest a significant portion of our portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt. Certain unitranche loan investments may include last-out positions, which generally heighten the risk of loss. In some cases, our investments may also include equity interests. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our top five industry concentrations were software, healthcare, business services, consumer services and distribution logistics. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our members' capital was approximately 857.9 million and our portfolio had a fair value of approximately 1,538.7 million in 73 portfolio companies.

 The Merger 
 In the Merger, each of the Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the Determination Date (other than the Units owned by NEWCRED or any of its consolidated subsidiaries (the Cancelled Units )) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Company Per Unit NAV (as defined below) (the Merger Consideration ). 
 Under the Merger Agreement, on a date which is no earlier than forty-eight (48) hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) prior to the Effective Time, the Company will deliver to NEWCRED a calculation of its estimated NAV, calculated in good faith as of the Determination Date and based on the same assumptions and methodologies, and applying the same categories of adjustments to NAV, historically used by the Company in preparing the calculation of the NAV per Unit (with an accrual for any dividend declared by the Company and not yet paid) (the Closing NAV ).

On October 31, 2024, the Company received the requisite approval from its unitholders to approve the Merger. 
 The Amendment of the Fourth A R LLC Agreement 
 The Company agreed to amend the Fourth A R LLC Agreement (the Fifth A R LLC Agreement ), subsequent to obtaining the requisite approval of the Company s unitholders, which occurred on October 31, 2024. Pursuant to the Fourth A R LLC Agreement, the Company s Investment Period ended on July 15, 2023, which is the four-year anniversary of the date the Company first accepted capital commitments from unitholders. The Fifth A R LLC Agreement, among other things, extends the Investment Period until August 31, 2025 for purposes of allowing the Company to retain and use the realized proceeds from the sale or repayment of its investments for making additional investments and paying Company expenses as set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the Fifth A R LLC Agreement (such extended period, the Reinvestment Investment Period and allows the Company to enter into financing facilities to obtain leverage for purposes of making additional investments with such realized proceeds during the Reinvestment Investment Period. All other references to the Investment Period in the Fifth A R LLC Agreement remain unchanged. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting estimates. 
 Basis of Accounting 
 We consolidate our wholly-owned direct subsidiaries GIII SPV and GIII OEC. We are an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies ("ASC 946"). 
 Valuation and Leveling of Portfolio Investments 
 At all times, consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of our assets, which impacts our members' capital. 
 62 

Table of Contents 

We value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Our quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below: 
 (1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. 
 (2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. 
 a. Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and, if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and 
 b. For investments other than bonds, we look at the number of quotes readily available and perform the following procedures: 
 i. Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. We will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, we will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value; and 
 ii. Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). 
 (3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: 
 a. Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring; 
 b. Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management; 
 c. If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; and 
 d. When deemed appropriate by our management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided. 
 For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of a commitment not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded. 
 The values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material. 
 GAAP fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows: 
 Level I Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and we have the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include 
 63 

Table of Contents 

active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), we, to the extent that we hold such investments, do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. 
 Level II Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following: 
 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently); 
 Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and 
 Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 Level III Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. 
 The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs. 
 The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Valu e in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024.

We generally use the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there is little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. We typically determine the fair value of our performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered: 
 Company Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of our due diligence process, we evaluate the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, we analyze each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and EBITDA growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. We also attempt to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of our original investment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. We leverage the knowledge gained from our original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine our outlook for each of our portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of our investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation. 
 For debt investments, we may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of our debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, we may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value. After enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for our debt investments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment. 
 Market Based Approach: We may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing EBITDA or revenue multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. We consider numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value our portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, and relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. We may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA or revenue multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month ("LTM") EBITDA or revenue or projected EBITDA or revenue to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA or revenue multiples will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. 
 Income Based Approach: We also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a combination of a yield calibration approach and a comparable investment approach. The yield calibration approach incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. The comparable investment approach utilizes and average yield-to-maturity of a selected set of high-quality, liquid investments to determine a comparable investment discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Fair Value in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our Level III investments as of September 30, 2024. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Sales and paydowns of investments: Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on the specific identification method. 
 Interest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. We have loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal balance on the capitalization date and are generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized PIK interest from investments of approximately 3.5 million and 11.3 million, respectively, and PIK dividends from investments of approximately 2.2 million and 7.3 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended 
 65 

Table of Contents 

September 30, 2023, we recognized PIK interest from investments of approximately 3.0 million and 8.4 million, respectively, and PIK dividends from investments of approximately 2.5 million and 7.2 million, respectively. 
 Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible. 
 Non-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due for 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate collectability. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no investments were on non-accrual status. 
 Fee income: Fee income represents delayed compensation, amendment fees, revolver fees and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after the trade date. Fee income may also include fees from bridge loans. We may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received by us for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment, and are non-refundable. 
 
 Monitoring of Portfolio Investments 
 We monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy. Our portfolio monitoring procedures are designed to provide a simple yet comprehensive analysis of our portfolio companies based on their operating performance and underlying business characteristics, which in turn forms the basis of its Risk Rating (as defined below). 
 We use an investment risk rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. As such, we assign each investment a composite score ("Risk Rating") based on two metrics 1) Operating Performance and 2) Business Characteristics: 
 Operating Performance assesses the health of the investment in context of its financial performance and the market environment it faces. The metric is expressed in Tiers of 4 to 1 , with 4 being the best and 1 being the worst: 
 Tier 4 Business performance is in-line with or above expectations 
 Tier 3 Moderate business underperformance and/or moderate market headwinds 
 Tier 2 Significant business underperformance and/or significant market headwinds 
 Tier 1 Severe business underperformance and/or severe market headwinds 
 Business Characteristics assesses the health of the investment in context of the underlying portfolio company s business and credit quality, the underlying portfolio company s current balance sheet, and the level of support from the equity sponsor. The metric is expressed as on a qualitative scale of A to C , with A being the best and C being the worst. 
 The Risk Rating for each investment is a composite of these two metrics. The Risk Rating is expressed in categories of Green, Yellow, Orange and Red, with Green reflecting an investment that is in-line with or above expectations and Red reflecting an investment performing materially below expectations. The mapping of the composite scores to these categories are below: 
 Green 4C, 3B, 2A, 4B, 3A, and 4A (e.g., Tier 4 for Operating Performance and C for Business Characteristics) 
 Yellow 3C, 2B, and 1A 
 Orange 2C and 1B 
 Red 1C

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Three Months Ended (in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Total interest income 45,460 61,466 Dividend income 2,231 2,482 Fee income 216 510 Total investment income 47,907 64,458 
 Our total investment income decreased by approximately 16.6 million, or 26 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income of approximately 47.9 million consisted of approximately 41.3 million in cash interest from investments, approximately 3.5 million in PIK and non-cash interest from investments, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately 0.7 million, approximately 2.2 million in PIK dividends from investments and approximately 0.2 million in fee income. 
 The decrease in interest income of approximately 16.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to lower invested balances as a result of repayments received on our investments during the period as our Investment Period ended on July 15, 2023. Dividend income was relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fee income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to unfunded fees received, amendment fees received from two different portfolio companies and consent fee received from one portfolio company.

 Our total net operating expenses decreased by approximately 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our incentive fee decreased by approximately 2.4 million and our net management fee decreased by approximately 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower invested capital balances as a result of repayments received on investments and the corresponding return of capital distributions made during the period. 
 Interest and other financing expenses decreased by approximately 3.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower average debt outstanding during the period and decreased SOFR rates on our floating rate borrowings on the GS Credit Facility. 
 Our total professional fees increased by approximately 1.5 million and our other general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to expenses related to the Merger. Our administrative expenses decreased by approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower invested capital balances as a result of repayments received on investments. Income tax benefit decreased by approximately 1.4 million due to an estimated refund for income taxes paid on income allocated to

 Our net realized gains and unrealized depreciation resulted in a net loss of approximately 9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net realized losses and unrealized appreciation resulting in a net gain of approximately 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations, we look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the overall decrease in market prices of our investments during the period and accelerated amortization recognized on 4 of our investments due to early repayments made. The net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the overall increase in market prices of our investments during the period. The benefit for income taxes was attributable to the equity investment held during the three months ended September 30, 2023 in GIII OEC.

As movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations, we look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the realized losses on three positions. The provision for income taxes was attributable to the income earned on the equity investment held during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in GIII OEC. The net gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the overall increase in fair value of our investments during the period, partially offset by realized losses on four positions. The provision for income taxes was attributable to the equity investment held as of September 30, 2023 in GIII OEC.

Liquidity, Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Borrowings and Contractual Obligations 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our unitholders or for other general corporate purposes. 
 We expect to generate cash from (1) cash flows from investments and operations and (2) borrowings from banks or other lenders. We will seek to enter into any bank debt, credit facility or other financing arrangements on at least customary market terms, however, we cannot assure you we will be able to do so. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. Upon organization, the Investment Adviser, as our initial unitholder, authorized us to adopt the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which resulted in the reduction of the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to us from 200.0 to 150.0 . In connection with their subscriptions for our Units, our unitholders were required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150.0 . In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 150.0 after such borrowing (which means we can borrow 2 for every 1 of our equity). As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 221.3 . 
 Since our inception on May 22, 2019, we have entered into Subscription Agreements with several investors on various dates. Closings of the Private Offering occurred, from time to time, in the Investment Adviser's sole discretion, during the Closing Period, which ended on October 15, 2021. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had aggregate capital commitments and undrawn capital commitments from investors as follows: 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Capital Commitments 1,149.1 1,149.1 Unfunded Capital Commitments of Capital Commitments funded 100.0 100.0 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our borrowings consisted of the Unsecured Notes and the GS Credit Facility. See Item 1 Financial Statements Note 6. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 41.0 million and 69.9 million, respectively. Our cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was approximately 527.3 million and 107.1 million, respectively. We expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from operations and borrowings from banks or other lenders. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to third parties to fund investments totaling 83.9 million and 119.3 million, respectively, under various undrawn revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments. 
 We may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters or bridge financing commitments, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no commitment letters to purchase investments, which could require funding in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments which could require funding in the future.

 (2) Under the terms of the GS Credi t Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility 507.3 million as of September 30, 2024) must be repaid on or before (a) May 28, 2028, or (b) 45 days prior to the expiration of our Term. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 159.8 million capacity, subject to borrowing base limitations, remaining under the GS Credit Facility. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 6. Borrowings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for material details on the GS Credit Facility. 
 We have entered into an investment advisory and management agreement (the "Investment Management Agreement") with the Investment Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser has agreed to provide us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay for these services (1) a management fee and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance. 
 We have also entered into an administration agreement (the "Administration Agreement") with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to arrange office space for us and provide office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and other administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations. The Administrator has also agreed to maintain, or oversee the maintenance of, our financial records, our reports to unitholders and reports filed with the SEC. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. 
 If any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that are entered into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement. 
 
 Distributions and Dividends 
 Distributions declared to unitholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 331.0 million. 
 Tax characteristics of all distributions paid are reported to unitholders on Form 1099 or Form 1042 after the end of the calendar year. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, total distributions declared were 138.3 million and 102.3 million, respectively, of which the distributions were comprised of approximately 100.00 and 100.00 , respectively, of ordinary income, 0.00 and 0.00 , respectively, of long-term capital gains and 0.00 and 0.00 , respectively of a return of capital. Future quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by our board of directors. 
 We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders in amounts sufficient to qualify as and maintain our status as a RIC. We intend to distribute approximately all of our net investment income on a quarterly basis and substantially all of our taxable income on an annual basis, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment. 
 
 Related Parties 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. Therefore, New Mountain Capital is entitled to any profits earned by the Investment Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Management Agreement. 
 We have entered into the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement with the Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser has agreed to reduce and/or waive its management fee (the "Specified Expenses Cap") each

year such that we will not be required to pay certain expenses in excess of a maximum aggregate amount defined in the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement. 
 We have entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. The Administrator arranges our office space and provides office equipment and administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Administrator has hired a third-party sub-administrator to assist with the provision of administrative services. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations to us under the Administration Agreement, which includes the fees and expenses associated with performing administrative, finance, and compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement and further restricted by us, the Administrator may, in its own discretion, submit to us for reimbursement some or all of the expenses that the Administrator has incurred on our behalf during any quarterly period. As a result, the amount of expenses for which we will have to reimburse the Administrator may fluctuate in future quarterly periods and there can be no assurance given as to when, or if, the Administrator may determine to limit the expenses that the Administrator submits to us for reimbursement in the future. The Administrator cannot recoup any expenses that the Administrator has previously waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 0.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively, of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, none of which were waived by the Administrator. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 0.2 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in payable to affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. 
 We, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have entered into a royalty-free Trademark License Agreement with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant us, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "New Mountain Capital". 
 In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors. These officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by the 1940 Act and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. 
 The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to our investment mandates. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the "Exemptive Order") to the Investment Adviser and certain of its affiliates, which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits us to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our unitholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our unitholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our unitholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. The Exemptive Order was amended on August 30, 2022 to permit us to complete follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to certain financial market risks, such as interest rate fluctuations. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Federal Reserve was periodically raising interest rates to combat inflation and maintained the same rate benchmark from July 2023 to September 2024. While the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 for the first time since March 2020, future reductions to benchmark rates are not certain. In a high interest rate environment, our net investment income would increase due to an increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. However, our cost of funds would also increase, which could also impact net investment income. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result in a recession in the United States, which would likely decrease interest rates. Alternatively, in a prolonged low interest rate environment, including a reduction of base rates, such as SOFR, to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain of the loans held in our portfolio had floating Prime or SOFR interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 94.7 of our investments at fair value (excluding unfunded debt investments and non-interest bearing equity investments) represent floating-rate investments with a SOFR floor (includes investments bearing prime interest rate contracts) and approximately 5.3 of investments at fair value represent fixed-rate investments. Additionally, our senior secured revolving credit facility is also subject to floating interest rates and is currently paid based on floating SOFR interest rates. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense, should interest rates increase by 200, 150, 100 or 50 basis points, or decrease by 50, 100, 150, or 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our outstanding credit facility and Unsecured Notes. For our borrowings, we use the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. This analysis does not take into account the impact of the incentive fee or other expenses. The base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain unchanged from the actual effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. 
 Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table. 
 Change in Interest Rates Estimated Percentage Change in Interest Income Net of Interest Expense (unaudited) -200 Basis Points (14.98) -150 Basis Points (11.24) -100 Basis Points (7.49) -50 Basis Points (3.75) +50 Basis Points 3.75 +100 Basis Points 7.49 +150 Basis Points 11.24 +200 Basis Points 14.98

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 The terms "we", "us", "our" and the "Company" refers to New Mountain Guardian III BDC, L.L.C. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We, and our consolidated subsidiaries, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings as of September 30, 2024. From time to time, we or our consolidated subsidiary may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, and as set forth below, Unitholders should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results, including the Risk Factor titled "Fund-Level Borrowings". In addition, Unitholders should carefully consider the general risks of the Company described below with respect to the Agreement and Plan of Merger with New Mountain Private Credit Fund. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the risks set forth below, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER 
 
 Because the Company Per Unit NAV may fluctuate, Unitholders cannot be sure of the exact amount of the Merger Consideration they will receive until the Closing Date. 
 The exact amount of Merger Consideration may vary from the Company Per Unit NAV on the date the Merger was announced, on the date that this Consent Solicitation Statement was made available to Unitholders and on the date that the Merger is completed. Any change in the Company Per Unit NAV prior to completion of the Merger will affect the amount of Merger Consideration that Unitholders will receive upon completion of the Merger. Changes in the Company Per Unit NAV may result from a variety of factors, including, among other things: 
 changes in the business, operations or prospects of the Company; 
 the financial condition of current or prospective portfolio companies of the Company; and 
 interest rates or general market or economic conditions. 
 These factors are generally beyond the control of the Company. The range of high and low Company Per Unit NAV for the period between January 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024 was a low of 8.00 to a high of 9.65. However, historical prices are not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 The announcement and pendency of the Merger Agreement could negatively affect the Company Per Unit NAV and the Merger Consideration that Unitholders will receive. 
 Whether or not the Merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in the business of the Company that otherwise may not occur if the Company did not participate in the Merger. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of a failure to obtain the Unitholder Approval or the failure of New Mountain Private Credit Fund ("NEWCRED") to hold sufficient cash to pay the Merger Consideration or the fees and expenses expected to be borne by NEWCRED in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected. As a result, the Company may experience negative impacts on the Company Per Unit NAV, which, if the Merger is completed, may impact the Merger Consideration that Unitholders receive. 
 If the Merger closes, the Merger Consideration that Unitholders receive may be less than the value that Unitholders would receive if they held their Company Units until the end of the term of the Company. 
 If the Merger closes, each Company Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for the Cancelled Units) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Company Per Unit NAV. Due to potential changes in the Company Per Unit NAV, as discussed in this section, Unitholders may receive a cash value for each Company Unit that may be less than the value of such Company Units if such Unitholders were to hold the Company Units until the end of the term of the Company (i.e., July 15, 2026, or as may be otherwise extended by the Board).

Table of Contents 

If the Merger does not close, the Company will not benefit from the expenses incurred in its pursuit of the Merger. 
 The Merger may not be completed. If the Merger is not completed, the Company may have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. In particular, the Company may have incurred out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Merger for legal and accounting fees and financial printing and other related charges, much of which will be incurred even if the Merger is not completed. Further, all expenses incurred in connection with the Merger will be paid by the Company, such that, if the Merger is not completed, the Company will bear the burden of the expenses incurred for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. 
 Litigation that may be filed against NEWCRED or the Company in connection with the Merger, regardless of its merits, could result in substantial costs and could delay or prevent the Merger from being completed. 
 From time to time, NEWCRED or the Company may be subject to legal actions, including securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits, as well as various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas in connection with the Merger. These or any similar securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits, regardless of their merits, may result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment in such cases could have a negative impact on the Company s liquidity and financial condition or could prevent the Merger from being completed. 
 The termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company. 
 If the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences, including: 
 the Company s business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger; 
 the Company may not be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the price NEWCRED agreed to pay in the Merger; and 
 due to potential changes in the Company Per Unit NAV, as discussed in this section, if Unitholders were to hold the Company Units until the end of the term of the Company (i.e., July 15, 2026, or as may be otherwise extended by the Board), Unitholders may receive a cash value for each Company Unit that may be less than the value of such Company Units if the Merger is consummated and the Unitholders receive the Merger Consideration. 
 The Merger is subject to closing conditions, including the receipt of the Unitholder Approval and NEWCRED s ability to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and all fees and expenses expected to be borne by NEWCRED in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the Merger not being completed, which may result in material adverse consequences to the Company s business and operations. 
 The Merger is subject to closing conditions, including the Unitholder Approval and NEWCRED s ability to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and all fees and expenses expected to be borne by NEWCRED in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, that, if not satisfied, will prevent the Merger from being completed. If a closing condition is not satisfied and the Merger is not completed, the resulting failure of the Merger could have a material adverse impact on the Company s business and operations. The Merger is subject to the condition that any consents, approvals, confirmations and authorizations required to consummate the Transactions (including the Merger) pursuant to the terms of the GS Credit Facility have been obtained. If such consents, approvals, confirmations or authorizations have not been obtained, the Merger may not be completed. The Merger is also subject to the condition that, at the time of the Closing, NEWCRED has sufficient cash to pay the Merger Consideration and fees and expenses associated with the Merger. If NEWCRED does not hold sufficient cash, the Merger may not be completed. In addition, the Merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond the control of NEWCRED and the Company that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the Merger. The Company cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. 
 The Company may, to the extent legally allowed, waive one or more conditions to the Merger without resoliciting Unitholder Approval. 
 Certain conditions to NEWCRED s and the Company s respective obligations to complete the Merger may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally allowed, either unilaterally or by mutual agreement. In the event that any such waiver does not require resolicitation of Unitholders, NEWCRED and the Company will have the discretion to complete the Merger without seeking further Unitholder Approval. Accordingly, the terms and conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement and described herein, including certain protections to NEWCRED and the Company, may be waived. The condition requiring the approval of the Merger Proposal, however, cannot be waived. 
 The Company will be subject to operational uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, including restrictions on pursuing alternatives to the Merger. 
 77 

Table of Contents 

Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger may have an adverse effect on the Company and, consequently, on the combined company following the completion of the Merger. These uncertainties may impair the Investment Adviser s ability to motivate key personnel until the Merger is consummated and could cause those who deal with the Company to seek to change their existing business relationships with the Company. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts the Company from taking actions that the Company might otherwise consider to be in its best interest. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger, including alternatives to the Merger. 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage or make it difficult for a third party to acquire the Company prior to the completion of the proposed Merger. 
 The Merger Agreement prohibits the Company from soliciting alternatives to the Merger and imposes limitations on the Company s ability to respond to and negotiate unsolicited proposals received from third parties. The Merger Agreement contains customary non-solicitation and other provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, limit the Company s ability to discuss, facilitate or commit to competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of the Company. The Company can consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to an alternative proposal only in limited circumstances so long as certain notice and other procedural requirements are satisfied. 
 If the Merger and Rollover Transaction do not together qualify as a tax-deferred reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, Unitholders participating in the Rollover Transaction may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes. 
 While the Company and NEWCRED intend to take the position for U.S. federal income tax purposes that the Merger, together with the Rollover Transaction, constitutes a tax-deferred reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Code, this position is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the position of the Company and NEWCRED. If the Merger and Rollover Transaction, together, are not treated as a tax-deferred reorganization, U.S. Unitholders, as defined below, of the Company participating in the Rollover Transaction would be considered to have made a taxable sale of their Company Units to NEWCRED, and such U.S. Unitholders of the Company would generally recognize taxable gain or loss on their receipt of NEWCRED Shares in the Rollover Transaction. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None, other than those already disclosed in certain current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 (a) None. 
 
 (b) None. 
 
 (c) For the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, no director or officer has or (i) any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of securities intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act or (ii) any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. 
 
 We have adopted insider trading policies and procedures governing the purchase, sale, and disposition of our 
 securities by our officers and directors that are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, 
 rules and regulations.
