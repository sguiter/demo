the standard on , and plans to adopt the standard for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of its adoption of ASU 2023-07 on the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements but does anticipate that such an adoption will have a material impact. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, under which an entity that qualifies as either a joint venture or a corporate joint venture is required to apply a new basis of accounting upon the formation of the joint venture. Specifically, the ASU provides that a joint venture or a corporate joint venture must initially measure its assets and liabilities at fair value on the formation date. The amendments in ASU 2023-05 are effective for all joint ventures within the ASU s scope that are formed on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.

 year and years, and in some instances include one or more options to renew. The Company includes options to extend the lease term if the options are reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company currently considers some of its renewal options to be reasonably certain to be exercised. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. The Company does not have material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants associated with its leases. Finance and operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and finance and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company calculates the present value of its finance and operating leases using an estimated incremental borrowing rate IBR ), which requires judgment. For real estate operating leases, the Company estimates the IBR based on prevailing market rates for collateralized debt in a similar economic environment with similar payment terms and maturity dates commensurate with the terms of the lease. For all other leases, the Company estimates the IBR based on the stated interest rate on the contract. Since many of the inputs used to calculate the rate implicit in the leases are not readily determinable from the lessee s perspective, the Company does not use the implicit interest rate. Certain leases contain variable payments, these payments are expensed as incurred and not included in the Company s operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and operating lease liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments for maintenance, utilities, taxes, and insurance and are excluded from the present value of the Company s lease obligations. The Company does not record operating lease ROU assets or operating lease liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. The Company also combines lease and non-lease components on all new or modified operating leases into a single lease component for all classes of assets.

Income tax expense recorded by the Company during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The difference between the ETR and federal statutory rate of is primarily attributable to items recorded for U.S. GAAP but permanently disallowed for U.S. federal income tax purposes, recognition of a U.S. federal and state valuation allowance and state and foreign income tax provisions. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more-likely-than-not some of the Company s deferred tax assets may not be realized. Significant judgment is applied when assessing the need for a valuation allowance and the Company considers future taxable income, reversals of existing deferred tax assets and liabilities and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, in making such assessment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s U.S. federal, state and various foreign net deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not to be realized and a full valuation allowance is maintained. The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, on the basis of a two-step process in which (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of such position and (ii) for those tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50.0 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company has determined it has uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 . The Company classifies interest and penalties recognized on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.

The Company paid dividends on shares of the Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock of million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock terms include the following: (i) no mandatory redemption, (ii) no stated value cash repayment obligation other than in the event of certain defined liquidation events, (iii) only redeemable at the Company s option, (iv) convertible into common stock beginning in April 2024 at a discount to the common stock market price (with a limit of million in stated value of Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock eligible to be converted in any 60-day period prior to the seventh anniversary of issuance and the amount of stated value of the Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock eligible for conversion limited to million during year 5 and million (which includes the aggregate amount of the stated value of the Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock and any accrued but unpaid dividends added to such stated value of any shares of Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock converted in year 5) during year 6), (v) dividend rate per year with required quarterly cash payments, (vi) in an event of noncompliance, the dividend rate shall increase to per annum for the first period from and including the date the noncompliance event occurred, and thereafter shall increase to per annum, (vii) debt incurrence test ratio of times, and (viii) minimum repayment amount of million. million in aggregate stated value of the Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock and (ii) all of the Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock then outstanding) of the outstanding Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock in cash. In January 2024, the Company redeemed million of the outstanding Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock with cash. As of September 30, 2024 , the aggregate amount of the Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding was million, or shares. The Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock does not meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480- Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. However, as (i) the instrument is redeemable upon a change of control as defined in the certificate of designations governing the terms of the Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock, and (ii) the Company cannot assert it would have sufficient authorized and unissued shares of common stock to settle all future conversion requests due to the variable conversion terms, the instrument is redeemable upon the occurrence of events that are not solely within the control of the Company, and therefore the Company classifies the Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock as mezzanine equity. Subsequent adjustment of the carrying value of the instrument is required if the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has determined that a change of control is not probable. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has determined that it is not probable that there will be a future conversion request that the Company is unable to settle with authorized and issued shares based on the Company s current stock price and available shares as well as the Company s monitoring efforts to ensure there are a sufficient number of shares available to settle any conversion request. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has determined that the instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable, and does not believe subsequent adjustment of the carrying value of the instrument will be necessary. The Convertible and Redeemable Series A-2 Preferred Stock contains a conversion option of the preferred stock to shares of common stock beginning on the fourth-year anniversary of the issuance date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this conversion embedded feature had a net fair value of million and million, respectively. The change in net fair value of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, was recorded to other expense.

operating and reportable segments: Assessment, Permitting and Response, Measurement and Analysis and Remediation and Reuse. These segments are monitored separately by management for performance against budget and prior year and are consistent with internal financial reporting. The Company s operating segments are organized based upon primary services provided, the nature of the production process, types of customers, methods used to distribute the products and the nature of the regulatory environment. Our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), reviews Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of operating performance for all operating segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the calculated Co mpany s Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA ), adjusted to exclude certain transactions such as stock-based compensation, acquisition costs and fair value changes in financial instruments, amongst others. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the calculation of Segment adjusted EBITDA no longer adjusts for start-up losses and investment in new services as the CODM no longer reviews the Segment Adjusted EBITDA measure without these costs. The CODM does not review segment assets as a measure of segment performance. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company determined to discontinue one of its non-core specialty service lines within the lab testing business (the "Discontinued Specialty Lab"). On December 29, 2023, the Company sold the assets of the Discontinued Specialty Lab for a total sales price of million, of which million was received in cash and million was issued as a promissory note receivable. The promissory note receivable is subject to an annual interest rate and will be repaid in 60 monthly installments with the remaining balance payable in full on December 29, 2028. The promissory note receivable balance, net of expected loss and payment, was million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The discontinuation of this specialty service line, which was part of the Company's Measurement and Analysis segment, did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results, therefore it did not meet the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results or outcomes may vary in material respects from what we may have expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement and, therefore, you 
 27 

should not regard any forward-looking statement as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will successfully achieve the expectation, plan or objective expressed in such forward-looking statement in any specified time frame, or at all. We caution that you should not place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which we make it. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities laws.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes and other information included elsewhere in this filing and our other filings with the SEC, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements , and elsewhere in this filing and our other filings with the SEC, including in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Overview 
 Since our inception in 2012, our mission has been to help clients and communities meet their environmental goals and needs. According to data derived from a 2023 Environmental Industry Study prepared by Environmental Business International, Inc., or EBI, which we commissioned, the global environmental industry is estimated to be approximately 1.44 trillion, with 494.0 billion concentrated in the United States. 
 Our Segments 
 We provide environmental services to our clients through three business segments Assessment, Permitting and Response, Measurement and Analysis and Remediation and Reuse. For more information on each of our operating segments, see Item 1. Business in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Assessment, Permitting and Response 
 Assessment, Permitting and Response segment provides scientific advisory and consulting services to support environmental assessments, environmental emergency response and recovery, toxicology consulting and environmental audits and permits for current operations, facility upgrades, new projects, decommissioning projects and development projects. We work closely with clients to navigate the regulatory process at the local, state, provincial and federal levels, identify the potential environmental and political impacts of their decisions and develop practical mitigation approaches, as needed. In addition to environmental toxicology, and given our expertise in helping businesses plan for and respond to disruptions, our scientists and response teams have helped clients navigate their preparation for and response to emergency response situations. 
 Measurement and Analysis 
 Measurement and Analysis segment is one of the largest providers of environmental testing and laboratory services in North America. Our highly credentialed teams test and analyze air, water and soil to determine concentrations of contaminants, as well as the toxicological impact of contaminants on flora, fauna and human health. Our offerings include source and ambient air testing and monitoring, leak detection, and advanced multi-media laboratory services, including air, soil, stormwater, wastewater and drinking water analysis. 
 Remediation and Reuse 
 Remediation and Reuse segment provides clients with engineering, design, and implementation services, primarily (i) treatment technologies which treat contaminated water or create biogas from waste, or (ii) soil remediation. Our employees, including engineers, scientists and consultants, provide these services to assist our clients in designing solutions, managing products and mitigating environmental risks and liabilities at their locations. We do not own the properties or facilities at which we implement these projects or the underlying liabilities, nor do we own material amounts of the equipment used in projects. 
 
 These operating segments have been structured and organized to align with how we view and manage the business with the full lifecycle of our clients targeted environmental concerns and needs in mind. Within each segment, we cover similar service offerings, regulatory frameworks, internal operating structures and client types. Corporate activities not directly related to segment performance, including general corporate expenses, interest and taxes, are reported separately. 
 Key Factors that Affect Our Business and Our Results 
 Our operating results and financial performance are influenced by a variety of internal and external trends and other factors. Some of the more important factors are discussed briefly below. 
 29 

Acquisitions 
 We have been, and expect to continue to be, an acquisitive company. Acquisitions have expanded our environmental service capabilities across all three segments, our access to technology, as well as our geographic reach in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. The table below sets forth the number of acquisitions completed, revenues generated by and the percentage of total revenues attributable to those acquisitions completed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

_________________________________ 
 (1) Acquisitions revenue amounts in Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements includes third quarter revenue from acquisitions completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 15.0 million and 29.2 million, respectively, whereas this disclosure includes third quarter revenue only attributable to acquisitions acquired during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Revenues from acquired companies exclude intercompany revenues from revenue synergies realized between business lines within operating segments, as these are eliminated at the consolidated segment and Company level. We expect our revenue growth to continue to be driven in significant part by acquisitions. See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant proportion of our total assets, and amortization of intangible assets has historically been a significant expense. Our historical financial statements also include other acquisition-related costs, including costs relating to external legal support, diligence and valuation services and other transaction and integration-related matters. In addition, in any year gains and losses from changes in the fair value of business acquisition contingencies such as earn-outs could be significant. The amount of each for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was as follows:

We expect that amortization of identifiable intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, assuming we continue to acquire, will continue to be significant. 
 Additionally, we made earn-out payments of 1.5 million in March 2024 in connection with our acquisition of Huco Consulting, Inc. ("Huco"), of which, 0.4 million was paid in cash, and the remaining 1.1 million in the Company's common stock. In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we may make up to 58.6 million in aggregate earn-out payments between the years 2024 and 2026, of which up to 23.4 million may be paid only in cash, up to 13.1 million may be paid only in common stock and up to 22.1 million may be paid, at our option, in cash or common stock. See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 Organic Growth 
 
 We define organic growth as the change in revenues excluding revenues from (i) our environmental emergency response business, (ii) acquisitions for the first twelve months following the date of acquisition, and (iii) businesses held for sale, disposed of or discontinued. Management uses organic growth as one of the means by which it assesses our results of operations. Organic growth is not, however, a measure of revenue growth calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and should be considered in conjunction with revenue growth calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have grown organically over the long term and expect to continue to do so. 
 Discontinued Service Lines and Contracts 
 Periodically, or when circumstances warrant, we evaluate the performance of our business services to ensure that performance and outlook are consistent with expectations, and that the services offered are consistent with the Company s mission. 
 
 30 

As part of this evaluation, during the first quarter of 2023, we determined to sell one of our specialty lab testing businesses, the Discontinued Specialty Lab, whose service offering was non-core to the Company s business. On December 29, 2023, we sold the assets of the Discontinued Specialty Lab for a total sales price of 4.8 million. The discontinuation of this specialty service line did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results, therefore it did not meet the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations. 
 Revenue Mix 
 Our segments and our business lines within each segment generate different levels of profitability and, accordingly, shifts in the mix of revenues between segments can impact our consolidated reported net income, net loss margin, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin from quarter to quarter and year to year. Inter-company revenues between business lines within segments have been eliminated. See Note 19 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 Financial Statements. 
 Our revenues and certain expenses, including selling, general and administrative expense, vary from period to period due primary to changes in organic growth, the incremental contribution from recent acquisitions and strategic decisions we may make from time to time. When we refer to changes driven by organic growth, we are referring to the contribution from businesses that have been part of Montrose for more than 12 months, with certain limited exclusions as discussed in greater detail above. In a given reporting period, when we refer to revenue changes driven by acquisitions, we are referring to the revenue contribution from any acquisition from its closing date through the first 12 months of that acquisition, at which point any subsequent contribution therefrom would be organic. 
 Financing Costs 
 Total debt at September 30, 2024 was 249.8 million net of deferred debt issuance costs, which was an increase of 86.6 million compared to December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily driven by the additional 50.0 million term loan and additional usage of our revolving line of credit, partially offset by repayments and amortization of the various debt noted. 
 Interest expense, net was 4.1 million and 11.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 2.1 million and 5.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We expect interest expense to remain a significant cost as we continue to leverage our credit facility to support our operations and future acquisitions. 
 See Note 12 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Corporate and Operational Infrastructure Investments 
 Our historical operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing investments in our corporate infrastructure to support our growth. We have made and expect to continue to make investments in our business platform that we believe have laid the foundation for continued growth. Investments in logistics, quality, risk management, sales and marketing, safety, human resources, research and development, finance and information technology and other areas enable us to support continued growth. These investments should allow us to improve our margins over time. 
 Seasonality 
 Due to the field-based nature of certain of our services, weather patterns generally impact our field-based teams ability to operate in the winter months. As a result, our operating results could experience some quarterly variability with generally lower revenues and lower earnings in the first and fourth quarters and higher overall revenues and earnings in the second and third quarters. As we continue to grow and expand into new geographies and service lines, quarterly variability in our Measurement and Analysis and Remediation and Reuse segments may deviate from historical trends. 
 Earnings Volatility 
 In addition to the impact of seasonality on earnings, our emergency response business exposes us to potentially significant revenue and earnings fluctuations tied both to the timing of large environmental emergency response projects following an incident or natural disaster or more broad scale events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We also saw significant emergency response revenue in 2023 from a single event. Demand for environmental emergency response services remains difficult to predict and as a result, we may have experienced revenues and earnings in prior years that are not indicative of future results, making those periods particularly difficult comparisons for future periods. Earnings volatility is also driven by the timing of large projects, particularly in our Remediation and Reuse segment, and the impact of acquisitions. As a result of these factors, and because demand for environmental services is not driven by specific or predictable patterns in one or more fiscal quarters, our business is better assessed based on yearly results.

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10.8 million or 6.4 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, which contributed 15.4 million to the increase in revenues, and strong organic growth driven primarily by our Assessment, Permitting and Response and Measurement and Analysis segments. These increases were partially offset by 12.8 million lower environmental emergency response service revenues, lower treatment technology revenue within our Remediation and Reuse segment, and prior year revenues from the Discontinued Specialty Lab of 2.0 million, which was sold in December 2023. 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 48.9 million or 10.7 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, which contributed 63.6 million to the increase in revenues, and strong organic growth driven by our Assessment, Permitting and Response and Measurement and Analysis segments. These increases were partially offset by 34.9 million lower environmental emergency response service revenues, lower treatment technology revenue within our Remediation and Reuse segment, and prior year revenues from the Discontinued Specialty Lab of 6.1 million.

Cost of revenues consists of all direct costs required to provide services, including fixed and variable direct labor costs, equipment purchases and rental, and other outside services, field and lab supplies, vehicle costs and travel-related expenses. Variable costs of revenues generally follow the same trends as revenue, while fixed costs tend to change primarily as a result of acquisitions. 
 Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by 3.4 million driven primarily by a 7.3 million increase in direct labor costs and a 3.5 million increase in other cost of revenues, partially offset by a 5.7 million decrease in field supplies and equipment costs. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 59.1 , compared to 60.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This percentage decrease was driven primarily by revenue mix. 
 Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by 24.3 million driven primarily by a 26.8 million increase in direct labor costs, a 3.4 million increase in outside services costs, and a 6.1 million increase in other cost of revenues, partially offset by a 14.0 million decrease in field supplies and equipment costs. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 60.4 , compared to 61.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This percentage decrease was driven primarily by revenue mix.

Selling, general and administrative expense consists of general corporate overhead, including executive, legal, finance, safety, risk management, human resource, marketing and information technology related costs, as well as indirect operational costs of labor, rent, insurance and stock-based compensation. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased 4.0 million or 7.0 primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, which added 2.9 million to selling, general and administrative expense, and an increase in IT, travel and bad debt expenses, partially offset by lower labor and facilities cost. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased 15.4 million or 9.5 primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, which added 9.2 million to selling, general and administrative expense, as well as an increase in acquisition-related costs, facilities cost, and an increase in IT and travel expenses.

Assessment, Permitting and Response segment revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decline in revenues from environmental emergency responses of 12.8 million and 34.9 million, respectively, partially offset by strong organic growth of 5.1 million and 25.6 million, respectively, mainly within our consulting and advisory services, and the impact of acquisitions, which contributed 2.7 million to the increase in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Measurement and Analysis segment revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of strong organic growth of 8.5 million and 19.0 million, respectively, the impact of acquisitions, which contributed 1.6 million and 2.9 million, respectively, partially offset by the sale of the Discontinued Specialty Lab in December 2023, which contributed 2.0 million and 6.1 million to revenues in the respective prior year periods. 
 Remediation and Reuse segment revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by acquisitions. Specifically, acquisitions contributed 11.1 million and 57.9 million to the increase in revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These increases were partially offset by certain treatment technology project start dates that shifted beyond the second half of 2024.

Assessment, Permitting and Response Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a reduction in higher margin emergency response revenues. 
 Measurement and Analysis Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the operating leverage driven by higher revenue growth. 
 Remediation and Reuse Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher revenues. Improved Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by acquisitions and improved Matrix margins. Improved segment Adjusted EBITDA margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by acquisitions. 
 Corporate and other costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.5 million primarily due to lower payroll related costs of 0.5 million and the timing of various other expenses including audit and other marketing related costs. Corporate and other costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 million primarily due to higher travel and IT costs as well as an increase in professional fees. Corporate costs as a percentage of revenues were lower in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, other commitments and contractual obligations. We consider liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and other sources, including availability under our credit facility, and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities. 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have been borrowings under our credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements, proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and cash generated by operating activities. Historically, we have financed our operations and acquisitions from a combination of cash generated from operations, periodic borrowings under senior secured credit facilities, and proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock. Our primary cash needs are for day to day operations, to fund working capital requirements, to fund our acquisition strategy and any related cash earn-out obligations, to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and dividends on our Series A-2 Preferred Stock, and to make capital expenditures. Additionally, in connection with certain acquisitions, we agree to earn-out provisions and other purchase price adjustments that may require future payments. We may make up to 58.6 million in aggregate earn-out payments between the years 2024 and 2026 in connection with the acquisitions of Sensible, Vandrensning, EPIC, 2DOT, Spirit and Origins, of which up to 23.4 million may be paid only in cash, up to 13.1 million may be paid only in common stock and up to 22.1 million may be paid in cash or, at our option, in common stock. See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 We expect to continue to fund our liquidity requirements, including any cash earn-out payments that may be required in connection with acquisitions, through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the short- and long-term.

Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate from period-to-period as earnings, working capital needs and the timing of payments for contingent consideration, taxes, bonus payments and other operating items impact reported cash flows. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 9.7 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 41.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period decrease of 51.2 million was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and contract assets of 45.9 million driven by higher revenues, the previously disclosed temporary invoicing delays associated with the integration of Matrix, which is substantially addressed and collections are returning to a normal cadence, and slow payments on a single large US government funded project, which are expected to be resolved by year end. The year over year change was also impacted by a decrease in accrued payroll and benefits of 4.9 million following larger bonus payments made in March 2024 than in the prior year. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 137.2 million, driven by cash paid for the acquisitions of EPIC, 2DOT, ETA, Paragon, Spirit, and Origins, net of cash acquired, of 113.0 million, 19.1 million in purchases of property and equipment, 3.4 million in payment of other purchase price obligations, and 2.1 million in proprietary software development costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 97.0 million, driven by cash paid for the acquisitions of Matrix, GreenPath, Vandrensning, Frontier and EAI, net of cash acquired, of 66.2 million, 25.0 million in cash consideration for purchases of property and equipment (which included the purchase of a 12.2 million replacement aircraft for use in emergency responses following an aircraft crash in February 2023), 2.8 million in proprietary software development costs, 2.3 million related to minority investment in certain companies, and the payment of assumed purchase price obligations of 1.0 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 136.6 million. Cash provided by financing activities was driven by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through a public offering of 121.8 million, net borrowing of 87.0 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 2.0 million, partially offset by a partial redemption of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock of 60.0 million, dividends on the Series A-2 Preferred Stock of 8.3 million and repayments of finance leases of 4.4 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 10.9 million. Cash used in financing activities was driven by the quarterly dividends on the Series A-2 Preferred Stock of 12.3 million, the 2021 Credit Facility term loan and the aircraft loan amortization payments of 9.1 million, the repayments of finance leases of 3.4 million, and the payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of 1.5 million, partially offset by proceeds received from the aircraft loan of 10.9 million and the exercise of stock options of 4.5 million. 
 Credit Facilities 
 See Note 12 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our 2023 Form 10-K includes a summary of the critical accounting policies and estimates we believe are the most important to aid in understanding our financial results. There have been no material changes to those critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed therein, other than as described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have market risk exposure arising from changes in interest rates on our credit facility, which bears interest at rates that are benchmarked subject to the Company s leverage ratio and SOFR. Based on our overall interest rate exposure to variable rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, which factors in our interest rate swaps on 150.0 million of debt, a 1.0 increase or decrease in interest rates on the term loan, aircraft loan, and revolver would impact our annual income (loss) before income taxes by approximately 1.0 million. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We experienced higher labor and significantly higher travel and other direct costs in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 as a result of inflation, particularly in our Measurement and Analysis and Remediation and Reuse segments. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also experienced, and continue to experience, higher labor costs as a result of inflation. We believe we have successfully raised prices in businesses with short term contracts to offset these inflationary effects. We also have and are continuing to raise prices on medium term (one to four quarter) contracts as these contracts are renewed or new contracts are won, and as a result have been able to offset much of the impact of inflation to date. We expect to continue to raise prices if direct costs continue to increase, and although inflation has increased our Selling, general and administrative expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we do not believe over a longer period of time that inflation will have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to additional and unanticipated significant sustained inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Foreign exchange risk exposure arises because we sell our services throughout the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Our exposure to this risk has increased significantly due to our acquisitions of Paragon and Matrix in Canada, EPIC in Australia, and to a lesser extent, Vandrensning in Europe. Revenues in certain foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those revenues are transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, our future operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of revenues denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. Additionally, previously invoiced amounts can be positively or negatively affected by changes in exchange rates in the course of collection. A 1.0 increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar exchange rate would impact revenues by approximately 1.5 million and would have a negligible impact on annual net (loss) income. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 38 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed or operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met. The design of our control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints, and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions. 
 39 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business activities, including those involving labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes and other matters. We are not a party to any litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to our risk factors from the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. The risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K, in addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are not the only risks facing we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 On July 1, 2024, we issued an aggregate of 30,953 shares of common stock to the former owner of Spirit as purchase price consideration. The issuance of common stock was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upo n Senior Securities.
