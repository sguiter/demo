shares of preferred stock and shares of common stock. The Company s ability to issue preferred stock may limit the Company s ability to obtain debt or equity financing as well as impede the implementation of the Company s business plan. The Company s ability to issue these authorized but unissued securities may also negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our debt or equity securities.

In such a restricted cash flow scenario, the Company would be unable to complete its business plan steps, and would, instead, delay all cash intensive activities. Without necessary cash flow, the Company may become dormant during the next twelve months, or until such time as necessary funds could be raised in the equity securities market.

While the Company is of the opinion that good faith estimates of the Company s ability to secure additional capital in the future to reach its goals have been made, there is no guarantee that the Company will receive sufficient funding to sustain operations or implement any future business plan steps.

General

Renewable Energy Acquisition Corp. (the Company was incorporated on June 21, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada.

The Company was formed to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business in either the renewable energy or the environmental industry and their related infrastructures. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities and the investigation of various potential business transactions, none of which has yet led to a definitive agreement.

(3)

Results of Operations

The Company had no revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Operating income (expense) of (573), and 268 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were directly related to maintaining the corporate entity, investigating opportunities pursuant to the Company s business plan and continued compliance with the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The operating loss increase was related to decrease of Standstill payment of 1,700 in the three months period ended 2024. The Company recorded 5,100 and 6,800 in standstill fees from FIP during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 FIP is 3,400 in arrears in the payment of standstill fees due under the standstill agreement, and neither party has terminated the agreement.

Effective July 11, 2022, the Company agreed to an amendment to the Standstill Agreement with FIP the Amendment ), pursuant to which, to the extent that previously paid fees have been less than the amount specified in the original Standstill Agreement, all such underpayments have been forgiven, and going forward, FIP will pay the Company periodic standstill fees of no less than enough money to cover the Company's ongoing expenses, plus an additional 20,000 on breaking escrow of its current Friends and Family private placement, plus an additional 13,500 when the Maximum equity in the round 500,000) is raised. Also, 30 days from the date their escrow is broken, FIP will pay the Company 1,500, and will continue to pay 1,500 on the First day of each successive month, except each April the payment(s) will be 8,000 as long as the Standstill Agreement remains in effect. From June,2023, the FIP payment amount increased to 1,700 per month. The Amendment further states that, if and when the Proposed Transaction closes, all remaining Agreed Expenses are to be paid in full. No other changes were made to the Standstill Agreement, which continues to be non-binding as to the completion of a transaction, and either party may terminate the Standstill Agreement at any time.

10 

Operating income (expenses) of (2,165), and (6,601) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were directly related to maintaining the corporate entity, investigating opportunities pursuant to the Company s business plan and continued compliance with the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The operating expense decrease was related to decrease of professional fee payment of 2,975 and an increase of Standstill income of 800. The Company recorded a total 23,600 and 22,800 in standstill fees from FIP during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 FIP is 3,400 in arrears in the payment of standstill fees due under the standstill agreement, and neither party has terminated the agreement.

Other expenses of 1,684 and 1,683 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were due to interest expenses on related party notes payable, notes payable, and short term advances.

Other expenses of 5,048 and 5,404 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were due to interest expenses on related party notes payable, notes payable, and short term advances.

The Company may or may not experience increases in expenses in future periods as the Company explores various options for the implementation of its business plan. However, at this time, the Company has not executed or consummated any definitive agreements with any identified business combination target. Further, it is anticipated that future expenditure levels may increase as the Company intends to fully comply with its periodic reporting requirements.

The Company does not expect to generate any meaningful revenue or incur operating expenses for purposes other than fulfilling the obligations of a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 unless and until such time that the Company acquires or participates in a business with revenue producing activities.

Loss per share for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (0.00), and (0.00), respectively, based on the weighted-average shares issued and outstanding at the end of each such period.

Loss per share for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (0.01), and (0.02), respectively, based on the weighted-average shares issued and outstanding at the end of each such period.

 Plan of Business

We were organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the advantages of being a publicly held corporation. We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a result of registering our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). After the consummation of a business transaction with an operating company, the surviving company resulting from the transaction will continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Although an operating company may choose to effectuate a business combination with a company that is trading on the OTC Bulletin Board in order to become public, the terms of such a transaction to the operating company may not be as favorable as those available from us as a non-trading reporting company. Therefore, we believe that we may be attractive to a private operating company seeking to become public.

We were formed as a vehicle to pursue a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business transaction with an operating business in either the renewable energy or the environmental industries and their related infrastructures. Nevertheless, we are not restricted from pursuing an opportunity in any industry at the discretion of the board of directors. The renewable energy industry and its related infrastructure generally includes the production, generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, heat, fuel and other consumable forms of energy through the utilization of renewable fuel sources such as, but not limited to, geothermal, biofuels, synfuels, wind, ocean waves, "clean coal," and waste stream pyrolysis; and the infrastructure needed to maintain and operate the facilities, services and installations used in the foregoing areas.

11 

Although we may consider a target business in any segment of any industry, we currently intend to concentrate our search for an acquisition candidate on companies in the following segments:

Wind electric generation, distribution and transmission;

Solar power;

Co-generation;

Bio-mass;

Synthetic gas production, distribution and transmission;

Energy efficiency and energy conservation related products and services;

Alternative transportation technologies;

Steam generation and distribution;

Alternative transportation technologies;

Energy storage technologies;

Other alternative and renewable energy technologies; and

The development, installation, financing, or manufacturing of any of the above.

Development Plan

Based on our proposed business activities, we are a "blank check" company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") defines "blank check" companies as, any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.

We also qualify as a "shell company," as defined under Rule 12b-2 adopted by the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions.

Management does not intend to undertake any effort to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements. We were organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the advantages of being a reporting company. After the consummation of a business combination with an operating company, the surviving company will continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which may be advantageous when establishing a public market. Furthermore, being a reporting company is required in order to seek a listing on a national exchange.

12 

We have a nominal amount of capital and will depend on our directors to provide us with the necessary funds to implement our business plan. We intend to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings. However, at the present time, we have not identified any business opportunity that we plan to pursue, nor have we reached any agreement or definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition or merger. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our officers and directors. Our officers and directors will collectively devote approximately five hours per week to searching for a target company until an acquisition candidate is identified and a transaction closed.

We believe that business opportunities may come to our attention from various sources, including, professional advisors such as attorneys, and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. We have no plan, understanding, agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for us. We can give no assurances that we will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given the limited funds that are expected to be available to us for implementation of our business plan. Furthermore, we can give no assurances that any acquisition, if it occurs, will be on terms that are favorable to us or our current stockholders. Discussions have been held from time to time with potential business combination candidates, and the Company has been paid standstill fees in connection with Letters of Intent that were entered into regarding potential business combinations. However, as of this date, no Letter of Intent has resulted in any definitive agreement being entered into with any party. We have flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In our effort to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:

Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;

Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;

Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;

Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements, or from other sources;

The cost of participation by us as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;

The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;

The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance, and other required items; and

Other relevant factors.

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which may make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or be able to fully investigate potential adverse factors concerning the opportunity to be acquired.

13 

Form of Acquisition

The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of us and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of us and such promoters. It is likely that we will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of our common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80 or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other tax free transaction provisions under the Code, all prior stockholders would retain 20 or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20 of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who are stockholders prior to the acquisition. Our present stockholders will likely not have control of our majority voting securities following an acquisition transaction. However, our present stockholders will benefit from such a transaction by retaining an equity interest in the surviving company, a cash payment in exchange for outstanding shares, or a combination of both cash and equity. As part of such a transaction, our present directors or officers may resign and one or more new directors or officers may be appointed in connection with the transaction.

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving us, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval. It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to us of the related costs incurred.

(5)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our cash provided in operating activities for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,845, which primarily reflects our net loss of 7,212, offset with an increase in accounts payable of 7,227 and in interest payable of 3,530 compared to our cash used in operating activities for nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 397, which primarily reflects our net income of 12,005, offset with an increase in accounts payable of 8,878 and in interest payable of 3,524.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital deficits of 191,364 and 184,152 respectively, including notes payable to stockholders of 83,819 and 83,819, respectively in each respective period. 

It is the belief of management and significant stockholders that they will provide sufficient working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the corporate entity. However, there is no legal obligation for either management or significant stockholders to provide additional future funding. Further, the Company is at the mercy of future economic trends and business operations for the Company s majority stockholder to have the resources available to support the Company. Should this pledge fail to provide financing, the Company has not identified any alternative sources. Consequently, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company estimates it cash requirement for the next 12 months to be approximately 32,000.

14 

The Company's need for working capital may change dramatically as a result of any business acquisition or combination transaction. There can be no assurance that the Company will identify any such business, product, technology or company suitable for acquisition in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company would be successful in consummating any acquisition on favorable terms or that it will be able to profitably manage the business, product, technology or company it acquires.

The Company has no current plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale or issuance of additional securities prior to the location of a merger or acquisition candidate. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to the Company to allow it to cover the expenses related to such activities.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.

Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note D of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.

I tem 4 - Controls and Procedures

(a)

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive and Financial Officer (Certifying Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Certifying Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officer concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC due to an inherent weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting due to our status as a shell corporation and having a sole supervising officer. However, our Certifying Officer believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the respective periods presented.
