 million, relating to securities, at September 30, 2024. Management concluded that for all other fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position, the unrealized loss was not due to issuer-specific credit-related factors and as a result was recognized in OCI. Where unrealized losses have not been recognized into income, it is primarily because the securities bond issuer(s) are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in estimated fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and non-issuer specific credit spreads. These issuers continued to make timely principal and interest payments and the estimated fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.

 Allowance for Credit Losses for Mortgage Loans 
 Evaluation and Measurement Methodologies 
 The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the mortgage loan s amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the mortgage loan. The loan balance, or a portion of the loan balance, is written-off against the allowance when management believes this amount is uncollectible. 
 The accrued interest receivable on mortgage loans is included in accrued investment income and totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Fixed Maturity Securities 
 The Company invests in U.S. corporate bonds, foreign corporate bonds and Structured Securities issued by VIEs. The Company is not obligated to provide any financial or other support to these VIEs, other than the original investment. The Company s involvement with these entities is limited to that of a passive investor. The Company has no unilateral right to appoint or remove the servicer, special servicer, or investment manager, which are generally viewed as having the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, nor does the Company function in any of these roles. The Company does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity; as a result, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary, or consolidator, of the VIE.

 8. Derivatives (continued) 

 The Company s collateral arrangements generally require the counterparty in a net liability position, after considering the effect of netting agreements, to pledge collateral when the amount owed by that counterparty reaches a minimum transfer amount. Certain of these arrangements also include credit-contingent provisions which permit the party with positive fair value to terminate the derivative at the current fair value or demand immediate full collateralization from the party in a net liability position, in the event that the financial strength or credit rating of the party in a net liability position falls below a certain level.

 _______________ 
 (1) After taking into consideration the existence of netting agreements. 
 (2) Substantially all of the Company s collateral arrangements provide for daily posting of collateral for the full value of the derivative contract. As a result, if the credit-contingent provisions of derivative contracts in a net liability position were triggered, minimal additional assets would be required to be posted as collateral or needed to settle the instruments immediately. Additionally, the Company is required to pledge initial margin for certain new over-the-counter OTC bilateral contracts between two counterparties OTC-bilateral derivative transactions to third-party custodians.

 _______________ 
 (1) Mortality rates vary by age and by demographic characteristics such as gender. The range shown reflects the mortality rate for policyholders between 35 and 90 years old. Mortality rate assumptions are set based on company experience and include an assumption for mortality improvement. 
 (2) The lapse rate range reflects base lapse rates for major product categories for duration 1-20. Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. For variable annuity guarantees, a dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in-the-money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. 
 (3) The utilization rate assumption for variable annuity guarantees estimates the percentage of contract holders with a guaranteed minimum income benefit GMIB or lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible in a given year. The range shown represents the floor and cap of the GMIB dynamic election rates across varying levels of in-the-money. For lifetime withdrawal guarantee riders, the assumption is that everyone will begin withdrawals once account value reaches zero which is equivalent to a 100 utilization rate. Utilization rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract s withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder. 
 (4) The withdrawal rate represents the percentage of account balance that any given policyholder will elect to withdraw from the contract each year. The withdrawal rate assumption varies by age and duration of the contract, and also by other factors such as benefit type. For any given contract, withdrawal rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. For variable annuity guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees. For variable annuity guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value. 
 (5) Long-term equity volatilities represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatilities are available. For any given contract, long-term equity volatility rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing MRBs.

 9. Fair Value (continued) 

 The Company does not develop unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value for all other assets and liabilities classified within Level 3; therefore, these are not included in the table above. The other Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily included fixed maturity securities and derivatives. For fixed maturity securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes, an increase (decrease) in credit spreads would result in a (lower) higher fair value. For derivatives valued based on third-party pricing models, an increase (decrease) in credit spreads would generally result in a (lower) higher fair value.

 Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made 
 For other matters, the Company is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts, and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and updates its accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews. 
 Sales Practices Claims 
 Over the past several years, the Company has faced claims and regulatory inquiries and investigations, alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities or other products. The Company continues to defend vigorously against the claims in these matters. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for sales practices matters. 
 Cost of Insurance Class Actions 
 Richard A. Newton v. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, filed May 8, 2020). Plaintiff has filed a purported class action lawsuit against Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. Plaintiff was the owner of a universal life insurance policy issued by Travelers Insurance Company, a predecessor to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. Plaintiff seeks to certify a class of all persons who own or owned life insurance policies issued where the terms of the life insurance policy provide or provided, among other things, a guarantee that the cost of insurance rates would not be increased by more than a specified percentage in any contract year. Plaintiff also alleges that cost of insurance charges were based on improper factors and should have decreased over time due to improving mortality but did not. Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, suppression and concealment, and violation of the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages, including punitive damages, interest and treble damages, attorneys fees, and injunctive and declaratory relief. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company filed a motion to dismiss in June 2020, which was granted in part and denied in part in March 2021. Plaintiff was granted leave to amend the complaint. On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion on consent to amend the second amended class action complaint to narrow the scope of the class sought to those who own or owned policies issued in Georgia; the motion was granted on January 23, 2023, and the third amended class action complaint was filed on January 23, 2023. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter. 
 Lawrence Martin v. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, filed April 6, 2021). Plaintiff has filed a purported class action lawsuit against Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. Plaintiff is the owner of a universal life insurance policy issued by Travelers Insurance Company, a predecessor to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. Plaintiff seeks to certify a class of similarly situated owners of universal life insurance policies issued or administered by defendants and alleges that cost of insurance charges were based on improper factors and should have decreased over time due to improving mortality but did not. Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiff seeks to recover compensatory damages, attorney s fees, interest, and equitable relief including a constructive trust. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company filed a motion to dismiss in June 2021, which was denied in February 2022. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, a subsidiary of Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, was initially named as a defendant when the lawsuit was filed, but was dismissed as a defendant, without prejudice, in April 2022. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter.

 matters where it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. For certain matters, the Company may not currently be able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or estimated range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of such loss. During the first quarter of 2024, an arbitration panel ruled in favor of a reinsurer seeking a premium rate increase retroactive to September 2019 resulting in a million loss, of which million was reported in universal life and investment product-type policy fees and million was reported in other expenses.

Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future.

 In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and bylaws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company s interests.

 For purposes of this discussion, BLIC, the Company, we, our and us refer to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company refers solely to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company and not to any of its subsidiaries. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. BHF and together with its subsidiaries, Brighthouse Financial ). This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with (i) the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere herein; (ii) our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 29, 2024; (iii) our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the First Quarter Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 9, 2024; (iv) our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (the Second Quarter Form 10-Q and, together with the First Quarter Form 10-Q, the Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC on August 9, 2024; and (v) our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2024. 
 Overview 
 We offer a range of annuity and life insurance products to individuals and deliver our products through multiple independent distribution channels and marketing arrangements with a diverse network of distribution partners. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, a Delaware corporation, is licensed to write business in all U.S. states (except New York), the District of Columbia, the Bahamas, Guam, Puerto Rico, the British Virgin Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY BHNY ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, is domiciled in New York and licensed to write business only in New York. 
 We are organized into the following segments: (i) Annuities, (ii) Life and (iii) Run-off, which consists primarily of products that are no longer actively sold and are separately managed. In addition, we report certain of our results of operations in Corporate Other. See Business Segments and Corporate Other included in our 2023 Annual Report, as well as Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our segments and Corporate Other. 
 
 Financial and Economic Environment 
 Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in the capital markets or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us. Equity market performance can affect our profitability for variable annuities and other separate account products as a result of the effects it has on product demand, revenues, expenses, reserves and our risk management effectiveness. The level of long-term interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can have a negative effect on the profitability for variable annuities, as well as the demand for, and the profitability of, spread-based products such as fixed annuities, index-linked annuities and universal life insurance. Low interest rates and risk premium, including credit spread, affect new money rates on invested assets and the cost of product guarantees. Insurance premium growth and demand for our products is impacted by the general health of U.S. economic activity. A sustained or material increase in inflation could also affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. The Federal Reserve Board decreased the target range for the federal funds rate in September and November 2024, and may decrease the target range again, which may negatively impact our business in certain respects, including our investment portfolio, by lowering the level of long-term interest rates and changing the shape of the yield curve. Inflation also increases our expenses (including, among others, for labor and third-party services), potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through to policyholders in our product prices. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally and dispelling it may require governments to pursue restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, which could constrain overall economic activity and inhibit revenue growth. Events involving limited liquidity, defaults, nonperformance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about events of these kinds or other similar risks, could adversely affect market-wide liquidity, which could increase the risk of a recession or an equity market downturn and negatively impact various portions of our business, including our investment portfolio. See Risk Factors Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks If difficult conditions in the capital markets and the U.S. economy generally persist or are perceived to persist, they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and Risk Factors Risks Related to our Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio is subject to significant financial risks both in the U.S. and global financial markets, including credit risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, market valuation risk, liquidity risk, real estate risk, derivatives risk, and other factors outside our control, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations included in our 2023 Annual Report.

 We continue to closely monitor political and economic conditions that might contribute to market volatility and their impact on our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives, such as global inflation, uncertainty and instability in certain asset classes (including commercial real estate), supply chain disruptions and recent geopolitical conflicts, including in Europe and the Middle East. See Risk Factors Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks and Risk Factors Risks Related to our Investment Portfolio included in our 2023 Annual Report for a detailed discussion of financial and economic impacts on our business, including the potential impacts of interest rate risk and inflation risk on our investments and overall business. 
 
 Regulatory Developments 
 We, including our insurance subsidiary, BHNY, and our reinsurance subsidiary, Brighthouse Reinsurance Company of Delaware, are primarily regulated at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. In addition, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company and BHNY are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions.

 Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
 liability for future policy benefits; 
 estimated fair values of market risk benefits MRB 
 estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; and 
 measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets. 
 In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 The above critical accounting estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Disclosures 
 We present certain measures of our performance that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other companies. 
 Adjusted Earnings 
 Adjusted earnings is a financial measure used by management to evaluate performance and facilitate comparisons to industry results. We believe the presentation of adjusted earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by the investor community and contract holders by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See Results of Operations for a reconciliation of adjusted earnings to net income (loss) attributable to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 Adjusted earnings, which may be positive or negative, focuses on our primary businesses by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends. The Company uses the term adjusted loss throughout this report to refer to negative adjusted earnings values. 
 The following are significant items excluded from total revenues in calculating adjusted earnings: 
 Net investment gains (losses); and 
 Net derivative gains (losses), excluding earned income and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment Investment Hedge Adjustments ). 
 The following are significant items excluded from total expenses in calculating adjusted earnings: 
 Change in MRBs; and 
 Change in fair value of the crediting rate on experience-rated contracts Market Value Adjustments ). 
 The provision for income tax related to adjusted earnings is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21 , net of impacts related to the dividends received deduction, tax credits and current period non-recurring items. 
 We present adjusted earnings in a manner consistent with management s view of the primary business activities that drive the profitability of our core businesses. The following table illustrates how each component of adjusted earnings is calculated from the GAAP statements of operations line items: 
 Component of Adjusted Earnings How Derived from GAAP (1) (i) Fee income (i) Universal life and investment-type product policy fees plus Other revenues . 
 (ii) Net investment spread (ii) Net investment income plus Investment Hedge Adjustments reduced by Interest credited to policyholder account balances (excluding Market Value Adjustments) and interest on future policy benefits. 
 (iii) Insurance-related activities (iii) Premiums less Policyholder benefits and claims , excluding interest on future policy benefits. 
 (iv) Amortization of DAC and VOBA (iv) Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs DAC and value of business acquired VOBA . 
 (v) Other expenses (v) Other expenses. (vi) Provision for income tax expense (benefit) (vi) Tax impact of the above items, calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21 , net of impacts related to the dividends received deduction, tax credits and current period non-recurring items. 
 
 _____________ _ 
 (1) Italicized items indicate GAAP statements of operations line items. 
 Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Accordingly, we report adjusted earnings by segment in Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Annual Actuarial Review 
 We typically conduct our annual actuarial review AAR in the third quarter of each year. As part of the 2024 AAR, for our universal life insurance with secondary guarantees ULSG business, we increased the long-term general account earned rate, driven by an increase in the mean reversion rate, from 3.75 to 4.00 . Also, with respect to our ULSG business, we updated assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including mortality, premium persistency, lapses and withdrawals. For our variable annuity business, we updated our annuitization, mortality, lapses and withdrawals, as well as separate account assumptions, including fund fees and allocations. For term participating and non-participating whole life insurance, we updated assumptions regarding mortality and lapses.

 The higher loss before provision for income tax was driven by the following unfavorable items: 
 higher losses from variable annuity guaranteed benefit riders, see Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Shield Annuity Liabilities for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 
 the net impact of embedded derivatives and equity options we use to hedge our non-variable annuity business, as equity markets increased more in the current period, resulting in a loss of 26 million, and increased less in the prior period, resulting in a gain of 74 million. 
 The higher loss before provision for income tax was partially offset by the following favorable items: 
 the impact of long-term interest rates on interest rate derivatives used to manage interest rate exposure in our ULSG business, as the long-term interest rate increased less in the current period, resulting in a loss of 196 million, and increased more in the prior period, resulting in a loss of 443 million; and 
 higher pre-tax adjusted earnings, as discussed in greater detail below. 
 The provision for income tax, expressed as a percentage of income (loss) before provision for income tax, resulted in an effective tax rate of 30 in the current period compared to 36 in the prior period. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impacts of the dividends received deduction, tax credits and current period non-recurring items.

 Adjusted earnings were 1.0 billion in the current period, an increase of 121 million. 
 Key net favorable impacts were: 
 lower net costs associated with insurance-related activities due to: 
 a net decrease in liability balances resulting from year-over-year changes made in connection with the AAR and other refinements; 
 partially offset by 
 an increase in liability balances in our ULSG business resulting from a reinsurance premium rate increase associated with the conclusion of a reinsurance arbitration; and 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 higher net investment spread due to: 
 higher average invested assets resulting from positive net flows in the general account; 
 higher investment yields on our fixed income portfolio, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio were invested at higher yields than the portfolio average; and 
 higher returns on other limited partnerships; 
 partially offset by 
 higher interest credited to policyholders due to higher account balances and prior period actuarial modeling improvements, net of changes made in the current period in connection with the AAR. 
 Key net unfavorable impacts were: 
 lower net fee income due to: 
 higher ceded cost of insurance fees related to the conclusion of the aforementioned reinsurance arbitration in our life and ULSG businesses, as well as our aging in-force ULSG business; 
 partially offset by 
 higher reinsurance fees on our fixed annuity business resulting from higher account balances; and 
 higher asset-based fees resulting from higher average separate account balances, a portion of which is offset in other expenses; and 
 higher other expenses due to: 
 higher asset-based variable annuity expenses resulting from higher average separate account balances, a portion of which is offset in fee income; and 
 higher variable and deferred compensation expenses; 
 partially offset by 
 lower operational expenses; and 
 lower transition services agreement expenses. 
 The provision for income tax, expressed as a percentage of pre-tax adjusted earnings, resulted in an effective tax rate of 17 in the current period compared to 16 in the prior period. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impacts of the dividends received deduction, tax credits and current period non-recurring items.

 favorable decreases in annuity guaranteed benefits liabilities due to increasing equity markets and interest rates, as well as changes made in connection with the AAR; 
 favorable changes in variable annuity hedges due to increasing equity markets; and 
 unfavorable changes in Shield embedded derivatives due to increasing equity markets, partially offset by changes made in connection with the AAR. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Annuity guaranteed benefits and Shield annuity liabilities performance was unfavorable for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by: 
 favorable decreases in annuity guaranteed benefits liabilities due to increasing interest rates and equity markets, partially offset by changes made in connection with the AAR; 
 unfavorable changes in variable annuity hedges due to increasing long-term interest rates; and 
 unfavorable changes in Shield embedded derivatives due to increasing equity markets. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility or disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets or financial asset classes can impact us adversely, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. Changing conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may affect our financing costs and market interest rates for our debt issuances. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see Overview Financial and Economic Environment, as well as Risk Factors Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks and Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investment Portfolio included in our 2023 Annual Report.

We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements using words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, may, will, could, intend, goal, target, guidance, forecast, preliminary, objective, continue, aim, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning, or that are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance.

 Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the actual future results of BLIC. These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.

 differences between actual experience and actuarial assumptions and the effectiveness of our actuarial models; 
 higher risk management costs and exposure to increased market risk due to guarantees within certain of our products;

 the potential material adverse effect of changes in accounting standards, practices or policies applicable to us, including changes in the accounting for long-duration contracts;

 the risks associated with climate change; 
 the adverse impact of public health crises, extreme mortality events or similar occurrences on our business and the economy in general; 
 the impact of adverse capital and credit market conditions, including with respect to our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital;

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 MetLife provides certain services to the Company on a transitional basis through services agreements. The Company continues to change business processes, implement systems and establish new third-party arrangements, as a subsidiary of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. We consider these in aggregate to be material changes in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Other than as noted above, there were no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls over financial reporting.
