 We capitalized interest costs of million and million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to construction in progress. 
 Term Loan Facility 
 Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at either: 1) one-month, three-month, or six-month term SOFR with a duration adjustment Adjusted Term SOFR ), subject to a floor, plus an applicable margin of ; or 2) the greater of various benchmark rates plus an applicable margin of . Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, interest was increased on a paid-in-kind basis at a rate between and PIK interest ), dependent on our net leverage ratio for the most recently reported fiscal quarter and subject to reduction upon the occurrence of certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. The PIK interest is payable on the loan maturity date of September 22, 2026. At September 30, 2024, the Term Loan Facility bore interest, including PIK interest, based on one-month Adjusted Term SOFR, at . 
 The Term Loan Facility requires quarterly principal payments of million with the remaining unpaid principal amount due at the loan maturity date. We may be required to make additional principal payments annually that are calculated as a percentage of our excess cash flow, as defined by the lender, based on our net leverage ratio. The Term Loan Facility is collateralized by all of our assets. The Term Loan Facility has a first lien on all domestic assets, other than accounts receivable and inventory and has a second lien on domestic accounts receivable and inventory. We were in compliance with all requirements under the Term Loan Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Term Loan Facility was issued at a million discount and we have capitalized an additional million in debt issuance costs. These costs are recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying amount of the associated long-term debt and amortized over the term of the debt. 
 We had an interest rate swap that changed the one-month LIBOR to a fixed rate of on million of the outstanding balance of the Term Loan Facility. During the first quarter of 2023, we terminated the interest rate swap and received cash proceeds of million, which was equal to its then fair value.

We may elect whether to use one-month, three-month, or six-month Adjusted Term SOFR. At September 30, 2024, using one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility would have been . We pay a commitment fee of for unused capacity under the ABL Facility and a fee on the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The final maturity date of the ABL Facility is March 22, 2026. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility, million of outstanding letters of credit, and million available for future borrowings under the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility has a first lien on domestic accounts receivable and inventory. We were in compliance with all requirements under the ABL Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 Sale-Leaseback Transactions 
 In March 2024, we sold three of our properties for an aggregate sales price of million, with the net proceeds used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. Concurrent with the sale, we entered into a 20-year lease agreement for these properties. Since the lease agreement allows for us to exercise renewal options that extend for substantially all of the remaining economic life, we have the ability to maintain the risks and rewards of ownership. Since the transaction did not transfer control of the assets, it cannot be accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. As a result, the properties remain on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the non-land assets will continue to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives. The million of gross proceeds was recognized as a financing obligation as a component of long-term debt. The monthly lease payments, which increase 3.0 each year, are being amortized as principal payments and interest expense based on an effective interest rate of . We incurred million in debt issuance costs related to this transaction, which are being amortized over the term of the debt. 
 million. Concurrent with the sale, we entered into a 5-year lease agreement that includes a repurchase option for this equipment. In May 2024, we sold additional pieces of manufacturing equipment for an aggregate sales price of million and entered into 5-year and 6-year lease agreements for the equipment. Since the three lease agreements allow for us to exercise an early buyout option, we have the ability to maintain the risks and rewards of ownership. Since the transactions did not transfer control of the assets, they cannot be accounted for as sales under ASC 606. As a result, the assets remain on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and will continue to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives. The million of gross proceeds was recognized as a financing obligation as a component of long-term debt. The monthly lease payments are being amortized as principal payments and interest expense on a weighted average effective interest rate of .

The Series D Preferred Stock has an initial liquidation preference of per share and is redeemable at our option in cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference then in effect. Series D Preferred Stock shares earn cash dividends at a rate of per year, payable quarterly in arrears, accruing whether or not earned or declared. If no cash dividend is paid, then the liquidation preference per share effective on the dividend date increases by per year. Beginning March 22, 2026, the cash dividend rate and in-kind dividend rate increase by per year. Cash dividends are required beginning on September 30, 2027. 
 The Series D Preferred Stock is classified as mezzanine equity, between liabilities and stockholders equity, because certain features of the Series D Preferred Stock could require redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock upon a change of control event that is considered not solely within our control. For initial recognition, the Series D Preferred Stock was recognized at a discounted value, net of issuance costs and allocation to warrants and a bifurcated embedded derivative. The aggregate discount is amortized as a deemed dividend through March 22, 2026, which is the date the dividend rate begins to increase by per year. Deemed dividends adjust additional paid-in capital due to the absence of retained earnings. 
 In accordance with ASC 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging - Embedded Derivatives, certain features of the Series D Preferred Stock were bifurcated and accounted for as derivatives separately. Note 15 discusses the accounting for these features.

 We are entitled to indemnification from the former shareholders of Autocam, subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in the agreement and plan of merger relating to the Autocam acquisition. Management believes the indemnification would include amounts owed for the tax, interest, and penalties related to this matter.

 In conjunction with our placement of the Series D Preferred Stock, we issued the 2021 Warrants to purchase up to million shares of our common stock. The 2021 Warrants were exercisable, in full or in part, at an exercise price of per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments in the event of certain future equity issuances, stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all of the 2021 Warrants were exercised on a cashless basis, resulting in the issuance of shares. 
 In conjunction with our placement of Series B Preferred Stock in 2019, we issued detachable warrants to purchase up to million shares of our common stock (the 2019 Warrants ). The 2019 Warrants, are exercisable, in full or in part, at any time prior to December 11, 2026, at an exercise price of per share, and are subject to anti-dilution adjustments in the event of future below market issuances, stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events.

 The fair value of the 2023 Warrants and 2021 Warrants is determined using the observable market price of a share of our common stock, less the per share exercise price (Level 1). 
 The fair value of the 2019 Warrants is determined using a valuation model that utilizes unobservable inputs to determine the probability that the 2019 Warrants will remain outstanding for future periods (Level 3). The probabilities resulted in a weighted average term of years as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Interest Rate Swap 
 On July 22, 2021, we entered into a fixed-rate interest rate swap agreement to change the LIBOR-based component of the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of (the 2021 Swap ). The 2021 Swap had a notional amount of million and a maturity date of July 31, 2024. We designated the 2021 Swap as a cash flow hedge at inception with cash settlements recognized in interest expense. During the first quarter of 2023, we terminated the 2021 Swap and received cash proceeds of million, which was the then fair value of the 2021 Swap. Since the 2021 Swap was an effective cash flow hedge and the forecasted interest payments remain probable of occurring, the gain was recognized as a reduction to interest expense through the original maturity date of July 31, 2024. 
 The following table presents the effects of the interest rate swap on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 Results of Operations 
 Factors That May Influence Results of Operations 
 The following paragraphs describe factors that have influenced results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that management believes are important to provide an understanding of the business and results of operations or that may influence operations in the future. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 We continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of current macroeconomic and geopolitical events, including changing conditions from ongoing military conflicts, inflationary cost pressures, elevated interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages and disruptions.

Table of Contents 

 Ongoing military conflicts continue to create volatility in global financial and energy markets, creating energy and supply chain shortages, which has added to the inflationary pressures experienced by the global economy. We continue to actively work with our suppliers to minimize impacts of supply shortages on our manufacturing capabilities. Although our business has not been materially impacted by these ongoing military conflicts as of the date of this filing, we cannot reasonably predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our customers or suppliers, will be impacted in the future, or the ways in which the conflicts may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The U.S. economy has experienced inflationary increases and elevated interest rates, as well as supply issues in materials, services, and labor due to economic policy and military conflicts. We cannot predict the future impact on our end-markets or input costs nor our ability to recover cost increases through pricing.

 Net Sales . Net sales decreased by 10.9 million, or 8.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of our Lubbock operations, rationalized volume at plants undergoing turnarounds, a customer settlement received in 2023 and unfavorable foreign exchange effects of 1.1 million. 
 Cost of Sales. Cost of sales decreased by 7.4 million, or 7.1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decrease in sales. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense decreased by 1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. 
 Other Operating Income, Net. Other operating income, net changed favorably by 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due the loss on sales of machinery and equipment recognized in 2023. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a reduction in the Term Loan balance due to the partial pay down of the outstanding balance with proceeds from the sale of our Lubbock operations.

 Other Income, Net. Other income, net increased by 3.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the 7.2 million gain on sale of our Lubbock operations, partially offset by noncash derivative mark-to-market loses recognized during the current quarter compared to derivative gains recognized in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Benefit (Provision) For Income Taxes . Our effective tax rate was (23.5) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was unfavorably impacted due to the accrual of tax on non-permanently reinvested unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and by the limitation on the amount of tax benefit recorded for losses in certain jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that a future tax benefit may not be realized. 
 Share of Net Income from Joint Venture. Share of net income from the JV increased by 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher sales and increased gross margins, partially offset by higher fixed costs.

 Net Sales . Net sales decreased by 19.0 million, or 5.0 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to he sale of our Lubbock operations, customer settlements received in 2023, rationalized volume at plants undergoing turnarounds and unfavorable foreign exchange effects of 1.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by the net impact of contractual pass-through material pricing provisions. 
 Cost of Sales. Cost of sales decreased by 21.2 million, or 6.6 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower sales volume and lower labor costs associated with facility closures. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased by 1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher travel and stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower salaries due to a reduction in headcount. 
 Other Operating Income, Net. Other operating income, net changed favorably by 2.8 million primarily due to increased sublease income earned on closed facilities. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by 1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher average interest rates, a decrease in the gain recognized on interest rate swap and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs.

 Changes in Financial Condition from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 
 Overview 
 From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, total assets decreased by 27.8 million primarily due to decreases in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets due to depreciation and amortization. Additionally, accounts receivable, inventory and property, plant and equipment decreased due to the sale of our Lubbock operations during the quarter. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our investment in a joint venture. 
 From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, total liabilities decreased by 20.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in other non-current liabilities due to the exercise of warrants in 2024 and a reduction in long-term debt due to the partial pay down of the outstanding balance with proceeds from the sale of our Lubbock operations. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities. 
 Working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, was 85.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 100.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to increases in the current maturities of long-term debt and an increase in other current liabilities. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash provided by operations was 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 23.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to an increase in accounts receivable, a decrease in inventory during the first half of 2023 and an increase in accounts payable during the first half of 2023. In addition, the Company received a 3.9 million dividend from the JV in the third quarter of 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Cash provided by investing activities was 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with cash used in investing activities of 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The favorable change is primarily due to the 17.0 million received for the sale of the Lubbock operations during 2024. 
 Cash used in financing activities increased by 14.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt and debt issuance costs in 2024, partially offset by proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions in 2024 and proceeds from international loans in 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Credit Facilities 
 The principal amount outstanding under our Term Loan Facility as of September 30, 2024, was 114.2 million, without regard to unamortized debt issuance costs and discount. As of September 30, 2024, we had 21.9 million available for future borrowings under the ABL Facility. This amount of borrowing capacity is net of 9.9 million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2024, which are considered as usage of the ABL Facility. 
 The Term Loan Facility requires quarterly principal payments of 0.4 million with the remaining unpaid principal amount due on the final maturity date of September 22, 2026. We may be required to make additional principal payments annually that are calculated as a percentage of our excess cash flow, as defined by the lender, based on our net leverage ratio. Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at either: 1) one-month, three-month, or six-month Adjusted Term SOFR, subject to a 1.00 floor, plus an applicable margin of 6.875 ; or 2) the greater of various benchmark rates plus an applicable margin of 5.875 . Beginning with the second quarter of 2023, interest is increased on a paid-in-kind basis at a rate between 1.00 and 2.00 , dependent on our net leverage ratio, for the most recently reported fiscal quarter and subject to reduction upon the occurrence of certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. Based on the interest rate in effect at September 30, 2024, annual cash interest payments would be approximately 16.9 million. 
 The ABL Facility bears interest on a variable borrowing rate based on either: 1) Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 1.75 or 2.00 , depending on availability; or 2) the greater of the federal funds rate or prime, plus an applicable margin of 0.75 or 1.00 , depending on availability. We pay a commitment fee of 0.375 for unused capacity under the ABL Facility. 
 We were in compliance with all requirements under our Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility as of September 30, 2024. Both credit facilities allow for optional expansion of available borrowings, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 Sale Leaseback Transactions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into several sale-leaseback transactions. We received 16.9 million from the sale and leaseback of three properties, with the net proceeds used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. The effective interest rate of the transaction, which terminates in 20 years, is lower than the current borrowings on the Term Loan Facility. We received 8.3 million from the sale and leaseback of equipment, with 3.4 million of the net proceeds used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the balance used for ongoing operational investments. 
 Accounts Receivable Sales Programs 
 We participate in programs established by our customers which allows us to sell certain receivables from that customer on a non-recourse basis to a third-party financial institution. In exchange, we receive payment on the receivables, less a discount, sooner than under the customary credit terms we have extended to that customer. These programs allow us to improve working capital and cash flows at the same or lower interest rates as available on our ABL Facility. Our access to these programs is dependent on our customers ongoing agreements with the third-parties. Our participation in these programs is based on our specific cash needs throughout the year, the discount charged to receive payment earlier, the length of the payment terms with our customers, as well being subject to limits in our ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility agreements. 
 Other Receivables 
 In 2021, we filed a refund claim with the IRS as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Including interest accrued on the initial refund amount, we have a 12.1 million tax refund receivable at September 30, 2024, which is in the process of IRS review and approval. The timing of the receipt of the refund is expected in the first half of 2025. 
 Seasonality and Fluctuation in Quarterly Results 
 General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months as customers slow production, and sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. However, as a whole, we are not materially impacted by seasonality.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business due to use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting business in various foreign currencies. To mitigate the exposure to these market risks, we have established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing the management of financial market risks. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk due to our variable rate debt, which comprises a majority of our outstanding indebtedness. The nature and amount of borrowings may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. To manage interest rate risk, we have used, and may in the future use, interest rate swap agreements. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 114.2 million of principal outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, without regard to unamortized debt issuance costs and discount. A one-percent increase in one-month SOFR would have resulted in a net increase in interest expense of 1.1 million on an annualized basis. 
 At September 30, 2024, using Adjusted Term SOFR plus a 2.00 spread, any borrowings under the ABL Facility would have been at a 7.197 interest rate. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Translation of our operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies is impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. We invoice and receive payment from many of our customers in various other currencies. Additionally, we are party to third party and intercompany loans, payables, and receivables denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To help reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuation, we have incurred debt in euros in the past. Various strategies to manage this risk are available to management, including producing and selling in local currencies and hedging programs. We did not hold a position in any foreign currency derivatives as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
