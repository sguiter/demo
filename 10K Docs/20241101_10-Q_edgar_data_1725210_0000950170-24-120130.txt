GRAYSCALE ETHEREUM TRUST (ETH) 
 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 Shares. The creation of a Basket requires the delivery to the Trust of the amount of Ether represented by one Share immediately prior to such creation multiplied by 10,000. The redemption of a Basket requires distribution by the Trust of the amount of Ether represented by one Share immediately prior to such redemption multiplied by 10,000. The Trust may from time to time halt creations and redemptions for a variety of reasons, including in connection with forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences. The Trust s investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on Ether per Share) to reflect the value of Ether held by the Trust, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities. The Trust may also receive Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency as a result of the Trust s investment in Ether, in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement. Incidental Rights are rights to claim, or otherwise establish dominion and control over, any virtual currency or other asset or right, which rights are incident to the Trust s ownership of Ether and arise without any action of the Trust, or of the Sponsor or Trustee on behalf of the Trust; IR Virtual Currency is any virtual currency tokens, or other asset or right, received by the Trust through the exercise (subject to the applicable provisions of the Trust Agreement) of any Incidental Right. On July 29, 2019, the Sponsor delivered to the Custodian (as defined below), on behalf of the Trust, a notice stating that the Trust is abandoning irrevocably for no direct or indirect consideration, effective immediately prior to each time at which the Trust creates Shares, all Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such time. On May 23, 2024, the Trust delivered a supplemental notice to the Prime Broker, the Custodian and Coinbase Credit, Inc. providing that the Trust also will abandon irrevocably for no direct or indirect consideration, effective immediately prior to each time at which the Trust redeems Shares, all Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such time. The Sponsor has committed to cause the Trust not to take any Affirmative Action to acquire any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, thereby irrevocably abandoning any Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency to which the Trust may become entitled in the future. Because the Sponsor has now committed to causing the Trust to irrevocably abandon all Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency to which the Trust otherwise would become entitled in the future, and causing the Trust not to take any Affirmative Actions, the Trust will not receive any direct or indirect consideration for the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency and thus the value of the Shares will not reflect the value of the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. In addition, in the event the Sponsor seeks to change the Trust s policy with respect to Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, an application would need to be filed with the SEC by NYSE Arca seeking approval to amend its listing rules to permit the Trust to distribute the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency in-kind to an agent of the shareholders for resale by such agent. Grayscale Investments, LLC Grayscale or the Sponsor acts as the Sponsor of the Trust and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, Inc. DCG ). The Sponsor is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement. Grayscale is responsible for preparing and providing annual and quarterly reports on behalf of the Trust to investors and is also responsible for selecting and monitoring the Trust s service providers. As partial consideration for the Sponsor s services, the Trust pays Grayscale a Sponsor s Fee as discussed in Note 7. The Sponsor also acts as the sponsor and manager of other investment products including Grayscale Aave Trust (AAVE), Grayscale Avalanche Trust (AVAX), Grayscale Basic Attention Token Trust (BAT) (OTCQB: GBAT), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (NYSE Arca: GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH) (OTCQX: BCHG), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) (NYSE Arca: BTC), Grayscale Bittensor Trust (TAO), Grayscale Chainlink Trust (LINK) (OTCQX: GLNK), Grayscale Decentraland Trust (MANA) (OTCQX: MANA), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC) (OTCQX: ETCG), Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) (NYSE Arca: ETH), Grayscale Filecoin Trust (FIL) (OTC Markets: FILG), Grayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN) (OTCQX: HZEN), Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC) (OTCQX: LTCN), Grayscale Livepeer Trust (LPT) (OTCQX: GLIV), Grayscale MakerDao Trust (MKR), Grayscale NEAR Trust (NEAR), Grayscale Solana Trust (SOL) (OTCQX: GSOL), Grayscale Stacks Trust (STX), Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM) (OTCQX: GXLM), Grayscale Sui Trust (SUI), Grayscale XRP Trust, Grayscale Zcash Trust (ZEC) (OTCQX: ZCSH), Grayscale Decentralized AI Fund LLC, Grayscale Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Fund LLC (OTCQB: DEFG), Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC (OTCQX: GDLC), and Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust recognized a gain of in connection with the Initial Distribution, which is included in net realized gain on investment in Ether sold for redemption of Shares on the Statement of Operations. It is expected that neither the Trust nor any beneficial owner of the Shares will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Initial Distribution. 

 and of one Ether at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the amount of Ether represented by each Share is primarily a result of the Initial Distribution and periodic withdrawal of Ether to pay the Sponsor s Fee. The cost basis of investments in Ether recorded by the Trust is the fair value of Ether, as determined by the Trust, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date of transfer to the Trust by the Authorized Participant, or Liquidity Provider, based on the Creation Baskets. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating, and redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the value of Shares or Ether. On October 2, 2023, NYSE Arca filed an application with the SEC pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act to list the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca. On April 23, 2024, the Sponsor filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3, as amended through July 18, 2024, to register the Shares of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933. On May 23, 2024, the SEC approved NYSE Arca s 19b-4 application to list the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product and on July 22, 2024, the Sponsor authorized the commencement of a redemption program once the registration statement on Form S-3, as amended, was declared effective.

on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Trust has defined the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. As of, and during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Trust did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax amounts. However, the Sponsor s conclusions concerning its determination of more-likely-than-not tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation guidance, and ongoing analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Sponsor of the Trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions related to federal, state and local income taxes existed as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . 

 and Shares of the Trust were held by related parties of the Trust, respectively. Genesis Global Trading, Inc. filed a certificate of dissolution during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and has therefore been removed from the list of related parties. The Sponsor s indirect parent, an affiliate of the Trust, holds a minority interest in Coinbase, Inc., the parent company of the Custodian, that represents less than of Coinbase, Inc. s ownership. In accordance with the Trust Agreement governing the Trust, the Trust pays a fee to the Sponsor, calculated as of the aggregate value of the Trust s assets, less its liabilities (which include any accrued but unpaid expenses up to, but excluding, the date of calculation), 

 15 

Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currencies have been distributed in payment of the Sponsor s Fee during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As partial consideration for receipt of the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor is obligated under the Trust Agreement to assume and pay all fees and other expenses incurred by the Trust in the ordinary course of its affairs, excluding taxes, but including marketing fees; administrator fees, if any; custodian fees; transfer agent fees; trustee fees; the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including customary legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) in an amount up to in any given fiscal year; ordinary course legal fees and expenses; audit fees; regulatory fees, including, if applicable, any fees relating to the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; printing and mailing costs; the costs of maintaining the Trust s website and applicable license fees (together, the Sponsor-paid Expenses ), provided that any expense that qualifies as an Additional Trust Expense will be deemed to be an Additional Trust Expense and not a Sponsor-paid Expense. The Trust may incur certain extraordinary, non-recurring expenses that are not Sponsor-paid Expenses, including, but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of shareholders, any indemnification of the Custodian or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust, the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) to the extent exceeding in any given fiscal year and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters (collectively Additional Trust Expenses ). In such circumstances, the Sponsor or its delegate (i) will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the Vault Balance Ether in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses and (ii) may either (x) cause the Trust (or its delegate) to convert such Ether into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate or (y) when the Sponsor incurs such expenses on behalf of the Trust, cause the Trust (or its delegate) to deliver such Ether in kind to the Sponsor, in each case in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Trust incurred Sponsor s Fees of and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Trust incurred Sponsor s Fees of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were accrued and unpaid Sponsor s Fees.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Sponsor did t pay any Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust. On March 2, 2022, the Board of the Sponsor (the Board approved the pur chase by DCG, the indirect parent company of the Sponsor, of up to an aggregate total of million worth of Shares of the Trust and shares of any of the following five investment products the Sponsor also acts as the sponsor and manager of, including Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (NYSE Arca: GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH) (OTCQX: BCHG), Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC (OTCQX: GDLC), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC) (OTCQX: ETCG), and Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM) (OTCQX: GXLM).

Ratios of net investment loss and expenses to average net assets have been annualized. An individual shareholder s return, ratios, and per Share performance may vary from those presented above based on the timing of Share transactions. The amount shown for a Share outstanding throughout the period may not correlate with the Statement of Operations for the period due to the number of Shares issued in Creations occurring at an operational value derived from an operating metric as defined in the Trust Agreement. Total return is calculated assuming an initial investment made at the Principal Market NAV at the beginning of the period and assuming redemption on the last day of the period. 

, the fair value of Ether determined in accordance with the Trust s accounting policy was per Ether. On October 24, 2024, the Sponsor of the Trust announced its intention to change the name of the Trust to Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF, effective November 4, 2024. In connection with the name change the Sponsor plans to amend the Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement to reflect the name change, also effective November 4, 2024. Trading under the new name is expected to begin on November 4, 2024. Following effectiveness of the name change, Shares of the Trust will continue to trade on NYSE Arca under the trading symbol ETHE. There are no known events that have occurred that require disclosure other than that which has already been disclosed in these notes to the financial statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report, or in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements or other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Trust Overview 
 The Trust is a passive entity that is managed and administered by the Sponsor and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust holds Ether and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of Ether. On July 22, 2024, in connection with the approval of application under Rule 19b-4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on May 23, 2024 and the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-278880), the Sponsor authorized the commencement of a redemption program. Shares of the Trust began trading on NYSE Arca on July 23, 2024, following the effectiveness of the Trust s registration statement on Form S-3, as amended. The Trust issues Shares only in one or more blocks of 10,000 Shares (a block of 10,000 Shares is called a Basket to certain Authorized Participants from time to time. Baskets are offered in exchange for Ether. Through its redemption program, the Trust redeems Shares from Authorized Participants on an ongoing basis. As a passive investment vehicle, the Trust s investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on Ether per Share) to reflect the value of Ether held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities. While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in Ether, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to Ether. The Trust will not utilize leverage, derivatives or any similar arrangements in seeking to meet its investment objective. 
 Historically, the Trust has not met its investment objective and, prior to their uplisting to NYSE Arca on July 23, 2024, the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Ether held by the Trust, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial, although the Sponsor has observed that the Trust has begun to meet its investment objective more closely following the uplisting of the Shares to NYSE Arca. The Trust is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. 
 The ETH Trust Distribution 
 On July 23, 2024, the Trust completed its previously announced pro rata distribution of 310,158,500 shares of Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) (the ETH Trust to shareholders of the Trust as of July 18, 2024 (the Record Date ), as described in the Trust s definitive information statement on Schedule 14C, filed with the SEC on July 18, 2024 (referred to as the Initial Distribution ). In connection therewith, on July 23, 2024, the Trust contributed to the ETH Trust an amount of Ether equal to 10 of the total Ether held by the Trust as of the Record Date, equal to 292,262.98913350 Ether, as consideration and in exchange for the issuance of shares of the ETH Trust. 
 Subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the Trust s definitive information statement on Schedule 14C, filed with the SEC on July 18, 2024 (including with respect to the qualification of both the Trust and the ETH Trust as grantor trusts for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the proper allocation of existing tax basis between Shares of the Trust and shares of the ETH Trust), it is expected that neither the Trust nor any beneficial owner of the Shares will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Initial Distribution. Accordingly, it is expected that neither the Trust s contribution of Ether to the ETH Trust nor the Trust s distribution of shares in the ETH Trust to shareholders as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be reported to any beneficial owner of Shares (or to any intermediary holding Shares) as giving rise to income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or proceeds. Any beneficial owner of Shares who received shares of the ETH Trust in the Initial Distribution, and any intermediary holding Shares of the Trust or shares of the ETH Trust, should consult their own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution, including the proper allocation of existing tax basis between Shares of the Trust and shares of the ETH Trust. Please refer to the Trust s definitive information statement on Schedule 14C, filed with the SEC on July 18, 2024, for more information, including other U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Initial Distribution and ownership of shares of the ETH Trust.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition 
 The Trust considers investment transactions to be the receipt of Ether for Share creations and the delivery of Ether for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in Ether. The Trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Sponsor s Fee in Ether. 
 Principal Market and Fair Value Determination 
 To determine which market is the Trust s principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Trust s net asset value in accordance with U.S. GAAP Principal Market NAV ), the Trust follows Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurement , which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for Ether in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that Ether is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. 
 The Trust only receives Ether in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or a Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Trust looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider, may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets (referred to as Trading Platform Markets in this Quarterly Report), each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, Digital Asset Markets ). 
 In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Trust s principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order: 
 First, the Trust reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering AML and know-your-customer KYC regulations, and non-Digital Asset Trading Platform Markets that the Trust reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market. 

Second, the Trust sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of Ether traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months. 

Third, the Trust then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market. 

Fourth, the Trust then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Trust, Trading Platform Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to accessible Trading Platform Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, a Trading Platform Market has been selected as the Trust s principal market. 

The Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Trust has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trust s determination of its principal market. 
 The cost basis of Ether received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Trust at the fair value of Ether at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors. 
 20 

Investment Company Considerations 
 The Trust is an investment company for U.S. GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies . The Trust uses fair value as its method of accounting for Ether in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.

(1) Includes the impact of the Initial Distribution of 292,262.98913350 Ether, with a value of approximately 1,010.9 million to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), completed on July 23, 2024, as discussed in Note 4 of the notes to the unaudited financial statements. 

(2) Net assets in the above table and subsequent paragraphs are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP based on the Digital Asset Market price of Ether on the Digital Asset Trading Platform that the Trust considered its principal market, as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. 

Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Ether for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,777,449), which includes a realized gain of 32,416 on the transfer of Ether to pay the Sponsor s Fee, a realized gain of 2,459,785 on the sale of Ether to meet redemptions, a realized gain of 888,140 on the sale of Ether related to the Initial Distribution to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), and net change in unrealized appreciation on investment in Ether of 5,157,790). Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Ether for the period was driven by Ether price depreciation from 3,423.00 per Ether as of June 30, 2024, to 2,594.43 per Ether as of September 30, 2024. Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 1,815,452) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Ether, plus the Sponsor s Fee of 38,003. Net assets decreased to 4,329,796 at September 30, 2024, a 57 decrease for the three-month period. The decrease in net assets resulted from the aforementioned Ether price depreciation, the withdrawal of approximately 13,267 Ether to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee, the redemption of approximately 951,615 Ether, with a value of 2,859,603 from the Trust, and the Initial Distribution of approximately 292,263 Ether, with a value of 1,010,935 from the Trust, to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). 
 Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Ether for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 737,606), which includes a realized gain of 25,228 on the transfer of Ether to pay the Sponsor s Fee and net change in unrealized appreciation on investment in Ether of 762,834). Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Ether for the period was driven by Ether price depreciation from 1,925.83 per Ether as of June 30, 2023, to 1,679.48 per Ether as of September 30, 2023. Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 770,752) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Ether, plus the Sponsor s Fee of 33,146. Net assets decreased to 5,007,131 at September 30, 2023, a 13 decrease for the three-month period. The decrease in net assets resulted from the aforementioned Ether price depreciation and the withdrawal of approximately 18,846 Ether to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee. 
 21 

Net realized and unrealized gain on investment in Ether for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,595,216, which includes a realized gain of 131,970 on the transfer of Ether to pay the Sponsor s Fee, a realized gain of 2,459,785 on the sale of Ether to meet redemptions, a realized gain of 888,140 on the sale of Ether related to the Initial Distribution to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), and net change in unrealized appreciation on investment in Ether of 1,884,679). Net realized and unrealized gain on investment in Ether for the period was driven by Ether price appreciation from 2,281.10 per Ether as of December 31, 2023, to 2,594.43 per Ether as of September 30, 2024. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 1,442,280 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized gain on investment in Ether, less the Sponsor s Fee of 152,936. Net assets decreased to 4,329,796 at September 30, 2024, a 36 decrease for the nine-month period. The decrease in net assets resulted from the withdrawal of approximately 49,871 Ether to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee, the redemption of approximately 951,615 Ether, with a value of 2,859,603 from the Trust, and the Initial Distribution of approximately 292,263 Ether, with a value of 1,010,935 from the Trust, to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), partially offset by the aforementioned Ether price appreciation. 
 Net realized and unrealized gain on investment in Ether for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1,455,596, which includes a realized gain of 74,021 on the transfer of Ether to pay the Sponsor s Fee and net change in unrealized appreciation on investment in Ether of 1,381,575. Net realized and unrealized gain on investment in Ether for the period was driven by Ether price appreciation from 1,201.33 per Ether as of December 31, 2022, to 1,679.48 per Ether as of September 30, 2023. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 1,357,933 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized gain on investment in Ether, less the Sponsor s Fee of 97,663. Net assets increased to 5,007,131 at September 30, 2023, a 37 increase for the nine-month period. The increase in net assets resulted from the aforementioned Ether price appreciation, partially offset by the withdrawal of approximately 56,273 Ether to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee. 
 Cash Resources and Liquidity 
 The Trust only receives and holds cash in order to facilitate creations and redemptions pursuant to Cash Orders, and has not otherwise had or maintained a cash balance at any time since inception. When selling Ether in the Digital Asset Market to pay Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust, the Sponsor endeavors to sell the exact amount of Ether needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than Ether. In addition, upon the consummation or deemed failure of a Cash Order to create or redeem Baskets, the Trust will promptly return any excess cash it continues to hold with respect to such Cash Order to the applicable counterparty. As a consequence, the Sponsor expects that the Trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, the Trust is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report was the Sponsor s Fee. The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.

(1) Represents the impact of the Initial Distribution of 292,262.98913350 Ether, with a value of approximately 1,010.9 million to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), completed on July 23, 2024, as discussed in Note 4 of the notes to the unaudited financial statements. 

(2) The Trust performed an assessment of the principal market at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and identified the principal market as Coinbase. 

(3) As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Principal Market NAV per Share was calculated using the fair value of Ether based on the price provided by Coinbase, the Digital Asset Trading Platform that the Trust considered its principal market, as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. Prior to February 23, 2024, Principal Market NAV was referred to as NAV and Principal Market NAV per Share was referred to as NAV per Share. 

(4) The Trust s NAV per Share is derived from the Index Price as represented by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Trust s NAV per Share is calculated using a non-GAAP methodology where the price is derived from multiple Digital Asset Trading Platforms. Prior to February 23, 2024, NAV was referred to as Digital Asset Holdings and NAV per Share was referred to as Digital Asset Holdings per Share. See Item 1. Business Overview of the ETH Industry and Market ETH Value The Index and the Index Price in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the Index and the Index Price. The Digital Asset Trading Platforms included in the Index as of September 30, 2024 were Coinbase, Kraken, LMAX Digital and Crypto.com. The Digital Asset Trading Platforms included in the Index as of September 30, 2023 were Coinbase, Kraken and LMAX Digital. See Item 1. Business Valuation of ETH and Determination of NAV in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the Trust s NAV per Share. 

For accounting purposes prior to July 23, 2024, the Trust reflected creations and the Ether receivable for proceeds with respect to such creations on the date of receipt of a notification of a creation but did not issue Shares until the requisite amount of Ether for proceeds was received. On July 22, 2024, in connection with the approval of application under Rule 19b-4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on May 23, 2024 and the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-3, as amended, the Sponsor authorized the commencement of a redemption program. Effective July 23, 2024, the date on which the Shares of the Trust began trading on NYSE Arca, the Trust reflects creations and redemptions and the Ether for proceeds receivable or payable with respect to such creations and redemptions, respectively, on the business day following the receipt of a notification of a creation or redemption order by an Authorized Participant. Creation and redemption orders are settled on T+1 or T+2, as established at the time of order placement, and therefore the Ether for proceeds receivable or payable with respect to such creations and redemptions, respectively, are recorded as a receivable or payable until the Ether are delivered or removed from the Trust for settlement. 
 23 

As of September 30, 2024, the Trust had a net closing balance of 1,668,881.33227926 Ether with a value of 4,326,958,697, based on the Index Price of 2,592.73 on September 30, 2024 (non-GAAP methodology). As of September 30, 2024, the total market value of the Trust s Ether was 4,329,795,795, based on the price of one Ether in the principal market (Coinbase) of 2,594.43 on September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Trust had a net closing balance of 2,981,357.71185740 Ether with a value of 5,007,309,531, based on the Index Price of 1,679.54 on September 30, 2023 (non-GAAP methodology). As of September 30, 2023, the total market value of the Trust s Ether was 5,007,130,650, based on the price of one Ether in the principal market (Coinbase) of 1,679.48 on September 30, 2023. 
 Historical NAV and Ether Prices 
 As movements in the price of Ether will directly affect the price of the Shares, investors should understand recent movements in the price of Ether. Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in the Ether price are not indicators of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, government regulation, security breaches experienced by service providers, as well as political and economic uncertainties around the world. 
 The Trust s performance prior to July 23, 2024 is based on market-determined prices on the OTCQX marketplace and on the Trust s performance without an ongoing share creation and redemption program. Prior to July 23, 2024, the Trust s Shares traded at both premiums and discounts to the value of the Trust s assets, less its expenses and other liabilities, which at times were substantial, in part due to the lack of an ongoing redemption program. Effective as of July 23, 2024, the Trust established an ongoing share creation and redemption program and the Shares of the Trust were listed to NYSE Arca. Hence, the Trust s performance for periods prior to July 23, 2024 is not directly comparable to, and should not be used to make conclusions in conjunction with, the Trust s performance for periods subsequent to July 23, 2024. 
 The following chart illustrates the movement in the Trust s NAV per Share (as adjusted for the Share Split for periods prior to December 17, 2020) versus the Index Price and the Trust s Principal Market NAV per Share (as adjusted for the Share Split for periods prior to December 17, 2020) from December 14, 2017 to September 30, 2024. For more information on the determination of the Trust s NAV, see Item 1. Business Overview of the ETH Industry and Market ETH Value The Index and the Index Price in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following table illustrates the movements in the Index Price from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2024. During such period, the Index Price has ranged from 109.83 to 4,776.32, with the straight average being 1,833.59 through September 30, 2024. The Sponsor has not observed a material difference between the Index Price and average prices from the constituent Digital Asset Trading Platforms individually or as a group.

The Trust s performance prior to July 23, 2024 is based on market-determined prices on the OTCQX marketplace and on the Trust s performance without an ongoing share creation and redemption program. Prior to July 23, 2024, the Trust s Shares traded at both premiums and discounts to the value of the Trust s assets, less its expenses and other liabilities, which at times were substantial, in part due to the lack of an ongoing redemption program. Effective as of July 23, 2024, the Trust established an ongoing share creation and redemption program and the Shares of the Trust were listed to NYSE Arca. Hence, the Trust s performance for periods prior to July 23, 2024 are not directly comparable to, and should not be used to make conclusions in conjunction with, the Trust s performance for periods subsequent to July 23, 2024. 
 The following chart sets out the historical closing prices for the Shares as reported by OTCQX and the Trust s NAV per Share from June 20, 2019 to July 22, 2024.

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Sponsor and an affiliate of the Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ), are currently parties to certain legal proceedings. Although the Trust is not a party to these proceedings, the Trust may in the future be subject to legal proceedings or disputes. 
 On January 30, 2023, Osprey Funds, LLC Osprey filed a suit in Connecticut Superior Court against the Sponsor alleging that statements the Sponsor made in its advertising and promotion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On April 17, 2023, the Sponsor filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and, following briefing, a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on June 26, 2023. On October 23, 2023, the Court denied the Sponsor s motion to dismiss. On November 6, 2023, the Sponsor filed a motion for reargument of the Court s order denying the Sponsor s motion to dismiss. On November 16, 2023, Osprey filed an opposition to the Sponsor s motion for reargument, and on November 30, 2023, the Sponsor filed a reply in further support of its motion for reargument. On March 11, 2024, the Court denied the Sponsor s motion for reargument. On March 25, 2024, the Sponsor filed an application for interlocutory appeal. On March 28, 2024, Osprey filed an opposition to the Sponsor s application for interlocutory appeal. On April 1, 2024, the Court denied the Sponsor s application for interlocutory appeal. On April 10, 2024, Osprey filed a motion to amend the complaint. The amended complaint went into effect on April 25, 2024. A scheduling order was entered by the Court with trial scheduled to begin on July 15, 2025. On July 31, 2024, the Sponsor filed a motion to strike the amended complaint. On August 30, 2024, Osprey filed an opposition to the Sponsor s motion to strike the amended complaint. On October 11, 2024, the Court denied the Sponsor s motion to strike.

 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Sponsor does not expect the foregoing proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Trust s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Sponsor and/or the Trust may be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes in the future.
