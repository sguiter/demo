 Notes

 (Unaudited) 

million as of September 30, 2024. 

The
Company believes that it has the ability to fund, from cash on hand, its operating costs and anticipated drilling operations for at least
the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. 

The
actual timing and number of wells drilled during 2024 and beyond will be principally controlled by the operators of the Company s
acreage, based on a number of factors, including but not limited to availability of financing, performance of existing wells on the subject
acreage, energy prices and industry condition and outlook, costs of drilling and completion services and equipment and other factors
beyond the Company s control or that of its operators. 

In
the event that the Company pursues additional acreage acquisitions or expands its drilling plans, the Company may be required to secure
additional funding beyond our resources on hand. While the Company may, among other efforts, seek additional funding from at-the-market 
sales of common stock, and private sales of equity and debt securities, it presently does not have any commitments to provide additional
funding, has limited shares of common stock available to support capital raising efforts and there can be no assurance that the Company
can secure the necessary capital to fund its share of drilling, acquisition or other costs on acceptable terms or at all. If, for any
reason, the Company is unable to fund its share of drilling and completion costs, it would forego participation in one or more of such
wells. In such event, the Company may be subject to penalties or to the possible loss of some of its rights and interests in prospects
with respect to which it fails to satisfy funding obligations and it may be required to curtail operations and forego opportunities.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking
Information 

This
Form 10-Q quarterly report of Houston American Energy Corp. (the Company for the three months ended September 30,
2024, contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created
thereby. To the extent that there are statements that are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute
forward-looking statements that, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. In any forward-looking statement, where we express
an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have
a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will be achieved or
accomplished. 

The
actual results or events may differ materially from those anticipated and as reflected in forward-looking statements included herein.
Factors that may cause actual results or events to differ from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included herein include
the Risk Factors described in Item 1A herein and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof.
We believe the information contained in this Form 10-Q to be accurate as of the date hereof. Changes may occur after that date, and we
will not update that information except as required by law in the normal course of our public disclosure practices. 

Additionally,
the following discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes contained in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Form 10-Q, as well as the Risk Factors in Item 1A and the financial
statements in Item 7 of Part II of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We believe certain critical
accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. A description
of our critical accounting policies is set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of, and for the three months
ended, September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes or updates to our critical accounting policies. 

Recent
Developments 

Drilling
and Operating Activity 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, no drilling activities were conducted on properties of Hupecol Meta. At September 30, 2024,
we had 4 wells on production in the U.S. Permian Basin. 

Our
Frost 2-H well was reworked during the quarter to repair its electric submersible pump. 

In
June 2024, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with EOG Resources, Inc. EOG with respect to the drilling
of six wells on the State Finkle Unit in the Wolfcamp formation in Reeves County, Texas. During June 2024, the Company elected to participate
in all six wells. 

Pursuant
to the joint venture agreement, EOG will act as operator of the unit and is the principal working interest owner in the unit. The unit
includes acreage subject to our existing O Brien lease. We will hold an approximately 0.00370542 working interest in the unit,
which is less than previously disclosed due to title issues. The first well was scheduled to spud June 23, 2024 with all six wells anticipated
to be in production by the second quarter of 2025. Houston American s cost of participating in the drilling program is estimated
at 550,000. Drilling activity continued during the quarter. 

12 

Operations,
Planned Drilling and Divestiture in Colombia 

At
September 30, 2024, Hupecol Meta operated four wells in the Venus Exploration Area of the CPO-11 block in Colombia. Each of the four
wells operated by Hupecol Meta were shut-in from February 20 to March 18, 2024 as a result of a dispute with local residents regarding
maintenance of the road serving the wells. 

During
the quarter, Hupecol Meta drilled the Jupiter 1 well, which resulted in a dry hole. 

We
own an approximately 18 interest in Hupecol Meta, representing an approximately 16 interest in the wells operated in the Venus Exploration
Area. We do not report results of Hupecol Meta in our consolidated operating results but include our investment in Hupecol Meta on our
balance sheet as Equity Investment Hupecol Meta with distributions from Hupecol Meta reported as Other Income 
on our Statement of Operations. 

Hupecol
Meta has advised that it intends to evaluate potential monetization or some form of divestiture of its assets in Colombia, including
the interest in the CPO-11 block held by Hupecol Meta. Pending the outcome of Hupecol Meta s evaluation of, and potential efforts
regarding, divestiture or monetization of the CPO-11 block in the fourth quarter of 2024, we have no planned drilling operations, or
other planned operations, in Colombia. As a result, we expect to continue to operate our existing wells in the CPO-11 block. There is
no assurance as to the timing or outcome of Hupecol Meta s potential monetization or divestiture of assets. 

Capital
Investments 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our capital investment expenditures totaled 1,072,364, attributable to investments in our equity
investment in Hupecol Meta LLC Hupecol Meta ). 

Distributions
from Equity Investment 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received distributions, totaling 268,817 and 922,959, respectively, from
Hupecol Meta, representing our share of distributable net income and reflected as Other Income on our Statement of
Operations. 

Management and Board Changes 

On
November 11, 2024, subsequent to the period covered by this report, we sold 2,180,180 shares of our common stock to one investor for
aggregate proceeds of approximately 2.5 million. In connection with this transaction, John F. Terwilliger resigned as Chief Executive
Officer CEO ), and Peter Longo was appointed as CEO. Mr. Terwilliger remains an advisor to the Company until the end of
this year. Also, as part of the foregoing transaction, Mr. Terwilliger received 800,000 in exchange for the waiver of certain claims
pursuant to his change in control agreement with the Company. In addition, James A. Schoonover resigned as a director on November 11,
2024, and Robert J. Bailey was appointed as a director. 

Results
of Operations 

Oil
and Gas Revenues. Total oil and gas revenues increased 15 to 130,239 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
 112,994 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Oil and gas revenues declined 28 to 393,729 in the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 547,408 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in revenue was due to decreases in average
sales price of natural gas (down 92 ), oil production (down 28 ), and natural gas production (down 13 ), and partially offset by an increase
in average sales price of oil (up 6 ). 

The
following table sets forth the gross and net producing wells, net oil and gas production volumes and average hydrocarbon sales prices
for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

The
change in production volumes was primarily attributable to the natural decline in production. 

The
change in average oil and natural gas sales price realized reflects global energy trends. 

Oil
and gas sales revenues are entirely attributable to our U.S. properties. 

13 

Lease
Operating Expenses. Lease operating expenses increased 78 to 229,210 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from
 128,918 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Lease operating expenses increased 55 to 534,443 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, from 344,318 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in lease operating expenses
was attributable to additional severance tax expense from prior periods and an increase in production expenses during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

Lease
operating expenses are entirely attributable to our U.S. properties and exclude lease operating expenses of Hupecol Meta. 

Depreciation
and Depletion Expense. Depreciation and depletion expense was 39,994 and 23,749 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively, and 103,079 and 115,645 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in depreciation
and depletion was principally due to the decline in oil production during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

General
and Administrative Expenses (excluding stock-based compensation). General and administrative expense decreased by 10 to 280,260
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 312,344 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased 22 to
 930,401 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,196,463 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a bonus of 200,000 paid to our CEO in the second quarter of 2023,
which was not repeated this year. 

Stock-Based
Compensation. Stock-based compensation decreased to 19,048 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 82,461 during
nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 95,205 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 212,982 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other
Income (Expense) . Other income/expense, net, totaled 293,505 of income during the three months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to 626,052 of income during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and totaled 1,007,102 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to 1,349,162 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other income consisted of equity
investment distributions totaling 922,959 and 1,235,101, respectively, from Hupecol Meta, representing our share of distributable
net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and interest income on cash balances during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In mid-October 2024 the Company received a notification for a cash call from Hupecol Meta, LLC for the amount of
 859,246 for anticipated costs related to the Jupiter #1 well. 

Financial
Condition 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources. At September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 2,847,296 and working capital of 2,772,692, compared to
a cash balance of 4,059,182 and working capital of 3,917,231 at December 31, 2023. 

Cash
Flows. Operating activities used 139,522 of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash outflows of
 211,463 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to a bonus of
 200,000 paid to our CEO in the second quarter of 2023, which was not repeated this year. 

Investing
activities used cash of 1,072,364 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,954,515 used during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in investing activities for both periods was attributable to investments in Hupecol Meta to support
our share of costs in Colombia. 

Financing
activities provided 0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,652,000 provided during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to funds
received from the sale of common stock in the company s 2022 ATM offering. 

Long-Term
Liabilities . At September 30, 2024, we had long-term liabilities of 71,620, compared to 152,904 at December 31, 2023. Long-term
liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consisted of a reserve for plugging costs and the long-term lease liability. 

Capital
and Exploration Expenditures and Commitments. Our principal capital and exploration expenditures
relate to ongoing efforts to acquire, drill and complete prospects. During 2023, capital expenditures relating to Hupecol Meta increased
with our investments in Hupecol Meta to fund our share of costs associated with the initial wells drilled on the CPO-11 block. Based
on discussions with Hupecol Meta, we anticipate that one additional vertical well will be drilled on the CPO-11 block by the end
of 2024 pending efforts by Hupecol Meta to monetize its interest in the CPO-11 block. Our costs relating to the drilling of such well
is estimated at approximately 550,000. There are no present plans to conduct additional drilling
operations on our U.S. properties. The actual timing and number of well operations undertaken, if any, will be principally controlled
by the operators of our acreage based on a number of factors, including but not limited to availability of financing, performance of
existing wells on the subject acreage, energy prices and industry condition and outlook, costs of drilling and completion services and
equipment and other factors beyond our control or that of our operators. 

14 

In
addition to possible operations on our existing acreage holdings, we continue to evaluate drilling prospects in which may acquire an
interest and participate. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 1,072,364 for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties, consisting
of capital contributions to Hupecol Meta. The 1,072,364 invested in Hupecol Meta was capitalized to our equity investment in Hupecol
Meta. 

As
our allocable share of well costs will vary depending on the timing and number of wells drilled as well as our working interest in each
such well and the level of participation of other interest owners, we have not established a drilling budget but will budget on a well-by-well
basis as our operators propose wells. We believe that we have the ability, through our cash on-hand, to fund operations and our cost
for all planned wells expected to be drilled during 2024. 

In
the event that we pursue additional acreage acquisitions or expand our drilling plans, we may be required to secure additional funding
beyond our resources on hand. While we may, among other efforts, seek additional funding from at-the-market sales of common
stock, and private sales of equity and debt securities, we presently have limited authorized shares of common stock available for issuance
to support equity capital raises and we have no commitments to provide additional funding, and there can be no assurance that we can
secure the necessary capital to fund our share of drilling, acquisition or other costs on acceptable terms or at all. If, for any reason,
we are unable to fund our share of drilling and completion costs and fail to satisfy commitments relative to our interest in our acreage,
we may be subject to penalties or to the possible loss of some of our rights and interests in prospects with respect to which we fail
to satisfy funding commitments and we may be required to curtail operations and forego opportunities. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
had no off-balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at September 30, 2024.

 QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Commodity
Price Risk 

The
price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth.
Crude oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor
changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to
be volatile in the future. The price we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our control. 

We
have not historically entered into any hedges or other transactions designed to manage, or limit, exposure to oil and gas price volatility.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of September 30, 2024. Such conclusion reflects the 2013 departure of our chief financial officer and assumption of duties of principal
financial officer by our chief executive officer and the resulting lack of an appropriate level of accounting knowledge and experience
commensurate with the financial reporting requirements for a public company, in particular with respect to technical accounting knowledge
regarding accounting for certain transactions, and a related lack of segregation of duties. Until we are able to remedy these material
weaknesses, we are relying on third party consultants to assist with financial reporting.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
