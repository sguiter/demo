Company prior to the Merger are those of Tevogen Bio. All information related to the common stock of Tevogen Bio prior to the Closing

cash and financial resources to operate for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these unaudited consolidated financial
statements. The Company does not plan to initiate a clinical trial until additional funding is received. 

Management
regularly evaluates different strategies to obtain funding for operations for subsequent periods. These strategies may include but are
not limited to private placements of securities, licensing and/or marketing arrangements, partnerships with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology
companies, and public offerings of securities. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms and the Company may
not be able to enter into strategic alliances or other arrangements on favorable terms. The terms of any financing may adversely affect
the holdings or the rights of the Company s stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient funding, the Company could
be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion, or future commercialization
efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects. 

Operations
since inception have consisted primarily of organizing the Company, securing financing, developing licensed technologies, performing
research, conducting pre-clinical studies and a clinical trial, and pursuing and completing the Business Combination. The Company is
subject to risks associated with any specialty biotechnology company that requires considerable expenditures for research and development.
The Company s research and development projects may not be successful, products developed may not obtain necessary regulatory approval,
and any approved product may not be commercially viable. In addition, the Company operates in an environment of rapid technological change
and is largely dependent on the services of its employees and consultants.

rate between and . The difference between the cash received of upon issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock and
its estimated fair value was recognized as general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations during the
three months ended March 31, 2024. 

The
Company used a MCS valuation methodology to determine the fair value of the freestanding purchase option and remaining embedded
 purchase option associated with the Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024. The MCS methodology simulates the Company s
future stock price to estimate if and when the Trailing VWAP (as defined below) will reach per share, and discounts the resulting
payoff back to each valuation date using a present value factor. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of these
options include volatility of and discount rate of .

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU
2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 enhances reportable segment disclosures by requiring disclosures such as significant segment expenses, information
on the chief operating decision maker and disclosures for entities with a single reportable segment. Additionally, the amendments enhance
interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, and
contain other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact
on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

the Series B Preferred Stock was recorded to Merger transaction costs within the consolidated statements of operations. All of the issued

Agreement, the Company issued shares of common stock to the Lender during June 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
has drawn from the Facility with a remaining available for future financing over the remaining months. 

The
Loan Agreement includes a purchase option whereby the Lender has the option to purchase up to of shares of common stock at
a purchase price equal to of the Trailing VWAP per share (the million Purchase Option ). The million Purchase
Option only becomes exercisable once Trailing VWAP reaches per share. The million Purchase Option was determined to be a freestanding
derivative liability under ASC 815 and is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded to change in fair value of written
call option derivatives liabilities within the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows. 

The
Loan Agreement also includes a purchase option (the Additional Amount Purchase Option that is identical to the million
Purchase Option, except that the option is exercisable for an amount up to the then-remaining undrawn term loan amount under the Loan
Agreement at the time Trailing VWAP reaches per share. The Additional Amount Purchase Option was determined to be an embedded
derivative within the written loan commitment that requires bifurcation under ASC 815, and thus is carried at fair value with changes
in fair value recorded to change in fair value of written call option derivatives liabilities within the consolidated statements of operations
and consolidated statements of cash flows. 

The
 million Purchase Option and the Additional Amount Purchase Option are recorded to written call option derivative liabilities within
the consolidated balance sheet. 

The
Loan Agreement is a written loan commitment that is not eligible for the fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments .
However, management intends to elect the fair value option for future draws under this commitment, and therefore has expensed all issuance
costs associated with the Loan Agreement, which are comprised of the fair value of the shares of common stock issued to the
Lender as well as the issuance date fair value of the million Purchase Option and Additional Amount Purchase Option.

proceeds were to be used for working capital purposes by Semper Paratus with an outstanding balance of on the Closing Date
and remain outstanding at September 30, 2024. The notes payable do not accrue interest. The outstanding balance of the notes was required
to be repaid in full within five business days of the Merger, and the Company is therefore in default of its obligations at September
30, 2024. The notes default provisions do not require the Company to transfer any shares or pay any amounts to Polar. In May 2024,

Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage specialty immunotherapy company harnessing one of nature s most powerful immunological weapons, CD8+ cytotoxic
T lymphocytes CD8+ CTLs ), to develop off-the-shelf, precision T cell therapeutics for the treatment of infectious diseases
and cancers with the aim of addressing the significant unmet needs of large patient populations. We believe that sustainability and commercial
success in the forthcoming era of medicine will rely on ensuring patient accessibility through advanced science, innovative business
models, and engagement across the development lifecycle and healthcare system. We believe the full potential of T cell therapies remains
largely untapped, and aspire to be the first biotechnology company offering commercially attractive, economically viable, and cost-effective
personalized T cell therapies. 

We
believe our allogeneic, precision T cell technology, ExacTcell TM , represents a significant scientific breakthrough with the
potential to mainstream cell therapy with a new class of off the shelf - manufactured and stored for immediate use T cell therapies
with diverse applications across virology, oncology, and neurology. ExacTcell is a set of processes and methodologies to develop, enrich,
and expand single human leukocyte antigen HLA restricted CTL therapies with proactively selected, precisely defined targets.
HLA molecules are proteins that play an important role in the immune system s ability to recognize self versus foreign. 
There are numerous HLA types that vary from person to person. CD8+ CTLs, also known as killer T cells, are white blood cells that are
part of the immune system and destroy infected, malignant, or otherwise damaged cells. We are focused on using ExacTcell to develop allogeneic
therapeutics, meaning therapeutics that are intended to be infused in patients other than the original donor. 

18 

ExacTcell
therapies are based on carefully selected, naturally occurring CTLs that recognize targets of interest from the body s native T
cell receptor pool, unlike genetically engineered T cell therapies. CD8+ CTLs in ExacTcell-based products target multiple and distinct
antigens, with the aim to circumvent the impact of mutations in viruses and cancer cells that can render existing treatments ineffective.
ExacTcell is designed to maximize the immunologic specificity of our products in order to eliminate malignant and virally infected cells
while allowing healthy cells to remain intact. We believe this high degree of specificity has the potential to significantly reduce the
chances of cross-reactivity or adverse impact on healthy cells. Our confidence in ExacTcell is reflected in our development pipeline,
which has been carefully tailored to address the unmet needs of large patient populations grappling with life-threatening viral diseases,
both viral and non-viral induced cancers, and neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Through our Tevogen.AI artificial intelligence
initiative, we are exploring ways to deploy artificial intelligence-powered target detection to further accelerate our product development
pace, either internally or in collaboration with leading entities in the field of artificial intelligence, such as through our recently
announced enrollment in the Microsoft for Startups program. 

The
first clinical product of ExacTcell, TVGN 489, is being developed to fill a critical gap in COVID-19 therapeutics for the immunocompromised
and the high-risk elderly, with potential applications in both treatment and prevention of chronic lingering symptoms of the disease Long COVID ). Viruses, including COVID-19, hijack cellular machinery to transform infected cells into virus production
plants. Elimination of infected cells is necessary to allow them to be replaced by healthy, uninfected counterparts. TVGN 489 consists
of CTLs active against multiple precise, well defined, and well characterized targets across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The product progressed
from pre-discovery to the clinic in less than 18 months, and in January 2023, we completed the Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial
of TVGN 489 for the treatment of ambulatory, high-risk adult COVID-19 patients. No dose-limiting toxicities or significant treatment-related
adverse events were observed in the treatment arm. Secondary endpoints showing a rapid reduction of viral load and that infusion of TVGN
489 did not prevent development of the patients own T cell-related (cellular) or antibody-related (humoral) anti-COVID-19 immunity
were also met. None of the patients who participated in the trial reported progression of infection, reinfection, or the development
of Long COVID during the six-month follow-up period. These clinical observations were mirrored by laboratory evidence of the persistence
of TVGN 489 cells for at least six months after treatment. The results of the trial were submitted for peer-review and were published
in Blood Advances in June 2024. We believe these findings validate our initiative to develop off-the-shelf T cell therapies for
outpatient administration, targeting diseases that affect large patient populations for the very first time . We plan to
launch a pivotal trial of TVGN 489 in COVID-19 patients with B cell malignancies, with studies of other highly vulnerable populations
thereafter. TVGN 489 is also in pre-clinical development for treatment and prevention of Long COVID, and we have other product candidates
in our pipeline for other indications. 

Our
commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other protection of our proprietary intellectual
property to safeguard developed products and scientific methods, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate without infringing,
misappropriating, or otherwise violating the valid, enforceable proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing, misappropriating,
or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our ability to stop third parties from improperly making, using, selling, offering to
sell, or importing products without the right to do so may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents
or trade secrets that cover these activities. 

We
continue to build our intellectual property portfolio and seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing
patent applications. Our patent estate includes patents and patent applications with claims relating to our product candidates,
methods of use, and methods of preparing the product candidates. To date, our U.S. intellectual property portfolio includes three
U.S. patents relating to TVGN 489 for the treatment of COVID-19, nine pending U.S. patent applications, including two patent
applications relating to the treatment of COVID-19, five relating to the treatment of other viruses or cancer, and two related to
artificial intelligence-driven T cell target identification and receptor engagement. Our portfolio also includes eleven ex-U.S.
patent applications, including applications in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates directed at
viral specific T cells, methods of treating and preventing viral infections, and methods for developing CD3+CD+ cells against
multiple viral epitopes for the treatment of viral infections, which have anticipated expiration dates through July 29,
2042. 

In
the United States, our three issued utility patents, all of which expire on December 9, 2040, are U.S. Patent No. 11,191,827 covering
methods of treating COVID-19 infection using COVID-19 peptide specific CTLs; U.S. Patent No. 11,207,401 covering COVID-19 peptide-specific
CTLs; and U.S. Patent No. 11,219,684 covering methods of manufacturing COVID-19 peptide specific CTLs. A pending utility patent application
in the United States directed at viral specific T cells and methods of treating and preventing viral infections has an anticipated expiration
of December 9, 2041. In addition, we have applied for registered trademark protection for Tevogen Bio (and design) as well
as ExacTcell and Tevogen AI with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 

We
determine strategy for patents claims scope for our applications on a case-by-case basis, taking into account advice of counsel
and our business model. We file patents containing claims for protection of useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any
product candidates, including new applications or uses we discover for existing technologies and product candidates, based on our assessment
of their strategic value. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as our pending and issued patent
claims, to ensure maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes and compositions, given existing patent office rules and
regulations. 

As
the aforementioned patents were developed internally, historical expenditures related to their development were all expensed as incurred
per U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We believe these patents have significant value as the basis
of our product pipeline. Our continued investment in our pipeline highlights our belief in future commercial viability of these products.

On
February 14, 2024 (the Closing Date ), pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated June 28, 2023 (the Merger
Agreement by and among Semper Paratus, Semper Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Semper Paratus Merger Sub ),
SSVK Associates, LLC, Tevogen Bio, and Dr. Ryan Saadi, in his capacity as seller representative, Merger Sub merged with and into Tevogen
Bio, with Tevogen Bio being the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Semper Paratus (the Merger, and together
with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination and Semper Paratus was renamed
Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc. (the Closing ). See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this quarterly
Report 10-Q for additional information regarding the net assets acquired through the Merger. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse
recapitalization under GAAP because the Company was determined to be the accounting acquirer. 

Since
commencing operations in June 2020, we have devoted substantially all our efforts and financial resources to establishing corporate governance,
recruiting essential staff, establishing research and development capability including securing laboratory space and equipment, conducting
scientific research, securing intellectual property rights to our inventions related to our product candidates and ExacTcell, carrying
out drug discovery including pre-clinical studies and our Phase 1 clinical trial of TVGN 489, raising capital, and pursuing the Business
Combination. 

To
date, we have not generated any revenue. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.9 million and 3.9
million, respectively. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 6.1 million loss from
operations. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.3 million and 56.8 million, respectively. Net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a loss from operations of 44.2 million that primarily
resulted from non-cash, stock-based compensation expense recognized with the liquidity event condition contained in certain stock awards
was satisfied upon the closing of the Business Combination as well as 7.5 million in transaction costs in connection with the Business
Combination, partially offset by the change in fair value of convertible promissory notes of 48.5 million. As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash of 2.3 million. 

On
February 14, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with The Patel Family, LLP (the Patel Family pursuant
to which the Patel Family purchased 500 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 2.0 million. On March
27, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement with the Patel Family pursuant to which we amended and
restated the original agreement and the Patel Family agreed to purchase 600 shares of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate
purchase price of 6.0 million, of which 3.0 million has been received through November 19, 2024. On August 21, 2024, we entered into
a securities purchase agreement with the Patel Family, pursuant to which the investor purchased 600 shares of our Series C Preferred
Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 6.0 million. 

As
described in more detail in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Funding Requirements below, on June 6, 2024, we entered
into a Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement with the Patel Family providing for (i) an unsecured line of credit facility
(the Facility ), pursuant to which the Patel Family agreed to lend us up to an initial amount of 36.0 million (the Maximum
Loan Amount of term loans in 1.0 million increments on a monthly basis, over a draw period of thirty-six months, and (ii) a
contingent option for the Patel Family to purchase at least 14.0 million of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common
Stock ), in a future private placement (the Optional PIPE ). The Loan Agreement also contains a contingent option
for the Patel Family to purchase at least 14.0 million of our Common Stock plus up to the then-remaining available amount under the
Facility, in a future private placement if the ten-day trailing volume weighted average price per share of the Common Stock (the Trailing
VWAP reaches 10.00 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company also issued to the Patel Family 1,000,000
shares of Common Stock as a commitment fee (the Commitment Shares ), subject to forfeiture by the Patel Family of the Commitment
Shares or an equal number of shares of Common Stock in the event the Patel Family fails to (i) make a deposit under the Facility when
due or (ii) pay the purchase price for the Optional PIPE within 30 days after the Threshold Price Notice Date (as defined in the Loan
Agreement) in the event the Company has satisfied all applicable closing conditions. 

Based
on cash on hand as of the date of this Report, the 2.0 million received from the sale of Series C Preferred Stock in October 2024, as
well as our Loan Agreement, we have concluded that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from
the issuance date of our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

We
do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval or other authorization for and successfully commercialize
TVGN 489 or another product candidate. We expect to incur expenses related to expanding our research and development capability, building
our manufacturing infrastructure including through acquisitions, and developing our commercialization organization, including reimbursement,
marketing, managed market, and distribution functions, and training and deploying a specialty medical science liaison team.

On
June 14, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq s Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff notifying us that
we no longer met the 1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement based on the closing bid price for our Common Stock for the previous 35 consecutive business days. The letter had no immediate effect
on the listing of our Common Stock and outstanding public warrants to purchase Common Stock, and we were provided an initial compliance
period of 180 calendar days from receipt of the letter, or until December 11, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.
On October 28, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff notifying us that we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.
The letter confirmed that, from October 14, 2024 through October 25, 2024, the closing bid price of our Common Stock had been 1.00 per
share or higher and, accordingly, we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and that the matter was closed.

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including staffing, discovery efforts, pre-clinical
studies, and clinical development of TVGN 489, and pre-clinical studies of other product candidates, and include: 

acquisition
 of supplies and equipment and leasing lab spaces; 

expenses
 incurred to conduct the necessary pre-clinical studies required by the U.S. Food and Drug
 Administration to obtain the regulatory approval necessary to conduct our TVGN 489 clinical
 trial; 

salaries,
 benefits, and other related costs for personnel engaged in research and development functions 

costs
 of funding research performed by third parties, including pursuant to agreements with contract
 research organizations CROs ), and investigative site costs to conduct our
 pre-clinical studies and clinical trials 

manufacturing
 costs, including expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations
 CMOs ), including manufacturing scale-up expenses, and the cost of acquiring
 and manufacturing pre-clinical study and clinical trial materials 

costs
 of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation, and related travel
 expenses 

costs
 of laboratory supplies and acquiring materials for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials 
 and 

facility-related
 expenses, which include direct depreciation costs of equipment and expenses for rent and
 maintenance of facilities and other operating costs. 

Research
and development activities are central to the biotechnology business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development
generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased study sizes, which also leads generally
to longer patient enrollment times in later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase over the
next several years as we increase manufacturing, shipping, and storage of clinical batches required for clinical trials, personnel costs,
including stock-based compensation, conduct planned clinical trials for TVGN 489 and other clinical and pre-clinical activities for other
product candidates, and prepare regulatory filings for any of our product candidates. 

The
successful development of our current or future product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or
know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidates. The success
of TVGN 489 and our other product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:

successfully
 initiating future clinical trials 

successfully
 enrolling patients in and completing clinical trials

 reimbursement by private and public payors including health technology appraisal entities
 in non-U.S. countries. 

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables concerning the development, manufacturing, or commercialization activities of a product
candidate could result in a change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if
we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate,
if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials
or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive, if there are safety concerns or if we determine that the observed safety or
efficacy profile would not be competitive in the marketplace, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources
and time on the completion of clinical development. We anticipate that product commercialization may take several years, and we expect
to spend a significant amount in development costs. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses, which include salaries, benefits, and stock-based long term incentive
compensation for employees. These expenses also encompass corporate facility costs such as rent, utilities, depreciation, and maintenance,
as well as costs not classified under research and development expenses. Legal fees pertaining to intellectual property and corporate
matters, as well as fees for accounting and consulting services, are also included in general and administrative expenses. 

We
expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities,
potential commercialization efforts, and increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include increased
costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers, accountants, and recruitment firms, among
other expenses. Increased costs associated with being a public company will also include expenses related to services associated with
maintaining compliance with SEC and Nasdaq Stock Market requirements, insurance, and investor relations costs. If any of our current
or future product candidates obtains marketing approval, we expect that we would incur significantly increased expenses associated with
sales and marketing efforts. 

Interest
Expense, Net 

Interest
expense, net consists primarily of interest on our convertible promissory notes and loan agreement, partially offset by interest earned
on bank deposits. (See Sources of Liquidity below). 

Merger
Transaction Costs 

Transaction
costs we incurred in relation to the Merger were initially capitalized as deferred transaction costs up through the Closing Date, at
which time such costs were charged to expense in our statements of operations less the amount of cash received in the Merger. 

Change
in Fair Value of Convertible Promissory Notes 

U.S.
accounting standards provide entities with an option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. As
a result of us electing this option, we recorded all convertible promissory notes at fair value with changes in fair value reported in
our statements of operations at each balance sheet date through the settlement of the convertible promissory notes in connection with
the Closing, at which time the convertible promissory notes were converted into our Common Stock. 

Change
in Fair Value of Written Call Option Derivative Liabilities 

Equity-linked
purchase options issued in connection with our debt agreements are assessed to determine whether they are freestanding or embedded with
the host instrument under ASC 815. Our embedded and freestanding purchase options were determined to be liability-classified derivative
instruments and are measured at fair value both on the date of issuance and at each subsequent balance sheet date, with changes in fair
value recorded to Change in fair value of written call option derivative liabilities within the consolidated statements
of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows. 

22 

Loss
on Issuance of Commitment Shares 

Our
other expenses consist of losses on the issuance of the Commitment Shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 associated
with the Loan Agreement. Since we intend to elect the fair value option for future draws under the Loan Agreement, we expense all issuance
costs associated with the Loan Agreement, which are comprised of the fair value of the Commitment Shares as well as the issuance date
fair value of the 14 million Purchase Option and Additional Amount Purchase Option. For more information about the Loan Agreement, see
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Requirements below.

services incurred as a result of the Merger. The 1.1 million in stock-based compensation was due to stock compensation
expense related to the RSUs granted to Dr. Saadi. 

23 

Interest
Expense, Net 

We
recognized 0.0 million and 0.3 million in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable primarily to the outstanding principal balance associated with
our convertible promissory notes which converted into Common Stock in connection with the Closing. 

Change
in Fair Value of Convertible Promissory Notes 

We
recognized a non-cash charge of 1.3 million for the change in fair value of the convertible promissory notes for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The change in fair value of the convertible promissory notes was primarily a result of the increase in the underlying
estimated fair value of our Common Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The convertible promissory notes were converted
into shares of Common Stock in connection with the Closing. 

Change
in Fair Value of Written Call Option Derivative Liabilities 

We
recognized a non-cash charge of 0.2 million for the fair value of our written call option derivative liabilities associated with our
Loan Agreement for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation due to a non-cash stock-based
compensation expense of 20.5 million recognized from certain stock-based awards that continue to vest through satisfaction of service
conditions subsequent to the satisfaction of the liquidity condition upon the Closing.

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 16.0 million compared to 3.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to stock-based compensation expense of 8.9 million, of which 6.7
million was recognized as a non-cash stock-based compensation expense from certain stock-based awards that continue to vest through satisfaction
of service conditions subsequent to the satisfaction of the liquidity condition upon the Closing, and 2.2 million was recognized as
restricted stock compensation expense related to the RSUs granted. The increase of 1.2 million in personnel costs was primarily attributable
to an increase in headcount and an increase in premium for the Company s director and officer insurance policy, and 0.8 million
was recognized as a loss from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock. The increase of 2.7 million in legal and professional fees was
primarily attributable to the additional services incurred as a result of the Merger. 

Interest
Expense, Net 

We
recognized 0.2 million and 0.9 million in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which
was attributable primarily to the outstanding principal balance associated with our convertible promissory notes that converted into
Common Stock in connection with the Closing. 

Merger
Transaction Costs 

Merger
transaction costs in excess of cash received from the Merger of 7.5 million were recognized as period expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. 

Change
in Fair Value of Convertible Promissory Notes 

We
recognized a non-cash gain of 48.5 million and a non-cash loss of 49.1 million for the change in fair value of the convertible promissory
notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily a result of the increase in the underlying
estimated fair value of our Common Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to a decrease in the underlying estimated
fair value of our Common Stock from January 1, 2024 to the settlement of the convertible promissory notes upon the Closing. 

Loss
on issuance of Commitment Shares 

We
incurred losses on the issuance of Commitment Shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, associated with the Loan Agreement. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 2.3 million in cash, as compared to 1.1 million in cash as of December 31, 2023. To date, we have not
yet commercialized any products or generated any revenue from product sales and have financed our operations primarily with proceeds
from the sale of convertible promissory notes and preferred stock, funds drawn on the Loan Agreement, and research tax credits. Since
January 2021, we have raised aggregate gross proceeds of 24.0 million from the sale of convertible promissory notes, 2.0 million from
the sale of our Series A Preferred Stock, 3.0 million from deposits related to the future sale of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock, and
 6.0 million from the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock. In June 2024, we entered into the Loan Agreement, which provided up to 36.0
million of term loans that can be drawn in 1.0 million increments each month over thirty-six months, as described below. As of September
30, 2024, we have drawn an aggregate of 1.0 million under the Loan Agreement.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 9.0 million of net cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities
reflected 9.7 million of net loss, non-cash charges related to the change in the fair value of the convertible promissory notes, stock-based
compensation expense, Merger transaction costs, loss on the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock, loss on issuance of the Commitment
Shares, depreciation expense, reductions in the operating right of use ROU assets, and non-cash interest on the convertible
promissory notes, partially offset by a 0.7 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities attributable to the timing of
our payments to our vendors for research and development activities. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 6.2 million of net cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities
reflected our net loss of 56.9 million offset by 49.1 million of non-cash charges related to the change in the fair value of the convertible
promissory notes, depreciation expense, and reductions in the operating ROU assets, offset by a 0.4 million net change in our operating
assets and liabilities attributable to the timing of our payments to our vendors for research and development activities. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased 0.1 million of property and equipment. There was no investing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 10.2 million of net cash from financing activities attributable to 2.0 million
in proceeds from the sale of Series A Preferred Stock, 4.0 million in proceeds from the sale of Series C Preferred Stock, 3.0 million
of non-refundable prepaid proceeds towards the anticipated issuance of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, 1.0 million drawn under the Loan
Agreement, and 0.2 million of cash in connection with the Merger. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 3.7 million of net cash from financing activities attributable to the proceeds
from the convertible promissory notes, partially offset by 0.2 million in payment of deferred transaction costs. 

Funding
Requirements 

Our
primary sources of funds to meet our near-term liquidity and capital requirements include cash on hand, including the funding we have
received from the sale of our Series A and Series C Preferred Stock and the funding we expect to receive from the sale of our Series
A-1 Preferred Stock, and our access to an unsecured line of credit (limited to a 1.0 million monthly draw) under the Loan Agreement
described below. On February 14, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor pursuant to which the investor
agreed to purchase shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 8.0 million. On March 27, 2024, we entered
into an agreement pursuant to which that amount was reduced to 2.0 million and the investor agreed to purchase shares of our Series
A-1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 6.0 million. We have not yet received 3.0 million of the 6.0 million purchase
price for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock. Even if we receive such proceeds, we will still need additional capital to fully implement
our business, operating, and development plans. On August 21, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor
pursuant to which the investor agreed to purchase shares of our Series C Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 6.0 million. 

26 

On
June 6, 2024, we entered into the Loan Agreement, pursuant to which the Lender agreed to provide to the Company up to the Maximum Loan
Amount of 36.0 million under the Facility. The Lender is also the investor in our Series A, Series A-1, and Series C Preferred Stock.
The Facility permits us to borrow up to 1.0 million monthly in a single monthly draw over a period of up to three years. Draws will
accrue interest at a fixed annual rate of the lower of (i) the daily secured overnight financing rate, measured on the date we receive
the draw (the Deposit Date ), plus 2.00 and (ii) 7.00 , accruing quarterly beginning on the Deposit Date and payable quarterly
beginning on the three-month anniversary of the Deposit Date. Interest will be payable in shares of Common Stock with an effective purchase
price of 1.50 per share, and each draw will mature 48 months after the Deposit Date. Prepayment will be permitted without penalty. The
Company may repay or prepay any amount of outstanding principal balance under the Facility at the Company s election in cash or
in shares of Common Stock with an effective purchase price of the greater of 1.50 per share and the 10-day trailing volume weighted
average price of the Common Stock (the Trailing VWAP as of the trading day prior to payment, subject to certain requirements
related to resale registration. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we also agreed to provide the Lender an option to purchase 14.0 million
of shares of our Common Stock plus an additional amount up to the total then-remaining available and undrawn portion of the Maximum Loan
Amount (which amount would thereafter no longer be available under the Facility). The Optional PIPE would be priced at a 30 discount
to the Trailing VWAP on the date such price first reaches at least 10.00 per share (the Threshold Price Date and will
be exercisable by the Lender by written notice within three business days after the Company has notified the Lender of the Threshold
Price Date (the date of such notice, the Threshold Price Notice Date ). Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, we
issued to the Lender the Commitment Shares, subject to forfeiture by the Lender of the Commitment Shares or an equal number of shares
of Common Stock in the event the Lender fails to (i) make a deposit under the Facility when due or (ii) pay the purchase price for the
Optional PIPE within 30 days after the Threshold Price Notice Date in the event the Company has satisfied all applicable closing conditions.
There is no assurance as to the amount of proceeds we will ultimately receive under the Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we
have drawn an aggregate of 1.0 million under the Loan Agreement 

We
expect to devote considerable financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we conduct our planned clinical
trials of TVGN 489 and other product candidates. 

Identifying
potential product candidates and conducting pre-clinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process
that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve
product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. 

We
expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our pre-clinical studies and clinical
trials. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for TVGN 489 in any indication or for any other product candidate we are developing
or develop in the future, we expect to incur commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution.
Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur increased costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need
additional funding to fully implement our business plans. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the
 progress, costs, and results of our planned clinical trials of TVGN 489 and other planned
 and future clinical trials 

the
 scope, progress, costs and results of our pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of TVGN
 489 for additional combinations, targets, and indications 

the
 number of and development requirements for additional indications for TVGN 489 or for any
 other product candidates 

our
 ability to scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support clinical trials
 of TVGN 489 and other product candidates we are developing and may develop in the future 

the
 costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of TVGN 489 and other product candidates
 we are developing and may develop in the future 

potential
 changes in the regulatory environment and enforcement rules 

our
 ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements
 and the financial terms of such arrangements 

the
 costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing,
 sales, marketing, and distribution, for TVGN 489 and other product candidates we are developing
 and may develop in the future for which we may receive marketing approval 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain acceptance of any approved products by patients, the medical
 community, and third-party payors 

the
 amount and timing of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of TVGN 489 and any
 other product candidates we are developing or develop in the future for which we receive
 marketing approval 

27 

potential
 changes in pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement infrastructure 

the
 availability of raw materials for use in production of our product candidates and 

the
 costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and
 enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and defending any intellectual
 property-related claims. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2.3 million. Our cash balance, the 2.0 million received from the sale of Series C Preferred Shares,
and the Loan Agreement, which allows us to draw down term loans of 1.0 million per month over thirty-six months, will allow us to have
adequate cash and financial resources, to operate for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our unaudited consolidated
financial statements included in this Report. 

We
regularly evaluate different strategies to obtain funding for operations for subsequent periods. These strategies may include but are
not limited to private placements of securities, licensing and/or marketing arrangements, partnerships with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology
companies, and public offerings of securities. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms and may not be able to enter
into strategic alliances or other arrangements on favorable terms. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the
rights of our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we could be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research
and development programs, product portfolio expansion, or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business
prospects.

The
commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant
terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the
actions under the contracts. Our contracts with CROs, CMOs, and other third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and
to support pre-clinical research studies and clinical testing are generally cancelable by us upon prior notice and do not contain any
minimum purchase commitments. Payments due upon cancellation consisting only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred,
including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation are not included in the table above as
the amount and timing of such payments are not known. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, the fair value of our Common
Stock, the fair value of our convertible promissory notes, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience,
known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, including those factors set out in the Risk
Factors section of our Annual Report. See also the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements 
above. 

While
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our financial statements contained in this Report and Note
3 to the audited financial statements included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the
most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements or involve a significant level of estimation
uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation. 

28 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development activities are expensed as incurred. As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to
estimate our accrued research and development expenses, including those related to clinical trials and product candidate manufacturing.
This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services
that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services
when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Our service providers invoice us in arrears or require prepayments
for services performed, as well as on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued
expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically
confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research
and development expenses include fees paid to: 

vendors
 in connection with pre-clinical and clinical development activities; 

CROs
 in connection with clinical trials; and 

CMOs
 in connection with the process development and scale-up activities and the production of
 pre-clinical and clinical trial materials. 

Costs
for clinical trials and manufacturing activities are recognized based on an evaluation of our vendors progress towards completion
of specific tasks, using data such as participant enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to us by our vendors
regarding their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of individual contracts and payment timing
may differ significantly from the period in which the services were performed. We determine accrual estimates through reports from and
discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of studies, or the services
completed. Our estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date are based on the facts and circumstances known at the time.
Costs that are paid in advance of performance are deferred as a prepaid expense and amortized over the service period as the services
are provided. 

Although
we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing
of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that
are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued
research and development expenses. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure that we will not make changes to our estimates
in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

Awards
under our compensation plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718. Compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value
of the award and is recognized over the vesting period of the award. We use the straight-line method to record compensation expense of
awards with service-based vesting conditions. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur. We recognize share-based
compensation expense for awards with performance conditions when it is probable that the condition will be met, and the award will vest.
Prior to the Merger, we estimated the fair value of our Common Stock in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued
as Compensation . 

Estimating
the fair value of Common Stock 

Prior
to the Closing, we were required to estimate the fair value of shares of our Common Stock underlying our stock-based awards and in connection
with valuing our convertible promissory notes. Because our Common Stock was not publicly traded prior to February 15, 2024, the fair
value of our Common Stock prior to such date had been estimated on each grant date by our board of directors, with input from our management,
considering third-party valuations of our Common Stock. 

Our
board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to estimate the estimated fair value of our Common Stock, including: 

the
 estimated value of all classes of securities outstanding 

the
 anticipated capital structure that will directly impact the value of the currently outstanding
 securities 

our
 results of operations and financial position 

the
 status of our research and development efforts 

29 

the
 composition of, and changes to, our management team and board of directors 

the
 lack of liquidity of our Common Stock as a private company 

our
 stage of development and business strategy and the material risks related to our business
 and industry 

external
 market conditions affecting the life sciences and biotechnology industry sectors 

the
 likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders of our Common Stock, such as an
 initial public offering, or a sale of the company, given the prevailing market conditions 
 and 

the
 market value and volatility of comparable companies. 

Fair
Value Measurements 

Our
recurring fair value measurements primarily consist of the convertible promissory notes prior to the Merger, for which we elected the
fair value option, the freestanding 14 million purchase option under the Loan Agreement, and the bifurcated purchase option that is
embedded within the loan commitment under the Loan Agreement. 

We
used the Probability Weighted Expected Return Method PWERM valuation methodology to determine the fair value of the convertible
promissory notes prior to the Merger for all the periods presented. The PWERM is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair
value based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The value is based on the probability-weighted
present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available. The future value under each
outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at
an indication of value. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of convertible promissory notes include volatility,
discount rate, and probability of a future liquidity event. In February 2024, concurrent with the Merger, we converted our outstanding
convertible promissory notes into 10,337,419 shares of Common Stock. 

We
used a Monte Carlo Simulation MCS valuation methodology to determine the fair value of the freestanding 14 million purchase
option and embedded purchase option associated with the Loan Agreement at inception and as of September 30, 2024. The MCS methodology
simulates the Company s future stock price to estimate if and when the Trailing VWAP will reach 10.00 per share, and discounts
the resulting payoff back to each valuation date using a present value factor. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value
of these options include volatility and discount rate.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

The
Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information under
this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the
end of the period covered by this report due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d)
and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part
II Other Information 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

In
the ordinary conduct of our business, we may be subject from time to time to legal proceedings. We currently have no material legal proceedings
pending. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

An
investment in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks set forth in the Risk Factors 
section of our Annual Report, other information set forth in this Report, and the additional information in the other reports we file
with the SEC. If any of the risks contained in those reports occur, our business, results of operation, financial condition, and liquidity
could be harmed, the value of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

Except
as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Any
failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our Common Stock and our outstanding public
warrants to purchase Common Stock. 

Our
Common Stock and our outstanding public warrants to purchase Common Stock (our Warrants are listed on Nasdaq. We are required
to meet specified financial and other requirements in order to maintain such listing, including a requirement that the closing bid price
for our Common Stock remain above 1.00. 

On
June 14, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq s Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff notifying us that
we no longer met the 1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement based on the closing bid price for our Common Stock for the previous 35 consecutive business days. On October 28, 2024, we received a
notification letter from the Staff notifying us that from October 14, 2024 through October 25, 2024, the closing bid price of our Common
Stock had been 1.00 per share or higher and, accordingly, we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and that
the matter was closed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement
or other Nasdaq listing standards. 

If
we fail to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our securities. Such
a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our securities and would impair your ability to sell or purchase the
securities when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance
with listing requirements would allow our securities to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our
securities, or prevent future non-compliance with listing requirements in the future. Additionally, if our securities are not listed
on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system
for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than
if our securities were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities
unless a market can be established or sustained. 

We
have previously failed to timely file certain periodic reports with the SEC. Potential future delays in the filing of our reports with
the SEC pose significant risks to our business, and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We
did not timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended March 31, 2024, and missed the initial deadline for the filing of our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024.
While we are now current in our filing of periodic reports under the Exchange Act, there is no assurance that in the future our reporting
will always be timely. Our access to financing may be impaired by any untimely filing of our periodic reports. For example, we will not
be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a short-form registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely
filed all periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for a period of twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately
preceding the filing of such registration statement. In addition, in the event the filing of our periodic reporting is delayed in the
future, we may experience a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. 

Future
failures to timely file periodic reports with the SEC could subject us to enforcement action by the SEC and stockholder lawsuits, and
result in the delisting of our Common Stock and Warrants from Nasdaq, regulatory sanctions from the SEC, or breach of covenants in any
future credit facilities or of any preferred equity or debt securities that we may issue in the future, any of which could have a material
adverse impact on our operations, your investment in our Common Stock and Warrants, and our ability to register with the SEC public offerings
of our securities for our benefit or the benefit of our security holders. Additionally, any potential failure to timely file future periodic
reports could result in investors not receiving access to current or timely information regarding our business and operations with which
to make investment decisions.
