9a. controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2023, the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over
financial reporting has been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and
directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework, in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on that assessment
under those criteria, management has determined that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 

Attestation
Independent Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 

This
annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm
regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s
registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this
annual report on Form 10-K. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
