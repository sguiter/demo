Note 11 
 
 ' written notice, subject to certain conditions. Under the Capital Plan, each member is required to own capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement or an activity stock requirement. All stock that supports a member s activity stock requirement with the Bank is classified as Class B1 activity stock. Any additional amount of stock necessary for the total amount of Class B stock held to equal a member s minimum investment amount will be classified as Class B2 membership stock. Members purchase Class B2 membership stock to satisfy their membership stock requirement with the Bank. Stock held in excess of a member s minimum investment requirement is classified as Class B2 excess capital stock. See Note 12 Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for further information on our capital stock and MRCS. 
 
 Total regulatory capital ratio Leverage capital Leverage capital ratio Risk-based capital 
 
 Total regulatory capital and leverage capital includes MRCS but does not include AOCI. Under the FHFA regulation on capital classifications and critical capital levels for the FHLBs, we are adequately capitalized. 
 
 Additionally, an FHFA Advisory Bulletin sets forth guidance for each FHLB to maintain a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets. In accordance with this guidance, the FHFA considers the proportion of capital stock to assets, measured on a daily average basis at month end, when assessing each FHLB s capital management practices. 

Repurchase of Excess Capital Stock 
 
 Members may request repurchases of excess stock on any business day. Additionally, on a monthly basis, the Bank repurchases excess capital stock held by each member or former member that exceeds certain limits set by the Bank. All repurchases of excess capital stock, including any future monthly repurchases, will continue until otherwise announced, but remain subject to our regulatory requirements, certain financial and capital thresholds, and prudent business practices.

 Other FHLBs 
 
 From time to time, we may loan to, or borrow from, other FHLBs. These transactions are done at market terms that are no more favorable than the terms of comparable transactions with other counterparties. These transactions are overnight, maturing the following business day. 
 
 We have also, from time to time, assumed the outstanding consolidated obligations of another FHLB rather than issue new consolidated obligations. In connection with these transactions, the Bank becomes the primary obligor for the transferred debt. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank did not assume any debt from other FHLBs. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Bank did not assume any debt from other FHLBs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Bank assumed consolidated obligation discount notes with a par value of billion from the FHLB of Atlanta with a corresponding transfer of funds to the Bank from the FHLB of Atlanta. 
 
 In addition, we provide programmatic and operational support in our role as the administrator of the MPF Program on behalf of the other MPF Banks for which we receive a membership and volume-based administration fee. 
 
 Material transactions with other FHLBs are identified on the face of our condensed financial statements.

Executive Summary 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights 
 
 Advances outstanding decreased to 59.3 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 65.3 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to depository members experiencing lower funding needs on their balance sheets along with reduced loan demand which resulted in paydowns. 
 
 MPF Loans held in portfolio increased to 13.0 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.4 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to new acquisition volume that outpaced paydown activity. 
 
 Total investment securities increased to 29.6 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 26.4 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in investment in GSE mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries. 
 
 Total liquid assets increased to 23.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 14.5 billion at December 31, 2023. We intend to maintain a sufficient pool of liquidity to support anticipated member demand for advances and letters of credit. 
 
 Total assets increased to 125.8 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 118.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, with the change primarily attributable to an increase in our liquidity portfolio. 
 
 Letters of credit commitments increased to 15.5 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 12.6 billion at December 31, 2023, attributable to increased usage from our members for public unit deposits. 
 
 We recorded net income of 130 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 53 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was driven by decreased advance balances in 2024 and an increase in noninterest expense which was primarily driven by increased contributions to housing and community development initiatives. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, noninterest income (loss) was 20 million, an increase of 9 million when compared to a 11 million gain for the third quarter of 2023. Gains from trading securities and instruments held under the fair value option were the primary driver of this increase. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, noninterest expense was 114 million, an increase of 36 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased contributions of 49 million to housing and community development initiatives, compared to 17 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we remained in compliance with all of our regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 Summary and Outlook 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Dividends and Dividend Guidance 
 
 On October 22, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of 9.25 (annualized) for Class B1 activity stock and a dividend of 4.65 (annualized) for Class B2 membership stock based on preliminary financial results for the third quarter of 2024. The dividend for the third quarter of 2024 will be paid by crediting members accounts on November 15, 2024. The Bank pays a higher dividend per share on activity stock compared to membership stock to recognize members support of the cooperative through the use of our products. We expect to maintain at least a 9.25 (annualized) dividend for Class B1 activity stock for the fourth quarter of 2024 and at least an 8.50 (annualized) dividend for Class B1 activity stock for the first quarter of 2025 , based on current projections and assumptions regarding our financial condition. We are providing this information to assist members in planning their activity with us. Any future dividend payment remains subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors and may be impacted by further changes in financial or economic conditions, regulatory and statutory limitations, and any other relevant factors. 
 
 Delivering on Our Commitment to Housing and Community Development 
 
 The Bank has disbursed more than 30 million through its Downpayment Plus (DPP Program through the third quarter of 2024 to provide downpayment and closing cost assistance to over 3,000 homebuyers in partnership with 202 member financial institutions. The DPP Program will remain open through year-end. In October, the Bank announced that it awarded over 47

 Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago 
 (U.S. Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated) 

million in grants through its 2024 Affordable Housing Program (AHP) General Fund to support affordable housing projects and developments. 
 
 Additionally, the Bank offers Community Development, Housing and Small Business Advances at below market rates to help members fund affordable housing and economic development needs in their communities. Over 1.4 billion was funded in these advances through the third quarter of 2024 to support over 7,500 housing units and more than 7,000 jobs. 
 
 New in 2024, the Bank established the Community Impact Advance Pilot Program to provide 50 million in subsidies to discount the rate on advances up to 200 basis points. Over 250 million was funded in Community Impact Advances through the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Bank also announced initiatives to facilitate more equitable housing lending and sustainable homeownership, including: 
 
 The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Collateral Pilot Program which provides members with increased lendable value on their pledged collateral for up to a program total of 300 million of qualifying mortgage loans on LIHTC multi-family housing projects through August 2027. 
 The acceptance of mortgage collateral using Vantagescore 4.0 to promote mortgage lending to creditworthy homebuyers who have historically been left out of conventional credit models. 
 New MPF Conventional Housing Impact Pricing Grids to help support low and very low-income households through improved pricing for loans to borrowers with income at or below 80 of area median income (AMI). 
 Increased funding for its Community First Housing Counseling Resource Program to 3.5 million in 2024, partnering with the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA). The program supports housing counseling agencies in expanding their services to minority and low- and moderate-income homebuyers, and by extension, expanding the pipeline of purchase-ready homebuyers for members.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income is the difference between the amount we recognize into interest income on our interest-earning assets and the amount we recognize into interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. These amounts were determined in accordance with GAAP and were based on the underlying contractual interest rate terms of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the following items: 
 
 Amortization of premiums; 
 
 Accretion of discounts; 
 
 Hedge ineffectiveness, which represents the difference between changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized into either interest income or interest expense, whichever is appropriate. For cash flow hedges, recognition occurs only when amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Such recognition occurs when earnings are affected by the hedged item; 
 
 Net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges; 
 
 Amortization of fair value and cash flow closed hedge adjustments; 
 
 Advance and investment prepayment fees; and 
 
 MPF credit enhancement income payments. 
 
 The following table presents the increase or decrease in interest income and expense due to volume or rate variances. The calculation of these components includes the following considerations: 
 
 Average Balance: Average balances are calculated using daily balances. Amortized cost is used to compute the average balances for most of our financial instruments, including MPF Loans held in portfolio (including those that are on nonaccrual status) and available-for-sale debt securities. Fair value is used to compute average balances for our trading debt securities and financial instruments carried at fair value under the fair value option. 
 
 Total Interest: Total interest includes the net interest income components, as discussed above, applicable to our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 Yield/Rate: Effective yields/rates are based on total interest and average balances as defined above. Yields/rates are calculated on an annualized basis. The calculation of the yield on our available-for-sale securities does not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of AOCI. 
 
 The change in volume is calculated as the change in average balance multiplied by the current year yield. The change in rate is calculated as the change in yield multiplied by the prior year average balance. Any changes due to the combined volume/rate variance have been allocated to volume.

The following analysis and comparisons apply to the periods presented in the above table unless otherwise indicated. 
 
 Interest income from investment debt securities increased primarily due to increased volume. 
 
 Interest income from advances decreased primarily due to a decline in volume due to depository members experiencing lower funding needs on their balance sheets along with reduced loan demand which resulted in paydowns. To a lesser extent, advances maturing in 2023 with a former captive insurance company member also contributed to this decrease in interest income. 
 
 Interest income from MPF Loans held in portfolio increased primarily due to the higher mortgage rate environment increasing the yield earned on new loan originations in 2024 compared to 2023. Secondarily, new acquisition volume that outpaced paydown activity also contributed to this increase in interest income. 
 
 Interest income from overnight federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits decreased primarily due to a decline in volume. 
 
 Interest income from securities purchased under agreements to resell increased primarily due to increased volume. 
 
 Interest expense on our consolidated obligation discount notes decreased primarily due to a decline in volume. 
 
 Interest expense on our consolidated obligation bonds for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to a decline in volume in 2024 compared to 2023. In contrast, interest expense on our consolidated obligation bonds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to higher overall market interest rates and the maturity of low coupon-rate bonds in 2024 compared to 2023.

 MPF fees (including from other FHLBs) 
 
 A majority of MPF fees are from other FHLBs that pay us a fixed membership fee to participate in the MPF Program and a volume-based administration fee for us to provide services related to MPF Loans carried on their balance sheets. MPF fees also include income from other third party off-balance sheet MPF Loan products and other related administration fees. These administration and membership fees are designed to compensate us for the expenses we incur to administer the program. MPF fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were comparable to the comparable prior period in 2023. MPF fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the comparable prior period in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in volume in MPF Loans held in portfolio. 
 
 Other, net 
 
 Other, net includes fee income we earn from member standby letters of credit products.

 The following analysis and comparisons apply to the periods presented in the above table. 
 
 Compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to decreased employee headcount and decreases in severance and pension-related expenses. We had 481 employees as of September 30, 2024, compared to 498 employees as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Nonpayroll operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased as we continued our planned investment in information technology, specifically applications, infrastructure and resiliency. 
 
 Voluntary Community Investment contributions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to subsidies on advances we offer at below market rates to support the local economy and community revitalization efforts in members' communities. 
 
 As required by statute, we allocate 10 of income before assessments to fund affordable housing grants through the AHP General Fund and the DPP Programs (see Note 11 - Affordable Housing Program to the financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for further details.) Recognizing that additional funds would be beneficial in meeting community needs in affordable housing, as well as business and community development, the Bank plans to continue to commit at least 5 of prior year income before assessments to discretionary funds for this purpose. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, we have expensed 9 of prior year income before assessments to discretionary funds to support our communities. For more information on some of these voluntary contributions, see Executive Summary on page 37. 
 
 Federal Housing Finance Agency and Office of Finance expenses consist of our share of the funding for the FHFA, our regulator, and the Office of Finance, which manages the consolidated obligation debt issuances of the FHLBs. 
 
 As noted in Noninterest Income on page 41, we earn MPF fees from the MPF Program, a majority of which are from other FHLBs, but also include income from other third party investors. These fees are designed to compensate us for the expenses we incur to administer the program. Our expenses relating to the MPF fees earned are included in the relevant line items in the noninterest expense table shown above. The following table summarizes MPF related fees and expenses. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 MPF fees earned 9 9 27 25 Expenses related to MPF fees earned 8 9 25 26 
 
 Assessments 
 
 We record the AHP assessment expense at a rate of 10 of income before assessments, excluding interest expense on MRCS. See Note 11 - Affordable Housing Program to the financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for further details.

 The following analysis and comparisons apply to the periods presented in the above table. 
 
 Net unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale debt securities 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net unrealized loss on our AFS portfolio was primarily driven by spreads to swaps widening. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net unrealized gain on our AFS portfolio was primarily due to spreads to swaps tightening in 2024. As these securities approach maturity, we expect the net unrealized gains in our AOCI as of September 30, 2024 to reverse over the remaining life of these securities (since we expect to receive par value at maturity). 
 
 Net unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges 
 
 The net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges for 2024 was primarily driven by the movement in long term market interest rates. 
 
 Postretirement plans 
 
 The loss on postretirement plans for 2024 was primarily due to an actuarial adjustment resulting from a slight decrease in the discount rate used to calculate postretirement benefits. 

We did not recognize any instrument-specific credit risk in our Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Income as of September 30, 2024 due to our credit standing. For further details on the activity in our Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) see Note 12 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the condensed financial statements.

 The following is an analysis of the above table and comparisons apply to September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. 

Cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold, and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
 
 Amounts held in these typically overnight accounts will vary each day based on the following: 
 
 Interest rate spreads between federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and our debt; 
 Liquidity requirements; 
 Counterparties available; and 
 Collateral availability on securities purchased under agreements to resell. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we maintained a sufficient pool of liquidity to support anticipated member demand for advances and letters of credit. 
 
 Investment Debt Securities 
 
 Investment debt securities increased at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to year end 2023 with the change primarily attributable to an increase in investment in GSE mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries. 

Advances 
 
 Advance balances decreased at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to year end 2023. This was primarily attributable to depository members experiencing lower funding needs on their balance sheets along with reduced loan demand which resulted in paydowns. Advance balances will vary based primarily on member demand or need for wholesale funding and the underlying cost of the advance to the member. It is possible that member demand for our advances could decline in future periods should their funding needs change, or to the extent they elect alternative funding resources. In addition, as our remaining advances with our former captive insurance company member continue to mature, our total advance levels may decrease. For a discussion of risks relating to our former captive insurance company member see Risk Factors starting on page 21 in our 2023 Form 10-K. For details on our advances with our former captive insurance company member, see Note 6 - Advances .

MPF Loans Held in Portfolio, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 MPF Loans held in portfolio increased at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to year end 2023. This was primarily attributable to new acquisition volume that outpaced paydown activity. In addition to our MPF Loans held in portfolio, we have MPF off-balance sheet products, where we buy and concurrently resell MPF Loans to Fannie Mae or pool and securitize them into Ginnie Mae MBS.

Liquidity, Funding, Capital Resources 

Liquidity 
 
 For the period ending September 30, 2024, we maintained a liquidity position in accordance with FHFA regulations and guidance, which may be amended from time to time, and policies established by our Board of Directors. Based upon our excess liquidity position described below, we anticipate remaining in compliance with our current liquidity requirements. See Liquidity, Funding, Capital Resources on page 51 in our 2023 Form 10-K for a detailed description of our current liquidity requirements. We use different measures of liquidity as follows: 
 
 Overnight Liquidity Our policy requires us to maintain overnight liquid assets at least equal to 3.5 of total assets (or 4.4 billion as of September 30, 2024). As of September 30, 2024, our overnight liquidity was 28.3 billion or 22 of total assets, giving us an excess overnight liquidity of 23.9 billion. 
 
 Deposit Coverage To support our member deposits, FHFA regulations require us to have an amount equal to the current deposits received from our members invested in obligations of the U.S. Government, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, or advances with maturities not exceeding five years. As of September 30, 2024, we had excess liquidity of 55.9 billion to support member deposits. 
 
 Liquidity Reserves As discussed on page 51 in the Liquidity, Funding, Capital Resources section in our 2023 Form 10-K, the FHFA advisory bulletin on FHLB liquidity (the "Liquidity AB") requires that: (i) we hold positive cash flow assuming no access to the capital markets for a period of between ten to thirty calendar days and assuming renewal of all maturing advances, and (ii) we maintain liquidity reserves between one and 20 percent of our outstanding letter of credit commitments. 
 
 In an effort to satisfy our current liquidity requirements, we generally maintain increased balances in short-term or liquid investments. In addition, we target a minimum amount of positive cash flow for the next five calendar days at the beginning of each day. Depending on market conditions, the Liquidity AB may require the Bank to hold an additional amount of liquid assets, which could reduce the Bank s ability to invest in higher-yielding assets, and may in turn negatively impact net interest income. To the extent that the Bank adjusts pricing for its short-term advances and letters of credit, these products may become less competitive, which may adversely affect advance and capital stock levels as well as letters of credit levels. For additional discussion of how our liquidity requirements may impact our earnings, see Risk Factors on page 21 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 In addition, we fund certain shorter-term or overnight investments and advances with debt that has a maturity that extends beyond the maturities of the related investments or advances. The Liquidity AB provides guidance on maintaining appropriate funding gaps for three-month (-10 to -20 and one-year (-25 to -35 maturity horizons. Subject to market conditions, our cost of funding may increase if we are required to achieve the appropriate funding gap by using longer term funding, on which we generally pay higher interest than on our short-term funding. 
 
 We are sensitive to maintaining an appropriate liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and liabilities, and we measure and monitor the risk of refunding such assets as liabilities mature (refunding risk). In measuring the level of assets requiring refunding, we take into account their contractual maturities, as further described in the notes to the condensed financial statements. In addition, we make certain assumptions about their expected cash flows. These assumptions include: calls for assets with such features, projected prepayments and scheduled amortizations for our MPF Loans held in portfolio, MBS and ABS investments.

 Conditions in Financial Markets 
 
 After keeping the target federal funds rate unchanged at its July 2024 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut that rate 50 basis points to a range of 4.75-5.00 at its September 2024 meeting, which was the first rate cut since March 2020. Leading up to the September 2024 meeting, market participants expected a cut, given economic data that suggested some softening in the labor market and easing inflation, as well as commentary from FOMC Chairman Powell at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in August 2024 indicating a policy adjustment in the near term. One matter of debate among market participants was the size of the expected cut; and, for the first time since 2005, one member of the FOMC dissented, preferring instead only a 25 basis point cut at the September 2024 meeting. Market participants continue to anticipate further rate cuts in the future. Yields for U.S. Treasuries were lower for all points across the curve at the end of the third quarter 2024 relative to the prevailing yields at the end of the second quarter 2024. 
 
 After increasing 1.6 in the first quarter of 2024, U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose by 3.0 in the second quarter of 2024. According to the Department of Commerce, GDP growth in the second quarter primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment. The U.S. stock market gained during the third quarter 2024. The Dow Jones Industrial Average attained a record closing high at the end of September 2024 with the index ending the quarter at 42,330 points on September 30, 2024, versus 39,119 points on June 28, 2024. 
 
 We maintained ready access to funding throughout the third quarter of 2024.

The reasons for the changes in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and changes in allocation within investing activities are discussed below for the nine months ended September 30, unless otherwise stated. 
 
 The cash flows relating to our liquid assets fluctuate depending on the needs of our members, our investing strategy, the economic environment, and/or regulatory requirements. We maintain a sufficient pool of liquidity to support anticipated member demand for advances and letters of credit. 
 
 In 2024 and 2023, our net cash outflows from investment debt securities was primarily attributable to an increase in investment in GSE mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries. 
 
 In 2024, our net cash inflows for advances were attributable to depository members experiencing lower funding needs on their balance sheets along with reduced loan demand which resulted in paydowns. In 2023, our net cash outflows for advances were attributable to increased borrowing from our depository members. 
 
 In 2024 and 2023, our net cash outflows for MPF Loans held in portfolio were due to new acquisition volume that outpaced paydown activity.

 Our financing activities primarily reflect cash flows related to issuing and repaying consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes. The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities and change in funding allocations are discussed below for the nine months ended September 30, unless otherwise stated. 
 
 In 2024, bonds matured or were called without being replaced. The increased borrowing on our discount notes reflects an increase in debt financing to match the overall increase in assets outstanding as discussed in investing activities above. In 2023, we paid down our discount notes and increased our use of bonds to align with advantageous funding opportunities. The increased borrowing on our bonds reflects an increase in debt financing to match the overall increase in assets (primarily advances) outstanding as discussed in investing activities above. 
 
 In 2024, we had no discount note transfers. In the second quarter of 2023, we assumed consolidated obligation discount notes from another FHLB due to an advantageous funding opportunity. 
 
 In 2024, our net cash inflows for Other was primarily due to proceeds from issuance of our capital stock and cash from deposits. In 2023, our net cash inflows for Other were primarily due to proceeds from issuance of our capital stock. 

Capital Resources 
 
 Capital Rules 
 
 Under our amended and restated Capital Plan, effective May 3, 2021 (the Capital Plan), our stock consists of two sub-classes of stock, Class B1 stock and Class B2 stock (together, Class B stock), both with a par value of 100 per share and redeemable on five years' written notice, subject to certain conditions. Under the Capital Plan, each member is required to own capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement or an activity stock requirement. All stock that supports a member s activity stock requirement with the Bank is classified as Class B1 activity stock. Any additional amount of stock necessary for the total amount of Class B stock held to equal a member s minimum investment amount will be classified as Class B2 membership stock. Members purchase Class B2 membership stock to satisfy their membership stock requirement with the Bank. Stock held in excess of a member s minimum investment requirement is classified as Class B2 excess capital stock. Any dividend declared on Class B1 activity stock must be greater than or equal to the dividend on Class B2 membership stock for the same period. The higher dividend paid on Class B1 activity stock since late 2013 acknowledges that members, through their utilization of Bank products, provide support to the entire cooperative. 
 
 Under the Capital Plan, each member s activity stock requirement is set at 4.5 for advances other than those borrowed under RCAP as further discussed below. The Capital Plan provides that the Board of Directors may periodically adjust members' activity stock requirement for advances between a range of 2 and 5 of a member's outstanding advances. 
 
 Additionally, for MPF on-balance sheet products (which includes MPF Original, MPF 125, MPF 35, and MPF Government loans), the activity stock requirement is 2 of the principal loan amount sold into master commitments opened or amended. Under the Capital Plan, the range within which our Board may adjust this requirement is between 0 and 5 . For letters of credit, the activity stock requirement is 0.10 of the notional amount of all new letters of credit issued, and all existing letters of credit renewed, extended or increased. Under the Capital Plan, the range for the letter of credit activity stock requirement is 0.10 to 2 . 
 
 Under the Capital Plan, each member s membership stock requirement is the greater of either 10,000 or 0.40 of a member's mortgage assets. The Capital Plan provides that the Board may periodically adjust members membership stock requirement between a range of 0.20 to 1 of a member s mortgage assets. A member s investment in membership stock is capped at 5 million, subject to adjustment by the Board within a range between 1 million and 25 million.

Table of Contents 
 Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago 
 (U.S. Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated) 

Membership stock requirements are recalculated annually, whereas the activity stock requirement and any automatic conversion of Class B2 membership stock to Class B1 activity stock related to activity continue to apply on a daily basis. 
 
 We may only redeem or repurchase capital stock from a member if, following the redemption or repurchase, the member continues to meet its minimum investment requirement and we remain in compliance with our regulatory capital requirements as discussed in Note 11 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the condensed financial statements. Members that withdraw from membership must wait at least five years after their membership was terminated and all of their capital stock was redeemed or repurchased before being readmitted to membership in any FHLB. 
 
 For details on our capital stock requirements under our capital plan for year-end 2023, see Capital Resources on page 58 in our 2023 Form 10-K. Under the terms of our Capital Plan, our Board of Directors is authorized to amend the Capital Plan, and the FHFA must approve all such amendments before they become effective. 
 
 For details on our minimum regulatory capital requirements see Note 11 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the condensed financial statements in this Form 10-Q , and Minimum Capital Requirements in Note 12 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Reduced Capitalization Advance Program 
 
 RCAP allows members to borrow one or more advances with an activity stock requirement of only 2 for the life of the advance instead of the current 4.5 requirement under our Capital Plan s general provisions. At September 30, 2024, RCAP advances outstanding totaled 13.0 billion to 82 members and former members. We may implement future programs for advances with a reduced activity stock requirement that may or may not have the same characteristics as current RCAP offerings. 
 
 Repurchase of Excess Capital Stock 
 
 Members may request repurchase of excess capital stock on any business day. Additionally, on a monthly basis, the Bank will repurchase excess capital stock held by each member or former member that exceeds certain thresholds set by the Bank. All repurchases of excess capital stock, including any future monthly repurchases, will continue until otherwise announced, but remain subject to our regulatory requirements, certain financial and capital thresholds, and prudent business practices. For details on the financial and capital thresholds relating to repurchases, see Repurchase of Excess Capital Stock on page 61 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Capital Amounts 
 
 The following table reconciles our capital reported in our Condensed Statements of Condition to the amount of capital stock reported for regulatory purposes. MRCS is included in the calculation of the regulatory capital and leverage ratios but is recorded in liabilities in our Condensed Statements of Condition . 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Capital stock 3,165 3,277 Mandatorily redeemable capital stock (MRCS) recorded as a liability 83 83 Regulatory capital stock 3,248 3,360 Retained earnings 5,232 4,979 Regulatory capital 8,480 8,339 Capital stock 3,165 3,277 Retained earnings 5,232 4,979 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 49 (116) GAAP capital 8,446 8,140 
 
 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the above table consists of changes in market value of various balance sheet accounts where the change is not recorded in earnings but is instead recorded in equity capital as the income (loss) is not yet realized. For details on these changes please see Note 12 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the condensed financial statements.

We may not pay dividends if we fail to satisfy our minimum capital and/or liquidity requirements under the FHLB Act and FHFA regulations. On October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a 9.25 dividend (annualized) for Class B1 activity stock and a 4.65 dividend (annualized) for Class B2 membership stock based on our preliminary financial results for the third quarter of 2024. This dividend totaled 73 million (recorded as 71 million dividends on capital stock and 2 million interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock) and is scheduled for payment on November 15, 2024. 
 
 Although we continue to work to maintain our financial strength to support a reasonable dividend, any future dividend payment remains subject to declaration by our Board and will depend on future operating results, our Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy and any other factors the Board determines to be relevant. For further information on our Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy , see page 62 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 We continue to allocate 20 of our net income each quarter to a restricted retained earnings account in accordance with the Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement that we entered into with the other FHLBs, as further discussed in Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement in Note 11 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Additionally, an FHFA Advisory Bulletin sets forth guidance for each FHLB to maintain a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets. In accordance with this guidance, the FHFA considers the proportion of capital stock to assets, measured on a daily average basis at month end, when assessing each FHLB s capital management practices.

Credit Risk Management 

Managing Our Credit Risk Exposure Related to Member Credit Products 
 
 Our credit risk rating system focuses primarily on our members' overall financial health and takes into account the member's asset quality, earnings, and capital position. For further information, please see Credit Risk Management starting on page 64 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 The following table presents the number of members and related credit outstanding to them by credit risk rating. Credit outstanding consists primarily of outstanding advances and letters of credit. MPF credit enhancement obligations, member derivative exposures, and other obligations make up the rest. Of the total credit outstanding, 59.6 billion were advances (par value) and 15.5 billion were letters of credit at September 30, 2024, compared to 66.0 billion and 12.6 billion at December 31, 2023.

 Members assigned a 4 rating in the above table were required to submit specific collateral listings and the members assigned a 5 rating were required to deliver collateral to us or to a third party custodian on our behalf. 

MPF Loans and Related Exposures 
 
 For details on our allowance for credit losses on MPF Loans, please see Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses to the condensed financial statements. 
 
 Credit Risk Exposure - Our credit risk exposure on conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio is the potential for financial loss due to borrower default and depreciation in the value of the real estate collateral securing the MPF Loan, offset by the borrower's equity, which represents the fair value of the underlying property in excess of the outstanding MPF Loan held in portfolio balance, our ability to recover losses from primary mortgage insurance, Recoverable CE Income, and the CE Amount which may include SMI. The PFI is required to pledge collateral to secure any portion of its CE Amount that is a direct obligation of the PFI. For further details see Loss Structure for Credit Risk Sharing Products on page 9 in our 2023 Form 10-K, and Credit Risk Exposure and Setting Credit Enhancement Levels starting on page 67 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Mortgage Repurchase Risk 
 
 We are exposed to mortgage repurchase risk in connection with our sale of MPF Loans to Fannie Mae under the MPF Xtra product and to Ginnie Mae for MPF Loans securitized in Ginnie Mae MBS if a loan eligibility requirement or other representation or warranty is breached. We may require the PFI from which we purchased the ineligible MPF Loan to repurchase that loan from us or to indemnify us for related losses, or request indemnification from the PFI s MPF Bank. Of these two products, our MPF Xtra product is the more popular, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we purchased and concurrently delivered 0.5 billion and 0.5 billion in unpaid principal balance of these loans to Fannie Mae. 
 
 For additional details on our mortgage repurchase risk in connection with our sale of MPF Loans to third party investors and MPF Loans securitized into MBS when a loan eligibility requirement or other warranty is breached, see Mortgage Repurchase Risk on page 69 in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Investment Debt Securities 
 
 We hold a variety of investment debt securities, mostly government backed or insured securities. There have been no material changes in the credit ratings of these securities since December 31, 2023 except for our FFELP ABS portfolio, which was downgraded in the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have a remaining balance of 1.14 billion in FFELP ABS downgraded from AA to A, and 262 million in FFELP ABS downgraded from AA to BBB. We believe these investments are currently low risk. For further details see Investment Debt Securities on page 71 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Unsecured Short-Term Investments 
 
 See Unsecured Short-Term Investments on page 73 in our 2023 Form 10-K for further details on our unsecured short-term investments as well as policies and procedures to limit and monitor our unsecured credit risk exposure. 
 
 The following table presents the credit ratings of our unsecured investment counterparties, organized by the domicile of the counterparty or, where the counterparty is a U.S. branch or agency office of a foreign commercial bank, by the domicile of the counterparty's parent. This table does not reflect the foreign sovereign government's credit rating. The ratings shown in the following table reflect the lowest long-term debt rating reported among the three largest Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs). FHFA regulations require the Bank to develop and assign internal credit ratings for its counterparties that do not rely exclusively on ratings reported by NRSROs. As such, the ratings shown in the following table are for presentation purposes only. The unsecured investment credit exposure presented in the table may not reflect the average or maximum exposure during the period as the table reflects only the balances at period end .

Managing Our Credit Risk Exposure Related to Derivative Agreements 
 
 See Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities to the condensed financial statements for a discussion of how we manage our credit risk exposure related to derivative agreements. We have credit exposure on net asset positions where we have not received adequate collateral from our counterparties. We also have credit exposure on net liability positions where we have pledged collateral in excess of our liability to a counterparty. 
 
 The following table presents our derivative positions where we have such credit exposures. The ratings shown in the following table reflect the lowest long-term debt rating reported among the three largest NRSROs. FHFA regulations require the Bank to develop and assign internal credit ratings for its counterparties that do not rely exclusively on ratings reported by NRSROs. As such, the ratings shown in the following table are for presentation purposes only. Noncash collateral pledged consists of initial margin we posted through our FCMs, on behalf of the DCOs for cleared derivatives and is included in our derivative positions with credit exposure. Noncash collateral pledged also consists of net initial margin exchanged on our bilateral derivatives, which for presentation purposes we have reported on a net basis. As of September 30, 2024, we had no material concentration of credit risk with any one bilateral derivative counterparty.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 
 Significant regulatory actions and developments are summarized below. 
 
 FHFA's Review and Analysis of the FHLB System. On November 7, 2023, the FHFA issued a written report titled FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future, (System at 100 Report) presenting its review and analysis of the FHLB System and the actions and recommendations that it plans to pursue in service of its vision for the future of the FHLB System. The report focused on four broad themes: (1) the mission of the FHLB System; (2) the FHLB System as a stable and reliable source of liquidity; (3) housing and community development; and (4) FHLB System operational efficiency, structure, and governance. The FHFA has stated that it expects to continue a multi-year collaborative effort with the FHLBs, their member institutions, and other stakeholders to address the recommended actions in the System at 100 Report and has stated that it can implement some of the recommendations from the report through ongoing supervision, guidance, or rulemaking, as well as through statutory changes by proposing specific requests for Congressional action. The FHFA made legislative recommendations for the FHLB System in its 2023 Report to Congress issued on June 14, 2024 consistent with proposed plans and actions included in the System at 100 Report. Other significant recent regulatory actions for the FHLBs are discussed in this section. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on FHLB Member Credit Risk Management (AB 2024-03). On September 27, 2024, the FHFA issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the FHFA s expectations that an FHLB s underwriting and credit decisions should reflect a member s financial condition and not rely solely on the collateral securing the member s credit obligations. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBs to implement policies for credit risk governance, member credit assessment and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of: escalation policies; processes for coordination with members prudential regulators; and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. While the Bank is still evaluating this advisory bulletin against its current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess its potential impact on the Bank and its operations, the Bank does not expect this guidance will impact its role as a reliable source of liquidity for its members. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on Federal Home Loan Bank System Climate-Related Risk Management (AB 2024- 04). On September 30, 2024, the FHFA issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the FHFA s expectation that each FHLB should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework over time. The advisory bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate, monitor and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the board of directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBs to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. Some aspects of this advisory bulletin also apply to the Office of Finance, as relevant. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the advisory bulletin on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for Federal Home Loan Banks. On October 3, 2024, the FHFA published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024, to amend the FHFA s regulation on capital requirements Capital Regulation to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBs. The proposed rule would include interest bearing deposit accounts IBDAs in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits in approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations and clarify that certain non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment or other transactional accounts) are to be considered unsecured extensions of credit subject to the Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general unsecured credit limit could provide greater flexibility for an FHLB s liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to the Bank s current business processes. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Federal Home Loan Bank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management . On November 4, 2024, the FHFA published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of February 3, 2025, revising its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBs and the OF. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (1) impact director compensation by allowing the Director of the FHFA to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (2) require the FHLBs to complete and submit background checks to the FHFA on every nominee for a directorship; (3) impact public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (4) expand the list of qualifying experiences for all FHLB independent directors to

include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, Community Development Financial Institutions, business models, and modeling; and (5) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing FHLB directors for cause. Other proposed revisions address, among other things, FHLB conflicts of interest policies, covering all FHLB employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management and record retention. 
 
 While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practice, several of the proposed revisions could result in significant changes to the nomination, election and retention of the Bank s board of directors. Additional director eligibility requirements and limitations on, and potential reductions or limitations to, director compensation resulting from the proposed rule, if adopted, could hinder the Bank s ability to recruit and retain directors with the talent and expertise that are critical to the Bank s ability to satisfy its mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. The Bank continues to analyze the impact that the proposed rule could have on us. 
 
 The Bank continues to monitor the FHFA s efforts to implement the recommendations from the System at 100 Report and the Bank is not able to predict what actions will ultimately result, the timing or extent of any actions or changes, or the ultimate effect on the Bank, its members, or the FHLB System in the future. The Bank plans to continue to engage with the FHFA and other stakeholders in an effort to ensure that the FHLB System remains well positioned to serve the Bank s members and their communities. For a further discussion of the System at 100 Report, including proposed plans and actions, and related risks, see the Legislative and Regulatory Developments and Risk Factors sections of our 2023 Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Our Asset/Liability Management Committee and its subcommittees provide oversight of our risk management practices and policies. This includes routine reporting to senior Bank management and the Board of Directors, as well as maintaining the Income and Market Value Risk Policy, which defines our interest rate risk limits. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk on page 75 in our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion on market risk. 
 
 The table below reflects the expected change in market value of equity for the stated increase or decrease in interest rates based on our models and related loss limit for each scenario established in the policy. For our down scenario shock analysis, the down shocks are constrained by scenarios provided by our regulator, which currently are limited so that shocked rates will not go negative but are subject to change. As a result, where applicable, we apply a floor to the down shock scenario at 10 bps. In the current rate environment, this floor setting was not triggered for any of the shock scenarios presented below. 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Scenario as of Change in Market Value of Equity Loss Limit Change in Market Value of Equity Loss Limit -200 bp (17) (650) (112) (650) -100 bp 19 (290) (30) (290) -50 bp 18 (130) (8) (130) -25 bp 11 (65) (2) (65) +25 bp (14) (65) (2) (65) +50 bp (32) (130) (7) (130) +100 bp (75) (290) (26) (290) +200 bp (192) (650) (86) (650) 
 
 Measurement of Market Risk Exposure 
 
 To measure our exposure, we discount the cash flows generated from modeling the terms and conditions of all interest rate-sensitive securities using current interest rates to determine their fair values or spreads to the swap curve for securities where third party prices are used. This includes considering explicit and embedded options using a lattice model or Monte Carlo simulation. We estimate yield curve, option, and basis risk exposures by calculating the fair value change in relation to various parallel changes in interest rates, implied volatility, prepayment speeds, spreads to the swap curve and mortgage rates. 
 
 The table below summarizes our sensitivity to various interest rate risk exposures in terms of changes in market value. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Yield Curve Risk 5 8 Option Risk Implied Volatility (5) (5) Basis Risk Spread to Swap Curve (10) (3) 
 
 Yield curve risk Change in market value for a one basis point parallel increase in the swap curve. 
 Option risk (implied volatility) Change in market value for a one percent parallel increase in the swaption volatility. 
 Option risk (prepayment speeds) Change in market value for a one percent increase in prepayment speeds. 
 Basis risk (spread to swap curve) Change in market value for a one basis point parallel increase in the spread to the swap curve. 
 Basis risk (mortgage spread) Change in market value for a one basis point increase in mortgage rates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our sensitivity to changes in implied volatility using a lattice model and Monte Carlo simulation was (5) million, compared to (5) million at December 31, 2023. These sensitivities are limited in that they do not incorporate other risks, including but not limited to non-parallel changes in yield curves, prepayment speeds, and basis risk related to differences between the swap and the other curves. Option positions embedded in our mortgage assets and callable debt impact our yield curve risk profile, such that swap curve changes significantly greater than one basis point cannot be linearly interpolated from the table above.

 (U.S. Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated) 

Duration of equity is another measure to express interest rate sensitivity. We report the results of our duration of equity calculations to the FHFA each quarter. We measure duration of equity in a base case using the actual yield curve as of a specified date and then shock it with an instantaneous shift of the entire curve. 
 
 The following table presents the duration of equity reported by us to the FHFA in accordance with the FHFA's guidance, which prescribes that down and up interest-rate shocks equal 200 basis points. The results are shown by duration of equity in years. The Bank engages in ongoing performance monitoring for its market risk-related models. 
 
 Duration of equity in years Scenario as of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Down 200 bps -0.5 -1.1 Base 0.5 0.0 Up 200 bps 1.4 0.7 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, on a U.S. GAAP basis, our fair value surplus (relative to book value) was 297 million, and our market value of equity to book value of equity ratio was 104 , compared to 390 million and 105 at December 31, 2023. The decline in the market value of equity to book value of equity was largely a result of fixed income instruments approaching par value and consolidated obligation spread tightening in the markets. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that information relating to us that is required to be disclosed in reports filed with the SEC: (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 For the most recent quarter presented in this Form 10-Q, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Consolidated Obligations 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures for accumulating and communicating information relating to our joint and several liability for the consolidated obligations of other FHLBs. For further information, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures on page 83 in our 2023 Form 10-K.
