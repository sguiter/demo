 and at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was reported in accrued interest receivable on the balance sheets. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance as earned using the interest method over the life of the loan. Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the related loan s yield using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due, is not well collateralized and in the process of collection, or when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the principal or interest will not be collectible in the normal course of business. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. A loan is considered to be past due when a scheduled payment has not been received 30 days after the contractual due date. All accrued interest is reversed against interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest received on such loans is accounted for using the cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, there is a sustained period of repayment performance, and future payments are reasonably assured.

 of the loan and remits of the loan balance to the seller and the seller establishes a reserve deposit account with the Bank equal to of the loan balance. If a loan becomes delinquent, the Bank withdraws payment from the reserve deposit account. If a loan becomes delinquent, the seller typically replaces the delinquent loan with a performing loan of equal or greater balance (although this is not a contractual obligation of the seller). The performance of these loans may be adversely affected by among other factors, local and national market conditions, the interest rate environment and inflation. Consumer Loans This category consists of loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal use. The performance of these loans may be adversely affected by national and local economic conditions, inflation, and other factors affecting the borrower s income available to service the debt. 
 Additionally, the allowance for credit losses calculation includes subjective adjustments for qualitative risk factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical experience. These qualitative adjustments may increase or reduce reserve levels and include adjustments for lending management experience and risk tolerance, loan review and audit results, asset quality and portfolio trends, loan portfolio growth, industry concentrations, trends in underlying collateral, external factors, and economic conditions not already captured. The Company estimates reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected credit losses and reverts to historical loss information for periods beyond the forecast period for the remaining life of the loan pool. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided through the operation or sale of the collateral, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for estimated selling costs, as appropriate.

 Credit Quality Indicators The Company uses the following criteria to assess risk ratings with respect to its loan portfolio, which are consistent with regulatory guidelines: Pass - Loans that comply in all material respects with the loan policies that are adequately secured with conforming collateral and that are extended to borrowers with documented ability to safely cover their total debt service requirements. Special Mention - Includes loans that do not warrant adverse classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses that deserve close attention. Substandard - Includes loans that are inadequately protected by the collateral pledged or the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower. Such loans have one or more weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and expose the Company to loss if the weaknesses are not corrected. The Company s credit quality indicators are reviewed and updated annually.

 Collateral-Dependent Loans The Company designates individually evaluated loans on nonaccrual status as collateral-dependent loans, as well as other loans that management of the Company designates as having higher risk. Collateral-dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. These loans do not share common risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the allowance for credit losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the Company has adopted the practical expedient to measure the allowance for credit losses based on the fair value of collateral. The allowance for credit losses is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan s collateral, which is adjusted for liquidation costs/discounts, and amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost, no allowance is required.

 Allowance for Credit Losses The decrease in the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was driven by various factors, including the evolving economic outlook, values in the local real estate market, low net charge-offs, and refining our peer group selection to better align with peers whose loan portfolios reflect the composition of our own loan portfolio and the current local economic conditions. Adjusting this component of our estimate has resulted in a reduced peer group loss rate and corresponding adjustments to our peer comparisons. This change in accounting estimate was recognized prospectively. In turn our CECL reserve percentage was decreased resulting in a million reversal in our allowance for credit loss. This adjustment was made in the second quarter of 2024.

 Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted.

 The Company did t record any liabilities at fair market value for which measurement of the fair value was made on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There were transfers into, out of, purchases, or sales of Level 3 securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis The following describes the hierarchy designation, valuation methodologies, and key inputs for those assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis: Collateral Dependent Loans For collateral dependent loans, fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified at a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral dependent loans consist of one-to-four family mortgages secured by residential properties. The value of residential property collateral is determined based on appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Company. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Foreclosed Assets and Real Estate Owned Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired and classified at a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These assets are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.

 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Fair value estimates may not be realizable in an immediate settlement of the instrument. In some instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments, in which case fair values may be based on estimates using the present value or other valuation techniques, or based on judgements regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of financial instruments, or other factors. Those techniques are significantly affected by assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. Subsequent changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Management s discussion and analysis is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The financial information in this section is derived from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. You should read the financial information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information contained in this report and in the Company s definitive prospectus dated May 10, 2024, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 20, 2024. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, continue, target and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market area, which are worse than expected; inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of our financial instruments, or our loan origination volume, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments within our loan portfolio; changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; our ability to access cost-effective funding; our ability to maintain adequate liquidity, primarily through deposits; fluctuations in real estate values and in the conditions of the residential real estate market; demand for loans and deposits in our market area; our ability to implement and change our business strategies;

 competition among depository and other financial institutions; adverse changes in the securities markets; changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums; changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; a failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks; our ability to manage market risk, credit risk, operational risk and reputation risk; our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; our ability to retain key employees; and changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 
 Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company assumes no obligation and disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policy discussed below to be our critical accounting policy. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act) contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

 We consider the accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses to be our critical accounting policy. Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology. Under the CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of lifetime credit losses in loans as of the balance sheet date using relevant available information, from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For reporting periods before January 1, 2023 and the adoption of CECL, we used the incurred loss impairment method to estimate the allowance for loan losses on loans receivable. Under the incurred loss impairment methodology, the allowance for loan losses was based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, and other factors, and consisted of allocated and unallocated components. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to our allowance for credit losses that existed as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We concluded that our procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023 and un-remediated as of September 30, 2024. Specifically, we identified, the following material weaknesses in our internal control over our financial reporting: management did not maintain sufficient evidence of independent review or supporting documentation related to key methodologies, assumptions, and calculations, including support for the qualitative factors, utilized in the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; and management did not maintain sufficient evidence of independent review or supporting documentation, including support for the qualitative factors, related to the January 1, 2023 adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses. 
 These material weaknesses could result in misstatements of our allowance for credit losses and related disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. We intend to remediate these material weaknesses. We currently are assessing and improving our processes and control procedures to ensure they will operate at an acceptable level of assurance. The remedial measures we will take to address these material weaknesses include calculating an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments; revising the peer group of institutions to include institutions whose loan portfolios better reflect the composition of our loan portfolio; obtaining updated independent appraisals for loans being evaluated for impairment; enhancing qualitative factors support to include data points tied to a specified timeframe, such as, for example, the unemployment rate, to consistently allocate basis point reserves for each reporting period; using qualitative factors to adjust the allowance for credit losses for economic conditions that impact us and documenting the adjustments in a narrative accompanying the allowance calculation; and assigning an independent individual to review the allowance calculation to assure its accuracy and completeness. We believe these actions and any other that we may determine need to be implemented, when complete, will remediate the control weaknesses. However, the weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time for management to test the results for operating effectiveness. Once implemented, we intend to continue periodic testing and reporting of the internal controls to ensure continuity of compliance. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was driven by various factors, including the evolving economic outlook, values in the local real estate market, low net charge-offs, and refining our peer group selection to better align with peers whose loan portfolios reflect the composition of our own loan portfolio and the current local economic conditions. Adjusting this component of our estimate has

 resulted in a reduced peer group loss rate and corresponding adjustments to our peer comparisons. In turn our CECL reserve percentage was decreased resulting in a 1.1 million reversal in our allowance for credit loss. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Total Assets. Total assets were 523.8 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 43.0 million, or 9.0 , compared to 480.8 million at December 31, 2023.

 Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased by 1.0 million, or 25.0 , to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is attributed to a 252,000, or 7.0 , increase in interest on loans, a 433,000, or 346.4 , increase in interest on other interest-earning assets and 353,000, or 84.3 , increase in interest on investment securities available-for-sale. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average loans receivable, net, increased by 6.9 million, or 1.9 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on loans increased to 4.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.96 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the rising market rate environment. The average balance of investment securities available-for-sale increased 13.4 million, or 19.4 , to 82.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 69.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on available-for-sale investment securities increased to 3.71 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.40 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average yield on available-for-sale investment securities was primarily due to the rising market interest rate environment. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents, comprised primarily of overnight deposits, increased by 433,000, or 376.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to an increase in the average yield to 5.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.80 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was mainly due to the increase in the balance of cash and cash equivalents arising from the cash received for the purchase of stock in the IPO. The increase in average yield was due to the rise in market interest rates. Interest Expense . Total interest expense increased 508,000 or 28.2 , to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the average cost of deposits to 2.27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the rising market interest rate environment. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by 18.7 million, or 4.9 , to 403.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 384.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net Interest Income . Net interest income increased 530,000, or 22.5 , to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflects the increase in the interest rate spread to 1.91 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.89 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while average net interest-earning assets increased 36.0 million period-to-period. The net interest margin increased to 2.32 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased from 3.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 4.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 1.84 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit from 3.22 in 2023 to 3.81 in 2024. The increase in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit contributed to migration from lower yielding savings accounts and money market accounts, to higher yielding certificates of deposit. The average balance of certificates of deposit increased from 208.6 million as of September 30, 2023, to 235.2 million as September 30, 2024, while over the same period the average balance of savings accounts decreased from 93.1 million to 79.8 million, and the average balance of money market accounts decreased from 31.7 million to 22.2 million. Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses . The recovery of credit losses on loans decreased 100,000 to 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 100,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans represented 0.46 of total loans at September 30, 2024, and 0.76 of total loans at September 30, 2023. The recovery of credit losses is based on our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses throughout the reporting period.

The recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments is based on an evaluation of the historical usage rate. Total non-performing loans were 647,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0 at September 30, 2023. We did not have any loans over 90 days delinquent at September 30, 2023 compared to 647,000 at September 30, 2024. Classified loans totaled 647,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 106,000 at September 30, 2023. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for credit losses on loans was 262.6 at September 30, 2024, and there were no non-performing loans at September 30, 2023. Noninterest Income . Noninterest income totaled 252,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3,000, or 1.2 , from 249,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest Expense . Noninterest expense increased 1.6 million, or 59.9 , to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 243,000, or 15.9 , an increase in occupancy and equipment expense of 28,000, or 6.5 , an increase in professional and legal fees of 16,000, or 41.0 , an increase in data processing expense of 9,000, or 3.3 , an increase in audit and examination fees of 68,000, or 194.3 , and an increase in charitable contributions of 1.3 million, or 9,615.4 from establishing the Fifth District Community Foundation, partially offset by a 5,000, or 8.8 , decrease in FDIC insurance expense, an 18,000, or 19.8 decrease in directors fees, and a 25,000, or 45.5 decrease in advertising. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes . The provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased by 220,000, or 2,200.0 , to 210,000) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a 1.0 million, or 2,136.7 , decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rate was 21 for both periods. Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General . Net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1.2) million, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 299.8 , compared to 619,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss was primarily from an increase in non-interest expense of 1.9 million resulting from a 1.3 million charitable contribution to establish the Fifth District Community Foundation, an increase in interest expense of 2.6 million, a decrease in non-interest income of 956,000, partially offset by an increase in interest income of 2.0 million, and a 493,000 decrease in provision for income taxes. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased by 2.0 million, or 16.1 , to 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income is attributed to a 931,000, or 8.9 , increase in interest on loans, a 624,000, or 135.4 , increase in interest on other interest-earning assets and 402,000, or 31.6 , increase in interest on investment securities available-for-sale. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average loans receivable, net, increased by 9.6 million, or 2.7 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on loans increased to 4.13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the rising market interest rate environment. The average balance of investment securities available-for-sale decreased 1.8 million, or 2.4 , to 71.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 73.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on available-for-sale investment securities increased to 3.13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average yield on

Table of Contents 
 available-for-sale investment securities was primarily due to the rising market interest rate environment as well as selling low yielding bonds to reinvest in higher yielding bonds. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents, comprised primarily of certificate of deposit in other financial institutions and overnight deposits, increased by 620,000, or 140.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to an increase in the average yield to 5.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average yield was due to the rise in market interest rates. Interest Expense . Total interest expense increased 2.6 million, or 58.6 , to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the average cost of deposits to 2.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.48 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the rising market interest rate environment. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by 1.6 million, or 0.4 , to 390.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 388.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased 602,000, or 7.7 , to 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease reflects the decrease in the interest rate spread to 1.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while average net interest-earning assets increased 21.6 million period-to-period. The net interest margin decreased to 2.06 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Both the interest rate spread and net interest margin decreased due to the rising interest rate environment. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased from 3.65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 4.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 1.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.37 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit from 2.71 in 2023 to 3.81 in 2024. The increase in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit contributed to migration from lower yielding savings accounts, NOW accounts and money market accounts, to higher yielding certificates of deposit. The average balance of certificates of deposit increased from 201.3 million as of September 30, 2023, to 236.3 million as of September 30, 2024, while over the same period the average balance of savings accounts decreased from 97.5 million to 81.9 million, the average balance of NOW accounts decreased from 53.9 million to 48.0 million and the average balance of money market accounts decreased from 35.6 million to 23.9 million. Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses . The recovery of credit losses on loans increased 1.0 million to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 100,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The recovery was primarily due to changes in the peer group for the CECL calculation. The allowance for credit losses on loans represented 0.46 of total loans at September 30, 2024, and 0.86 of total loans at September 30, 2023. The recovery of credit losses is based on our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses throughout the reporting period. The recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments increased 110,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to no recovery for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments is based on an evaluation of the historical usage rate. Total non-performing loans were 647,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0 at September 30, 2023. We did not have any loans over 90 days delinquent at September 30, 2023 compared to 647,000 at September 30, 2024. Classified loans totaled 647,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 106,000 at September 30, 2023. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for credit losses on loans was 262.6 at September 30, 2024, and there were no non-performing loans at September 30, 2023. Noninterest Income (Loss) . Noninterest income (loss) totaled 231,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 956,000, or 131.9 , from 725,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 1.1 million realized loss on the sale of investment securities available-for-sale and a 10,000, or 3.3 , decrease in ATM and check card fees, offset by a 34,000, or 14.4 , increase in the cash surrender value of the

 bank owned life insurance, a 13,000, or 8.6 , increase in deposit service charges and fees, and a 141,000 gain on sale of property. Noninterest Expense . Noninterest expense increased 1.9 million, or 24.2 , to 9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 382,000, or 8.4 , an increase in occupancy and equipment expense of 109,000, or 8.8 , an increase in FDIC insurance of 36,000, or 30.8 , an increase in data processing expense of 93,000, or 11.7 , an increase in audit and examination fees of 118,000, or 105.4 , an increase in other fees of 45,000 or 11.6 , and an increase in charitable contributions of 1.3 million, or 3,289.5 from establishing the Fifth District Community Foundation, offset by a 90,000, or 45.7 , decrease in advertising expense, and a 56,000, or 20.4 decrease in directors fees. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes . The provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased by 493,000, or 300.6 , to 329,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 164,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a 2.3 million, or 300.0 , decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rate was 21 for both periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and from two correspondent banks and, until March 11, 2024, had the ability to obtain advances under the Federal Reserve Board s Bank Term Funding Program. Under the terms of the Bank Term Funding Program, advances cannot be obtained after March 11, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balances under the correspondent bank credit facilities and no outstanding balance under the Bank Term Funding Program. Time deposits that meet or exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limit of 250,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 45.2 million and 42.2 million, respectively. Based on collateral pledged, consisting of all shares of FHLB stock owned and the blanket pledge of approximately 237.0 million of its qualifying mortgage loans as of September 30, 2024, the Company was eligible to borrow up to an additional 180.5 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has an unsecured federal funds line of credit with FNBB that expires on September 30, 2025. The Company is eligible to borrow up to 27.2 million. There was no amount outstanding on this line of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is eligible to borrow from TIB s Federal Funds Purchase Line Program, which provides overnight liquidity through pledge of certain qualifying securities. The Bank is eligible to borrow up to 15.0 million and repayment is due the next day. There was no amount outstanding on this line of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.

Table of Contents 
 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. See the accompanying Statements of Cash Flows for further information. Fifth District Bancorp, Inc. is a separate legal entity from Fifth District Savings Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations. Its primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to the Company is governed by applicable bank regulations. At September 30, 2024, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of 21.4 million. We believe we maintain a strong liquidity position, and are committed to maintaining it. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. At September 30, 2024, the Bank was categorized as well-capitalized under applicable bank regulatory capital guidelines. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change its category. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At September 30, 2024, we had 23.6 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans, which primarily consists of 8.4 million of remaining funds to be disbursed on construction loans in process and 13.4 million of unused balances of home equity lines of credit. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature on or before September 30, 2025 totaled 215.2 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts or utilize Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas advances, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Management of Market Risk General . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. All directors participate in discussions during the regular board meetings evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, and the level of risk that is appropriate. These discussions take into consideration our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by them. The board of directors establishes policies and guidelines for managing interest rate risk. Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we are using to manage interest rate risk are: maintaining capital levels that substantially exceed the thresholds for well-capitalized status under federal regulations; maintaining a high liquidity level; growing our core deposit accounts; and managing our investment securities portfolio to reduce the average maturity and effective life of the portfolio. 
 By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates.

 We have not engaged in hedging activities, such as investing in futures or options. We do not anticipate entering into hedging transactions in the future. Economic Value of Equity . We compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (economic value of equity or EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantaneously by 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis point increments or decreases instantaneously by 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve. All estimated changes presented in the table are within the policy limits established by the board of directors. 

At September 30, 2024 EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase EVE (Decrease) Change in Interest Rates (basis points) (1) Estimated EVE (2) Amount Percent EVE Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) 400 52,713 (56,237) (51.62) 13.56 (960) 300 63,445 (45,505) (41.77) 15.66 (750) 200 77,920 (31,030) (28.48) 18.31 (485) 100 93,572 (15,378) (14.11) 20.89 (227) Level 108,950 23.16 (100) 120,964 12,014 11.03 24.51 135 (200) 131,033 22,083 20.27 25.35 219 (300) 137,532 28,582 26.23 25.53 237 (400) 139,425 30,475 27.97 24.98 182 

 (1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. (2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. 
 The table above indicates that at September 30, 2024, we would have experienced a 28.48 decrease in EVE in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 20.27 increase in EVE in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates.

 Change in Net Interest Income. The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve. All estimated changes presented in the table are within the policy limits established by the board of directors. 

At September 30, 2024 Change in Interest Rates Net Interest Income Year 1 (basis points) (1) Forecast Year 1 Change from Level (Dollars in thousands) 400 8,528 (33.40) 300 9,612 (24.94) 200 10,718 (16.31) 100 11,771 (8.08) Level 12,806 (100) 13,030 1.75 (200) 13,129 2.52 (300) 13,149 2.68 (400) 13,205 3.12 

 (1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. 
 The table above indicates that as of September 30, 2024, we would have experienced a 16.31 decrease in net interest income in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 2.52 increase in net interest income in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE and NII require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For instance, the EVE and NII tables presented above assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. However, the shape of the yield curve changes constantly and the value and pricing of our assets and liabilities, including our deposits, may not closely correlate with changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE and NII tables may provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time and in the context of a particular yield curve, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and NII and will differ from actual results. EVE and net interest NII calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The information in Item 2 under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management of Market Risk is incorporated in this Item 3 by reference. Item 4. Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses disclosed above in Item 2 under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Table of Contents 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting, except as follows to address the material weaknesses disclosed above in Item 2 under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Internal Control Over Financial Reporting : We currently are assessing and improving our processes and control procedures to ensure they will operate at an acceptable level of assurance. The remedial measures we will take to address these material weaknesses include calculating an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments; revising the peer group of institutions to include institutions whose loan portfolios better reflect the composition of our loan portfolio; obtaining updated independent appraisals for loans being evaluated for impairment; enhancing qualitative factors support to include data points tied to a specified timeframe, such as, for example, the unemployment rate, to consistently allocate basis point reserves for each reporting period; using qualitative factors to adjust the allowance for credit losses for economic conditions that impact us and documenting the adjustments in a narrative accompanying the allowance calculation; and assigning an independent individual to review the allowance calculation to assure its accuracy and completeness.
