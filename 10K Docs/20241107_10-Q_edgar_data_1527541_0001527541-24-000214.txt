 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Form 10-Q") of Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (the "Trust," the "REIT," the "Company," "WHLR," "we," "our" or "us") contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe the Company's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words "may", "will", "should", "estimates", "projects", "anticipates", "believes", "expects", "intends", "future", and words of similar import, or the negative thereof. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. You are cautioned to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results. 
 
 Factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to: 
 
 the use of and demand for retail space;

 consumer spending and confidence trends; 
 availability, terms and deployment of capital; 
 substantial dilution of our common stock, par value 0.01 ("Common Stock") and steep decline in its market value resulting from the exercise by the holders of our Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series D Preferred Stock") of their redemption rights and downward adjustment of the conversion price on our outstanding 7.00 Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2031 (the "Convertible Notes"), each of which has already occurred and is anticipated to continue; 
 given the volatility in the trading of our Common Stock, whether we have registered a sufficient number of shares of our Common Stock to cover all Series D Preferred Stock redemptions tendered to us by the holders thereof; 
 the degree and nature of our competition; 
 changes in governmental regulations, accounting rules, tax rates and similar matters; 
 the ability and willingness of the Company s tenants and other third parties to satisfy their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with the Company;

 litigation risks generally; 
 the risk that shareholder litigation filed by the Company's former CEO, Daniel Khoshaba, may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, and divert management's attention away from running the Company; 
 financing risks, such as the Company s inability to obtain new financing or refinancing on favorable terms as the result of market volatility or instability and increases in the Company s borrowing costs as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors;

 damage to the Company s properties from catastrophic weather and other natural events, and the physical effects of climate change; 
 the risk that an uninsured loss on the Company s properties or a loss that exceeds the limits of the Company s insurance policies could subject the Company to lost capital or revenue on those properties; 
 the risk that continued increases in the cost of necessary insurance could negatively impact the Company's profitability; 
 the Company s ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") in light of economic, market, legal, tax and other considerations;

 the impact of e-commerce on our tenants business; and 
 the inability to generate sufficient cash flows due to market conditions, competition, uninsured losses, changes in tax or other applicable laws. 
 
 Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should be read in light of these factors. Except for ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by the federal securities laws, the Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. All of the above factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect the Company s actual results and may be beyond the Company s control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company s management to predict all such factors or to assess the effects of each factor on the Company s business. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company s current expectations will be realized.

 Company Overview 
 
 The Company, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment trust that owns, leases and operates income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers. In August 2022, the Company acquired Cedar Realty Trust. As a result of that acquisition, Cedar became a subsidiary of the Company. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company, through the Operating Partnership, owned and operated seventy-three retail shopping centers and two undeveloped properties in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, Connecticut, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Maryland and West Virginia . This list includes the properties acquired through the Cedar Acquisition. 
 
 The Company s portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions, and is geographically concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast, which markets represent approximately 46 , 42 and 12 respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of September 30, 2024. The Company s geographic concentration may cause it to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. Additionally, the Company s retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants.

Big Lots leased five locations from us (collectively, the "Big Lots Leases"). At September 30, 2024, the Big Lots Leases consist of 170,725 square feet and constitute approximately 1.5 of our portfolio's annualized base rent in the aggregate.

 Big Lots is entitled to certain rights under the Bankruptcy Code regarding the assumption or rejection of its leases, including the Big Lots Leases. We are currently negotiating with Big Lots on potential modifications to certain of the Big Lots Leases that may be assumed and assigned as part of the currently pending or other sale of its business. There can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful and which Big Lots Leases, if any, will be assumed by Big Lots and assigned to a

purchaser of its business. If successful, any such modifications would not occur unless a sale of Big Lots business is agreed, the Bankruptcy Court approves the sale, and the sale closes. Any Big Lots Leases not assumed by Big Lots will likely be rejected, which would entitle us to a rejection damages claim.

 In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, we have made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A summary of our critical accounting estimates and policies is included in our 2023 Form 10-K under "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes to these estimates and policies previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. For disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.

 Revenues were lower primarily as a result of (1) a decrease in market lease amortization of 0.4 million, (2) an increase in credit adjustments on operating lease receivables of 0.3 million primarily due to the Big Lots bankruptcy and (3) a decrease in other income of 0.1 million, partially offset by (4) an increase in tenant reimbursements of 0.4 million. 
 
 Property Operating expenses were lower primarily as a result of a decrease of 0.3 million in repairs and maintenance. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization were lower primarily as a result of the purchase price allocation of lease intangibles due to the timing of the Cedar Acquisition and sold properties in 2024. 
 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses were lower primarily as a result of (1) a decrease in legal fees of 0.2 million and (2) a decrease in salaries of 0.2 million.

 (1) Includes the fair value adjustment for the paid-in-kind interest. 
 
 Net changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities was a 39.3 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents a non-cash adjustment from a change in the fair value, primarily related to the conversion rate on the Convertible Notes which can only be adjusted downward based on the redemption price(s) of the Series D Preferred Stock relative to market trade prices of the Convertible Notes and Common Stock. See Note 7 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
 
 Other expense represents expenses which are non-operating in nature. Other expenses were 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of capital structure costs, including legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits, the registration of our Common Stock to issue in settlement of the Series D Preferred Stock redemptions and redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock by holders thereof. Other expenses were 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of capital structure costs including repurchase Convertible Notes and legal and other expenses incurred in connection with redemptions by holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and August 2023 Reverse Stock Split. 

Year-To-Date Comparison 
 
 The following table presents a comparison of the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Changes 2024 2023 Dollars Percent Revenues 76,981 76,110 871 1.1 Property operating expense (26,158) (26,068) (90) (0.3) Property operating income 50,823 50,042 781 Depreciation and amortization (19,212) (21,642) 2,430 11.2 Impairment charges (1,195) (1,195) n/a Corporate general administrative (7,488) (8,364) 876 10.5 Gain on disposal of properties, net 9,966 2,204 7,762 352.2 Interest income 256 336 (80) (23.8) Gain on investment securities, net 779 80 699 873.8 Interest expense (24,034) (24,125) 91 0.4 Net changes in fair value of derivative liabilities (49,774) (6,281) (43,493) (692.5) Loss on conversion of Convertible Notes (368) (368) n/a Gain on preferred stock redemptions 2,739 2,739 n/a Other expense (1,486) (5,273) 3,787 71.8 Income tax expense (1) (48) 47 97.9 Net Loss (38,995) (13,071) (25,924) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 8,088 8,061 27 0.3 Net Loss Attributable to Wheeler REIT (47,083) (21,132) (25,951) 
 
 Revenues were higher primarily as a result of (1) an increase in tenant reimbursements of 1.7 million and (2) an increase in base rent of 0.9 million, partially offset by (3) a decrease in market lease amortization of 1.3 million and (4) a decrease in other income of 0.4 million. 
 
 Property Operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of (1) an increase in insurance of 0.2 million and (2) an increase in grounds and landscaping of 0.2 million, partially offset by (3) a decrease of 0.2 million in ground rent expense a result of the 2023 acquisition of a land parcel located on the Company's property, Devine Street and (4) a decrease of 0.1 million in real estate tax expense a result of a successful real estate tax appeal at a property. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization were lower primarily as a result of the purchase price allocation of lease intangibles due to the timing of the Cedar Acquisition, a property held for sale in 2024 and properties that were sold in 2024. 
 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses were lower primarily as a result of (1) a decrease in legal fees of 0.8 million and (2) a decrease in salaries of 0.1 million. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 0.4 . Below is a comparison of the components which make up interest expense (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Changes 2024 2023 Dollars Percent Property debt interest - excluding Cedar debt 12,715 11,850 865 7.3 Convertible Notes interest (1)

 (1) Includes the fair value adjustment for the paid-in-kind interest. 
 
 The above increase in property debt interest inclusive of Cedar debt was 1.5 million a result of (1) an increase of 1.0 million due to an increase in the overall average interest rate and (2) an increase of 0.5 million in the average principal debt balance. 
 
 Net changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities was a 49.8 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents a non-cash adjustment from a change in the fair value, primarily related to the conversion rate on the Convertible Notes which can only be adjusted downward based on the redemption price(s) of the Series D Preferred Stock relative to market trade prices of the Convertible Notes and Common Stock. See Note 7 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
 
 Other expense represents expenses which are non-operating in nature. Other expenses were 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of capital structure costs, including repurchase of Convertible Notes and legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits, the registration of our Common Stock to issue in settlement of Series D Preferred Stock redemptions and redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock by holders thereof. Other expenses were 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of capital structure costs to repurchase Convertible Notes and the Exchange Offer for the Company's outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, redemptions by holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and August 2023 Reverse Stock Split. 

Same-Property Net Operating Income 
 
 Same-property net operating income ("Same-Property NOI") is a widely-used non-GAAP financial measure for REITs. The Company believes that Same-Property NOI is a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company defines Same-Property NOI as property revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Because Same-Property NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or capital expenditures and leasing costs and impairment charges, it provides a performance measure, that when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. The Company uses Same-Property NOI to evaluate its operating performance since Same-Property NOI allows the Company to evaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and returns. Properties are included in Same-Property NOI if they are owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared. Consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under GAAP, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are excluded from Same-Property NOI. 
 
 30 

The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is consolidated operating income. Same-Property NOI should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated operating income prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. Further, Same-Property NOI is a measure for which there is no standard industry definition and, as such, it is not consistently defined or reported on among the Company's peers, and thus may not provide an adequate basis for comparison among REITs. 
 
 The following table is a reconciliation of Same-Property NOI from operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, unaudited) Operating Income 13,894 9,287 32,894 22,240 Add (deduct): Gain on disposal of properties, net 
 (7,083) (2,204) (9,966) (2,204) Corporate general administrative 2,101 2,475 7,488 8,364 Impairment charges 1,195 1,195 Depreciation and amortization 6,241 6,875 19,212 21,642 Straight-line rents (159) (285) (885) (1,004) Above (below) market lease amortization, net (834) (1,232) (2,607) (3,865) Other non-property revenue (5) (18) (55) NOI related to properties not defined as same-property (427) (448) (1,341) (1,398) Same-Property Net Operating Income 14,923 14,468 45,972 43,720 
 
 Total Same-Property NOI was 14.9 million and 14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of 3.1 due to a 1.1 increase in property revenue and a 2.4 decrease in property expenses. 
 
 Total Same-Property NOI was 46.0 million and 43.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of 5.2 primarily due to a 3.5 increase in property revenue, partially offset by a 0.6 increase in property expenses. 
 
 Funds from Operations 
 
 We use funds from operations ("FFO"), a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations and liquidity. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("Nareit") in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and December 2018). As defined by Nareit, FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of loan origination costs), plus impairment of real estate related long-lived assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods, or as compared to different companies. Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while historically real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a valuable alternative measurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating results. 
 
 We believe the computation of FFO in accordance with Nareit's definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash amortization on loans and acquisition costs. Therefore, in addition to FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO ("AFFO"), which we define to exclude such items. Management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in determining AFFO as they are not indicative of the operating performance of our assets. In 
 31 

addition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, there can be no assurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs. 
 A reconciliation of net loss to FFO available to common stockholders and AFFO is shown in the table below (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net Loss (30,631) (11,368) (38,995) (13,071) Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 6,241 6,875 19,212 21,642 Impairment charges 1,195 1,195 Gain on disposal of properties, net

 Other non-recurring and non-cash expenses are costs of the Company that we believe will not be incurred on a go-forward basis. Other non-recurring expenses were 0.0 million and 0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, a result of loan defeasance payments. Other non-recurring expenses were 0.0 million and 2.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, a result of 1.8 million in loan defeasance payments and 0.2 million costs to demolish a decommissioned space not included in the Company's gross leasable area. 
 
 Inflation, Deflation and Economic Condition Considerations 
 
 Substantially all of the Company s leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions include clauses that require tenants to reimburse the Company for inflation-sensitive costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and many of the operating expenses it incurs. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. However, s ignificant inflation rate increases over a prolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the Company s business. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income. 
 
 Interest rate increases could result in higher incremental borrowing costs for the Company and our tenants. The duration of the Company's indebtedness and our relatively low exposure to floating rate debt have mitigated the direct impact of inflation and interest rate increases. The degree and pace of these changes have had and may continue to have impacts on our business. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 32 

At September 30, 2024, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 55.0 million compared to consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 48.9 million at September 30, 2023. Cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows (in thousands, unaudited): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Changes 2024 2023 Dollars Percent Operating activities 20,588 15,032 5,556 37.0 Investing activities 1,562 (19,618) 21,180 108.0 Financing activities (6,938) (2,422) (4,516) (186.5) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash flows from operating activities increased 5.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities, before net changes in operating assets and liabilities, was 20.8 million and 15.2 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to (1) a 4.7 million decrease in corporate administrative expenses and other expenses and (2) a 2.3 million increase in Same-Property NOI, partially offset by (3) 1.0 million of Cedar Series C Preferred Stock repurchases and (4) a 0.4 million increase in cash paid for interest. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our cash flows from investing activities increased 21.2 million, primarily due to (1) the proceeds from the sale of Kings Plaza, Oakland Commons and Edenton Commons Land Parcel, (2) the investment subscription with SAI of 0.5 million and 3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and (3) the 2023 acquisition of the St. George Plaza Land Parcel, partially offset by (4) the increase in capital expenditures of 7.0 million and proceeds from the 2023 sale of Carll's Corner Outparcel. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Our cash flows used in financing activities were 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash flows used in financing activities of 2.4 million for the comparable period in 2023. 
 
 Financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of: 
 
 Cash inflows: 
 3.9 million 2024 loan refinancing activities, net; 
 5.2 million draw on Cedar Revolving Credit Agreement; and 
 2.5 million draw on Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement. 
 
 Cash outflows: 
 8.1 million for distributions paid on noncontrolling interests; 
 1.6 million payments for deferred financing costs; 
 5.2 million payment on Cedar Revolving Credit Agreement; 
 1.3 million repurchase of debt securities; 
 1.0 million scheduled loan principal payments on debt; 
 1.0 million repurchase of noncontrolling interests; and 
 0.4 million defeasance payments. 
 
 Financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of: 
 
 Cash inflows: 
 16.4 million 2023 loan refinancing activities, net, including loan agreement for Timpany Plaza; 
 
 Cash outflows: 
 8.1 million for distributions paid on noncontrolling interests; 
 4.4 million payments for deferred financing costs; 
 3.1 million repurchase of debt securities; 
 33 

1.8 million defeasance payments; and 
 1.4 million scheduled loan principal payments on debt. 
 
 The Company continues to endeavor to manage its debt prudently with the objective of achieving a conservative capital structure and minimizing leverage within the Company. Our debt balances, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, consisted of the following (in thousands) : 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (unaudited) Fixed-rate notes 500,331 495,572 Total debt 500,331 495,572 
 
 The weighted average interest rate and term of our fixed-rate debt were 5.53 and 7.8 years, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The weighted average interest rate and term of our fixed-rate debt were 5.42 and 8.4 years, respectively, at September 30, 2023. We have 1.6 million of debt maturing during the twelve months ending September 30, 2025. While we anticipate being able to refinance all the loans at reasonable market terms upon maturity, our inability to do so may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. See Note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional mortgage indebtedness details. 
 
 NASDAQ Notices 
 
 On December 7, 2023, the listing qualifications staff (the "Staff") of Nasdaq notified the Company that based on the Common Stock s bid price closing below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer complied with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the "Bid Price Rule") and that Company had a 180-day compliance period. This rule requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. 
 
 On June 3, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule. 
 
 On June 28, 2024, the Staff notified the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4), which requires the Company to have a minimum of 500,000 "Publicly Held Shares" (defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5005(a)(35) as "shares not held directly or indirectly by an officer, director or any person who is the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of the total shares outstanding") (the "Publicly Held Shares Rule"). Per the Staff's notice, the Company had until July 12, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance. 
 
 On July 12, 2024, the Company timely submitted its plan of compliance to the Staff (the "Compliance Plan"). The Compliance Plan provided, among other things, that the Company believes that, following its registration of approximately 20 million shares of its Common Stock with the SEC under the Prospectus, it will issue Common Stock in settlement of Series D Preferred Stock redemptions commencing with the August 5, 2024 Holder Redemption Date in such an amount that, within the next couple of months and certainly by December 25, 2024 (which is 180 days from the date of the Staff's letter, June 28, 2024), it will have achieved compliance with the Publicly Held Shares Rule. 
 
 On July 30, 2024, the Staff provided the Company with written notice of an extension through December 25, 2024 (the "Compliance Deadline") to regain compliance with the Publicly Held Shares Rule. Per such notice, on or before the Compliance Deadline, the Company must file with the SEC and Nasdaq a public document containing its current total shares of Common Stock outstanding and a beneficial ownership table in accordance with SEC proxy rules demonstrating compliance with the Publicly Held Shares Rule. 
 
 Subsequent to July 30, 2024, the Company has issued shares of its Common Stock in settlement of the Series D Preferred Stock redemptions and upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes. The Company believes that, following such issuances, it is now in compliance with the Publicly Held Shares Rule because all shares so issued are considered Publicly Held Shares, and when added to the Publicly Held Shares already outstanding, exceed in the aggregate the minimum of 500,000 "Publicly Held Shares" required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4). As of November 6, the Company had 1,200,110 Publicly Held Shares outstanding. 
 34 

Material Cash Requirements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 Our expected material cash requirements for the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 and thereafter are comprised of (i) contractually obligated expenditures; (ii) other essential expenditures; (iii) other investments; and (iv) repurchases of noncontrolling interests (Cedar securities, including the Cedar Tender Offer). 
 
 The primary liquidity needs of the Company, in addition to the funding of our ongoing operations, at September 30, 2024 are 1.6 million in principal and regularly scheduled payments due in the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 as described in Note 6 in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In addition, the Company has 3.1 million outstanding construction commitments at September 30, 2024. 
 
 In addition to liquidity required to fund debt payments, we may incur some level of capital expenditures during the year for our existing properties that cannot be passed on to our tenants. 
 
 To meet these future liquidity needs, the Company: 
 had 37.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024; 
 had 17.9 million held in lender reserves for the purpose of tenant improvements, lease commissions, real estate taxes and insurance at September 30, 2024; and 
 intends to use cash generated from operations during the twelve months ending September 30, 2025. 
 
 Additionally, the Company plans to undertake measures to grow its operations and increase liquidity through delivering space currently leased but not yet occupied, backfilling vacant anchor spaces, replacing tenants who are in default of their lease terms, increasing future lease revenue through tenant improvements partially funded by restricted cash, disposition of non-core assets in the ordinary course of business and refinancing properties. 
 
 In order to continue qualifying as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90 of its "REIT taxable income," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Future dividend declarations will continue to be at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and will depend on the cash flow and financial condition of the Company, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. The Company intends to continue to operate its business in a manner that will allow it to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax requirements. 
 
 Our success in executing on our strategy will dictate our liquidity needs going forward. If we are unable to execute in these areas, our ability to grow may be limited without additional capital. 
 
 Convertible Notes 
 
 The Convertible Notes have caused, and could continue to cause, substantial dilution of the Series D Preferred Stock and reduction in the value of any Series D Preferred Stock if interest thereon continues to be paid in the future in shares of Series D Preferred Stock. In addition, depending on the prices at which the ongoing monthly redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock occur, the conversion price for the Convertible Notes could continue to be repeatedly adjusted downwards, which has caused, and could continue to cause, significant downward pressure on the value of the Company s Common Stock. 
 
 Series D Preferred Stock 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 61.7 million, with aggregate accrued and unpaid dividends in the amount of approximately 35.2 million, for a total liquidation value of 96.9 million. After September 21, 2023, each holder of Series D Preferred Stock has the right, at such holder s option, to request that the Company redeem any or all of such holder s shares of Series D Preferred Stock on a monthly basis. 
 
 As the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock continue to exercise their redemption rights on a monthly basis, the Company will continue to pay the aggregate redemption price in shares of our Common Stock. The Company does not believe it is in its interests to liquidate assets or incur indebtedness to fund cash redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock and, accordingly, it has no intention of doing so. Therefore, the Company intends to continue to settle redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock in Common Stock. We believe that the issuance of Common Stock to settle redemptions in Common Stock will continue to result in a substantial dilution of the outstanding Common Stock.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 28,105 shares of its Common Stock, having an aggregate fair value of 0.4 million, to settle conversion requests by certain holders thereof comprising an aggregate principal amount of 0.1 million. The Company determined the conversion price on each conversion date in accordance with Section 14.02 (Optional Conversion) of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. Each conversion settled in accordance with customary settlement cycles. The Company did not receive any cash proceeds as a result of any such conversion, and the Convertible Notes that were converted have been retired and cancelled. 
 
 The Company issued the Common Stock in these conversions in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act contained in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act on the basis that such issuance of Common Stock constituted an exchange with an existing holder of the Company s securities, and no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such transaction. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 
 Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) , modified or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
