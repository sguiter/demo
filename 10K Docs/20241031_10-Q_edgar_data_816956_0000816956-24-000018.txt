Adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration for In2Bones were driven principally by the level of In2Bones revenue and reflect various factors, including a delayed recovery from supply chain constraints, delays in product registrations and integration disruptions. Biorez adjustments to fair value of contingent consideration principally relate to the level of Biorez revenue driven by the expected timing of clinical trial results.

 Seventh Amended and Restated Senior Credit Agreement 
 
 On July 16, 2021, we entered into a seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement consisting of: (a) a million term loan facility and (b) a million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility will terminate and the loans outstanding under the term loan facility will expire on July 16, 2026. The term loan was payable in quarterly installments increasing over the term of the facility. During 2022, we made a million prepayment on the term loan facility resulting in the elimination of such quarterly payments with the remaining balance due upon the expiration of the term loan facility. Proceeds from the term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to repay the then existing senior credit agreement. On July 19, 2024, we amended our seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement to exclude from the calculation of consolidated fixed charges the million payment we made in February 2024 of our then-outstanding Notes. Interest rates are at the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus ("Adjusted Term SOFR") at September 30, 2024) plus an interest rate margin of at September 30, 2024). For borrowings where we elect to use the alternate base rate, the initial base rate is the greatest of (i) the Prime Rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus or (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus , plus, in each case, an interest rate margin. 
 
 There were million in borrowings outstanding on the term loan facility as of September 30, 2024. There were million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. Our available borrowings on the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024 were million with approximately million of the facility set aside for outstanding letters of credit. The carrying amounts of the term loan and revolving credit facility approximate fair value. 
 
 The seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property and assets. The seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions which, among other things, require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrict dividend payments and the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities, including acquisitions and dispositions. We were in full compliance with these covenants and

 Convertible Notes 
 
 On January 29, 2019, we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes that were due in 2024 (the " Notes"). Interest was payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 2019. The Notes were scheduled to mature on February 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased or converted. 
 
 The Notes represented subordinated unsecured obligations and were convertible under certain circumstances, as defined in the indenture, into a combination of cash and CONMED common stock. The Notes could have been converted at an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock). Holders of the Notes could have converted the Notes at their option at any time on or after November 1, 2023 through the second scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date. Holders of the Notes also had the right to convert the Notes prior to November 1, 2023, but only upon the occurrence of specified events. The conversion rate was subject to anti-dilution adjustments if certain events occurred. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes was used as part of the financing for the Buffalo Filter acquisition and million were used to pay the cost of certain convertible notes hedge transactions as further described below. 
 
 On June 6, 2022, the Company repurchased and extinguished million principal amount of the Notes for aggregate consideration consisting of million in cash and approximately million shares of the Company's common stock. Concurrently, the Company entered into a Supplemental Indenture related to the remaining million in Notes, in which the Company irrevocably elected to settle the principal value of those Notes in cash. In February 2024, the Company repaid the remaining million then outstanding of the Notes through borrowings on our revolving credit facility and issued million shares of the Company's common stock. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we have recorded interest expense on the Notes of million, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have recorded interest expense on the Notes of million and million, respectively, at the contractual coupon rate of . 
 
 Convertible Notes 
 
 On June 6, 2022, we issued million aggregate principal amount of Notes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2022. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2027, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Notes represent subordinated unsecured obligations and are convertible under certain circumstances, as defined in the indenture, into a combination of cash and CONMED common stock, with the principal required to be paid in cash. The Notes may be converted at an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock). Holders of the Notes may convert the Notes at their option at any time on or after March 15, 2027 through the second scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date. Holders of the Notes will also have the right to convert the Notes prior to March 15, 2027, but only upon the occurrence of specified events. The conversion rate is subject to anti-dilution adjustments if certain events occur. A portion of these proceeds were used to repurchase and extinguish a portion of the Notes, pay off our then outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit, pay down of million of our term loan and partially pay for the In2Bones acquisition. In addition, approximately million of the proceeds were used to pay the cost of certain convertible notes hedge transactions related to the Notes. 
 
 For both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have recorded interest expense on the Notes of million, and for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have recorded interest expense on the Notes of million, at the contractual coupon rate of 
 
 The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately million as of September 30, 2024 based on a market approach which represents a Level 2 valuation in the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value was determined based on the estimated or actual bids and offers of the Notes in an over-the-counter market transaction on the last business day of the period.

and Notes, we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with a number of financial institutions (each, an option counterparty ). The convertible notes hedge transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the respective Notes, the number of shares of our common stock underlying the and Notes. Concurrent with entering into the convertible notes hedge transactions, we also entered into separate warrant transactions with each option counterparty whereby we sold to such option counterparty warrants to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the same number of shares of our common stock. 
 
 In connection with the repurchase and extinguishment of million principal amount of the Notes, the Company entered into agreements with the option counterparties to terminate a corresponding portion of the hedges on the Notes. Upon maturity in February 2024 of the remaining Notes and settlement of the related hedges, the Company received million shares from the option counterparties. 
 
 The convertible notes hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the convertible notes hedge transactions, is greater than the strike price of the convertible notes hedge transactions, which initially corresponds to the conversion price of the Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Notes. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the strike price for the Notes) of the warrants, there would nevertheless be dilution to the extent that such market price exceeds the strike price of the warrants, unless we elect to settle the warrants in cash.

 million per incident and million in the aggregate annually, which we believe is adequate. This coverage is on a claims-made basis. There can be no assurance that claims will not exceed insurance coverage, that the carriers will be solvent or that such insurance will be available to us in the future at a reasonable cost. 
 
 Our operations are subject, and in the past have been subject, to a number of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions; wastewater discharges; the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; soil and groundwater remediation and employee health and safety. Likewise, the operations of our suppliers and sterilizers are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations. In some jurisdictions, environmental requirements may be expected to become more stringent in the future. In the United States, certain environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of site restoration upon each of the parties that may have contributed to conditions at the site regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the party s activities. While we do not believe that the present costs of environmental compliance and remediation are material, there can be no assurance that future compliance or remedial obligations would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 CONMED has been defending two Georgia State Court actions. The first action was filed in May 2020 in Cobb County by various employees, former employees, contract workers and others against CONMED and against a contract sterilizer (the "Cobb County Action"). Plaintiffs alleged personal injury and related claims purportedly arising from or relating to exposure to Ethylene Oxide, a chemical used to sterilize certain products. CONMED s motion to dismiss action was heard on January 10, 2022, and the Court issued a ruling on June 15, 2022 dismissing 44 of the 51 plaintiffs' claims as precluded by the exclusive workers' compensation remedy, as well as one claim from a non-employee plaintiff. The remaining plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against CONMED such that all claims against CONMED in the Cobb County Action have now been dismissed and CONMED is no longer a named party to this case. 
 
 The second action was filed in April 2021 in Douglas County against CONMED s landlord and other allegedly related entities (the "Douglas County Action"). Plaintiff alleged the same injuries as the Cobb County Action. In July 2024, CONMED reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter for an amount covered by CONMED's insurance. As with any litigation, there are risks, including the risk that the settlement agreement might not be finalized, that the Landlord defendants may not prevail with respect to the defense of the underlying claims, and that CONMED may not prevail in securing the adequate insurance to cover the indemnification of any judgment. 
 
 CONMED submitted the foregoing claims for insurance coverage. One insurer is providing coverage for certain of the claims asserted directly against the Company. CONMED litigated two lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York with Federal Insurance Company Chubb ): one involving CONMED s claim for coverage for the indemnification claims arising from the Cobb County Action, and the other concerning CONMED s claim for coverage for the indemnification claims arising from the Douglas County Action. On March 10, 2022, the Court ruled in favor of CONMED

 events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 
 
 Amounts reported in millions within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are computed based on the amounts in thousands. As a result, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying unrounded amounts. 

Overview 
 
 CONMED Corporation CONMED , the Company , we or us is a medical technology company that provides devices and equipment for surgical procedures. The Company s products are used by surgeons and other healthcare professionals in a variety of specialties including orthopedics, general surgery, gynecology, thoracic surgery and gastroenterology. 
 
 Our product lines consist of orthopedic surgery and general surgery. Orthopedic surgery consists of sports medicine and lower extremities instrumentation and implants, small bone, large bone and specialty powered surgical instruments as well as imaging systems for use in minimally invasive surgery procedures and service fees related to the promotion and marketing of sports medicine allograft tissue. General surgery consists of a complete line of endo-mechanical instrumentation for minimally invasive laparoscopic and gastrointestinal procedures, smoke evacuation devices, a line of cardiac monitoring products as well as electrosurgical generators and related instruments. These product lines as a percentage of consolidated net sales are as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Orthopedic surgery 41 44 42 44 General surgery 59 56 58 56 Consolidated net sales 100 100 100 100 
 
 A significant amount of our products are used in surgical procedures with approximate ly 85 of our revenues derived from the sale of single-use products. Our capital equipment offerings also facilitate the ongoing sale of related single-use products and accessories, thus providing us with a recurring revenue stream. We manufacture substantially all of our products in facilities located in the United States and Mexico. We market our products both domestically and internationally directly to customers and through distributors. International sales approximated 43 and 44 of our consolidated net sales duri ng the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Business Environment 
 
 The Company has been and continues to be impacted by the macro-economic environment and we are experiencing higher manufacturing and operating costs caused by inflationary pressures and ongoing supply chain challenges. We work with suppliers to mitigate these impacts; however, we expect these challenges to continue through 2024. This will likely impact our results of operations. 
 
 The Company has not been materially impacted by the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The Company has no direct operations in these regions with our business limited to selling to third party distributors. Total revenues and accounts receivable associated with sales to third party distributors in these regions are not material to the consolidated condensed financial statements. We will continue to monitor and adjust our business strategy in response to the conflicts in these regions as necessary. 
 
 During the latter part of the third quarter of 2024, the path of Hurricane Helene impacted the Company s manufacturing facility in Largo, Florida and the Company s distribution center in Lithia Springs, Georgia. The Company prioritizes the safety of its employees, and ceased manufacturing operations at its Largo, Florida facility for approximately 24 hours. Then, during the early part of the fourth quarter of 2024, the path of Hurricane Milton impacted the Company's manufacturing facility in Largo, Florida and we again ceased manufacturing operations for four days. The facilities did not incur any significant damage as a result of these hurricanes, we have confirmed the safety of our employees and the Company

 has resumed normal operations. We are monitoring the impact these hurricanes had, and may continue to have, on hospitals and surgery centers, as well as supply chain, but cannot quantify the impact at this time. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the critical accounting policies used to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including, but not limited to, those related to goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration and our pension benefit obligation.

Net Sales 
 
 The following table presents net sales by product line for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended Change 2024 2023 As Reported Impact of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Orthopedic surgery 130.5 124.7 4.7 0.5 5.2 General surgery 186.2 179.9 3.5 0.1 3.6 Net sales 316.7 304.6 4.0 0.3 4.3 Single-use products 270.8 253.3 6.9 0.3 7.2 Capital products 45.9 51.3 (10.6) 0.2 (10.4) Net sales 316.7 304.6 4.0 0.3 4.3 Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 As Reported Impact of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Orthopedic surgery 405.0 396.6 2.1 0.5 2.6 General surgery 556.1 521.1 6.7 0.3 7.0 Net sales 961.1 917.7 4.7 0.4 5.1 Single-use products 814.8 767.3 6.2 0.4 6.6 Capital products 146.3 150.4 (2.7) 0.3 (2.4) Net sales 961.1 917.7 4.7 0.4 5.1 
 
 Net sales increased 4.0 and 4.7 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods a year ago. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to growth in both the orthopedic surgery and general surgery product lines. 
 
 Orthopedic surgery sales increased 4.7 and 2.1 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to growth in our sports medicine and BioBrace product offerings. 
 
 General surgery sales increased 3.5 and 6.7 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to growth in our AirSeal and biliary product offerings. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales increased to 137.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 136.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased to 426.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 423.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit margins increased 130 basis points to 56.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 55.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit margins increased 180 basis points to 55.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 53.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The 130 and 180 basis point increases in gross profit margins during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were mainly due to favorable product mix as well as during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred costs for the amortization of inventory step-up to fair value of 2.2 million and 6.5 million, respectively, related to the In2Bones acquisition.

Selling and Administrative Expense 
 
 Selling and administrative expense decreased to 99.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 125.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased to 345.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 385.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 960 basis points to 31.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 41.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased 600 basis points to 36.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 42.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by: 
 
 27.0 million and 42.3 million of income related to fair value adjustments to contingent consideration in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to expense of 3.2 million and 6.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, see Note 6; 
 2.1 million in costs related to the termination of distribution agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 
 6.1 million in costs related to the implementation of a new warehouse management system in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These costs mainly consisted of incremental freight, labor and travel costs as well as professional fees; 
 1.6 million in costs consisting of severance related to the elimination of certain positions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and 
 overall decrease in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales as we leverage our existing selling and administrative structure. 
 
 These decreases are offset by 1.9 million and 4.6 million in costs incurred for third party services pertaining to potential issues with certain royalty payments to design surgeons during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 
 Research and development expense increased to 13.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased to 41.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 38.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expense increased 20 basis points to 4.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 10 basis points to 4.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Spend as a percentage of sales was mainly driven by the timing of research and development projects. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense decreased to 9.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased to 28.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 30.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average interest rates on our borrowings decreased to 3.15 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.17 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average interest rates on our borrowings increased to 3.18 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.13 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by lower weighted average borrowings outstanding and lower weighted average interest rates during 2024. The decrease in interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by lower weighted average borrowings outstanding during 2024. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The Company's tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate applied to its year-to-date earnings, and also adjusting for discrete items arising in that quarter. In each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company would make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter.

Table of Contents 

 Income tax expense has been recorded at an effective tax rate of 13.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense has been recorded at an effective tax rate of 17.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily the result of the higher income in 2024 incurring a lower percentage of tax expense and income related to the fair value adjustments to contingent consideration which is not subject to federal tax. The three months ended September 30, 2024 included discrete income tax expense from stock option exercises which increased the effective tax rate by 0.1 and discrete income tax benefit from finalizing the 2023 federal tax return which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.1 . The three months ended September 30, 2023 included discrete income tax benefit from stock option exercises which reduced the effective tax rate by 0.3 and discrete income tax benefit from finalizing the 2022 federal tax return which decreased the effective tax rate by 7.4 . The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included discrete income tax expense from stock option exercises which increased the effective tax rate by 0.1 , discrete income tax benefit related to acquired federal research credits which decreased the effective tax rate by 0.3 and discrete income tax benefit from finalizing the 2023 federal tax return which decreased the effective tax rate by 1.0 . The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included discrete income tax benefit from stock option exercises which decreased the effective tax rate by 3.7 , discrete income tax benefit from finalizing the 2022 tax return which decreased the effective tax rate by 3.7 , and discrete income tax expense from foreign related taxes which increased the effective tax rate by 0.9 . A reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Net sales on a "constant currency" basis is a non-GAAP measure. The Company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, the Company removes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of net sales. 
 
 Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. This adjusted financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net sales growth, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is an additional way of viewing net sales that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of our business. The Company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investments, working capital requirements and payments on indebtedness under the seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement. We have historically met these liquidity requirements with funds generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, we have historically used term borrowings, including borrowings under the seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement to finance our acquisitions. We also have the ability to raise funds through the sale of stock or we may issue debt through a private placement or public offering. 
 
 Operating cash flows 
 
 Our net working capital position was 358.7 million at September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities was 123.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 69.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, generated on net income of 98.7 million and 31.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Significant changes in assets and liabilities affecting operating cash flows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the following: 
 
 An increase in cash flows from accounts receivable due to timing of sales and cash receipts compared to the same period a year ago; 
 A decrease in cash flows from inventory as we increased inventory to mitigate supply chain challenges; 
 An increase in cash flows from accounts payable due to the timing of payments; and 
 A decrease in cash flows from accrued compensation and benefits as a result of higher incentive compensation payments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period a year ago.

 Investing cash flows 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6.1 million from the same period a year ago primarily due to capital expenditures being lower at 9.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.2 million in the same period a year ago. 
 
 Financing cash flows 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 99.9 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 51.7 million during 2023. Below is a summary of the significant financing activities impacting the change during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023: 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid the remaining 70.0 million outstanding on the 2.625 Notes. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 48.1 million in contingent consideration related to the In2Bones and Biorez acquisitions. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net borrowings on our revolving line of credit of 34.0 million, compared to net payments of 48.0 million in the same period a year ago. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash proceeds of 5.0 million related to stock issued under employee plans compared to 16.5 million in the same period a year ago. 
 
 Other Liquidity Matters 
 
 Our cash balances and cash flows generated from operations may be used to fund strategic investments, business acquisitions, working capital needs, research and development, common stock repurchases and payments of dividends to our shareholders. Management believes that cash flow from operations, including cash and cash equivalents on hand and available borrowing capacity under our seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement, will be adequate to meet our anticipated operating working capital requirements, debt service, funding of capital expenditures, dividend payments and common stock repurchases in the foreseeable future. In addition, management believes we could access capital markets, as necessary, to fund future business acquisitions. 
 
 The Company is also being impacted by the macro-economic environment and we are experiencing higher manufacturing and operating costs caused by inflationary pressures and ongoing supply chain challenges. We continue to monitor our spending and expenses in light of these factors. However, we may need to take further steps to reduce our costs, or to refinance our debt. See Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion. 
 
 There were 114.6 million in borrowings outstanding on the term loan facility as of September 30, 2024. There were 36.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. Our available borrowings on the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024 were 547.4 million with approximately 1.6 million of the facility set aside for outstanding letters of credit. 
 
 The seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property and assets. The seventh amended and restated senior credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions which, among other things, require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrict dividend payments and the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities, including acquisitions and dispositions. We were in full compliance with these covenants and restrictions as of September 30, 2024. We are also required, under certain circumstances, to make mandatory prepayments from net cash proceeds from any issuance of equity and asset sales. 
 
 In February 2024, the Company repaid the remaining 70.0 million then outstanding of the 2.625 Notes through borrowings on our revolving credit facility and issued 0.1 million shares of the Company's common stock. 
 
 See Note 10 for further information on our financing agreements and outstanding debt obligations. 
 
 Our Board of Directors has authorized a 200.0 million share repurchase program. Through September 30, 2024, we have repurchased a total of 6.1 million shares of common stock aggregating 162.6 million under this authorization and have 37.4 million remaining available for share repurchases. The repurchase program calls for shares to be purchased in the open market or in private transactions from time to time. We may suspend or discontinue the share repurchase program at any time. We have not purchased any shares of common stock under the share repurchase program during 2024. We have financed the

 repurchases and may finance additional repurchases through operating cash flow and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
