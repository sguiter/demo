 The Company s cost to acquire these acquisitions was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the completion of the acquisition. The differences between the fair value of the consideration paid and the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was recorded as goodwill. The fair value of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities for the Adimec, Valeport and Xena Networks acquisition is provisional pending finalization of the Company s acquisition accounting, including the measurement of tax basis in certain jurisdictions and the resulting deferred taxes that might arise from book and tax basis differences, if any. Pro forma results of operations, the revenue and net income subsequent to the acquisition date, and a more detailed breakout of the major classes of assets and liabilities acquired for these acquisitions have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to the Company's financial results. The significant factors that resulted in recognition of goodwill for the 2023 and 2024 acquisitions included the acquired businesses market positions, growth opportunities in the markets in which they operate, their experienced work force and established operating infrastructures. The results of these acquisitions have been included in Teledyne s results since the dates of their respective acquisition.

 With the exception of the Engineered Systems segment, net sales in each segment are primarily derived from fixed price contracts. Net sales in the Engineered Systems segment are typically between and fixed price contracts in a given reporting period, with the balance of net sales derived from cost-reimbursable type contracts. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, approximately of net sales in the Engineered Systems segment were derived from fixed price contracts. 
 Contract Liabilities 
 Other long-term liabilities Total contract liabilities 
 The Company recognized revenue of million during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 from contract liabilities that existed at the beginning of year. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed as of the period end date and exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity). As of September 29, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was million. The Company expects approximately of remaining performance obligations to be recognized into revenue within the next , with the remaining recognized thereafter. 
 Changes in Contract Estimates at Completion 
 For over time contracts using the cost-to-cost method, the Company has an Estimate at Completion EAC process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations. This EAC process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue, determining reasonably dependable cost estimates, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. The majority of revenue recognized over time uses an EAC process. Since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings through a cumulative catch-up basis. This method recognizes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters. Additionally, if the current contract estimate indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident. Contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly. 
 The net aggregate effects of these changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost method in the first nine months of 2024 was million of favorable operating income compared with million of favorable operating income in the first nine months of 2023. None of the effects of changes in estimates on any individual contract were material to the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) for any period presented.

 An evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is required to be performed on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
 Based on the results of the Company s annual assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023, all reporting units with the exception of the FLIR reporting unit in the Digital Imaging segment had estimated fair values that exceeded their respective carrying value by more than . At the assessment date in the fourth quarter of 2023, the estimated fair value of the FLIR reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately million or , and the FLIR reporting unit had million of goodwill at the prior year assessment date. As of September 29, 2024, the FLIR reporting unit had million of goodwill, with the change in value from the prior year assessment date related to the impact of foreign currency translation. 
 Although the assumptions used in the Company s prior year discounted cash flow model and market approach are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results of the FLIR reporting unit. Changes in forecast estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. 
 Although no impairment existed for the FLIR reporting unit as of the prior year assessment date, a non-cash impairment of goodwill could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit, changes to customer spending priorities, or a sharp increase in interest rates without a corresponding increase in future net sales.

million and a fair value of million. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the fair value of the FLIR trademark are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rate. Although the FLIR sales forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results of the FLIR business. Changes in sales forecast estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. The royalty rate was driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying FLIR business, and the royalty rate assumption was consistent with assumptions used by the Company as part of the purchase price allocation of FLIR in 2021. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. Although no impairment exists for the FLIR trademark, a non-cash impairment of the trademark could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in determining the fair value of the trademark, changes to customer spending priorities, or a sharp increase in interest rates without a corresponding increase in future net sales. 
 For all indefinite-lived trademarks, including the FLIR trademark, there have been no events or changes in circumstances which indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the trademark is below its carrying value. As such, no interim impairment review was required. The Company will perform its annual analysis during the fourth quarter of 2024.

The Company s bank credit agreements requires it to comply with various financial and operating covenants and at September 29, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company made a million debt maturity payment on the Senior Notes due April 2024. 
 Teledyne estimates the fair value of its long-term debt based on debt of similar type, rating and maturity and at comparable interest rates. The Company estimates the fair value of long-term debt by using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy which is based on observable market data. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair values of our borrowings were million and million, respectively, and the carrying values were million and million, respectively.

Income (loss) before income taxes Effective tax rate ) 
 (a) The third quarter of 2024 includes net discrete income tax benefits of million and the first nine months of 2024 includes net discrete income tax benefits of million, respectively, with the income tax benefits primarily related to the release of a net income tax reserve liability (including applicable interest and penalties) as a result of a favorable resolution reached by the Company with foreign tax authorities around transfer pricing between certain FLIR subsidiaries. The third quarter of 2023 includes net discrete income tax benefits of million and the first nine months of 2023 includes net discrete income tax benefits of million, respectively. 
 Numerous foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation to adopt a minimum effective tax rate described in the Global Anti-Base Erosion, or Pillar Two, model rules issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ). A minimum effective tax rate of 15 would apply to multinational companies with consolidated revenue above 750 million. 
 Under the Pillar Two rules, a company is required to determine a combined effective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under the Pillar Two is less than 15 , a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15 . The Company is continuing to monitor the implementation of Pillar Two by individual countries and the potential effects of Pillar Two on our business. The Company does not expect the provisions effective in 2024 will have a materially adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA levies a 1 excise tax on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. If the Company were to repurchase shares, the excise tax would be recorded as a cost of acquiring treasury stock and is not material. Additionally, the IRA imposes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect the CAMT to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.

 Effect of dilutive securities (primarily stock options) Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the Company excluded approximately million of stock options in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 In April 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to billion of Teledyne s common stock. This authorization superseded prior open stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. The newly authorized stock repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or via an accelerated stock repurchase program. Shares could be repurchased in a plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The repurchase program is expected to remain open continuously, and the number of shares purchased will depend on a variety of factors, such as share price, levels of cash available, acquisitions and alternative investment opportunities available immediately or longer-term, and other regulatory, market or economic conditions. The Company currently intends to fund future share repurchases with cash on hand and available borrowings under the Company's credit facility. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased approximately million shares for million with a weighted-average price of per share. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company repurchased approximately million shares for million with a weighted-average price of per share.

 All derivative instruments are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. 
 Designated Hedging Activities 
 For a derivative instrument designated as an accounting hedge of an anticipated transaction (a cash flow hedge), the change in the fair value is recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in AOCI to the extent the derivative instrument is effective in mitigating the exposure related to the anticipated transaction.

 million, of which million is included in current accrued liabilities. At December 31, 2023, the Company s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled million. The Company evaluates whether it may be able to recover a portion of future costs for environmental liabilities from its insurance carriers and from third parties. The timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site, including the nature and extent of contamination, the number of potentially responsible parties, the timing of regulatory approvals, the complexity of the investigation and remediation, and the standards for remediation. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over many years and will complete remediation of all sites with which it has been identified in up to years. 
 Legal Matters 
 The Company is working to resolve a civil investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice relating to an ejection seat sequencer program and deliveries to the U.S. Government between 2006 and 2018. A number of other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to product liability, acquisitions, patent infringement, contracts, employment and employment benefits. While the outcome of litigation, claims, proceedings and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these matters may be determined adversely to the Company, management does not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 Teledyne provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets that require advanced technology and high reliability. These markets include aerospace and defense, factory automation, air and water quality environmental monitoring, electronics design and development, oceanographic research, deepwater oil and gas exploration and production, medical imaging and pharmaceutical research. Our products include digital imaging sensors, cameras and systems within the visible, infrared and X-ray spectra, monitoring and control instrumentation for marine and environmental applications, harsh environment interconnects, electronic test and measurement equipment, aircraft information management systems, and defense electronics and satellite communication subsystems. We also supply engineered systems for defense, space, environmental and energy applications. We differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer- and Company-sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise. We believe our technological capabilities, innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our four business segments: Digital Imaging, Instrumentation, Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems. The markets in which we sell our enabling technologies are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized. We intend to strengthen and expand our business with targeted acquisitions and through product development. We continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and stock repurchases. We aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings by emphasizing cost containment and evaluating cost reductions in all aspects of our business. At Teledyne, operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire. Using complementary technology across our businesses and through targeted research and development, we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets. We continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy. 
 Consistent with our strategy, we completed two acquisitions each in 2024 and in 2023. The financial results of the completed acquisitions have been included since the respective date of each acquisition. 
 Trends Affecting Our Business and Other Matters 
 We had previously assumed no full year sales growth in industrial automation markets as well as electronic test and measurement markets. Those markets weakened more than planned in the first half of the year, however, we believe those markets have stabilized or are beginning to recover. 
 Sales recorded and costs incurred recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. See Note 13 for additional discussion around our derivative instruments and hedging activities used to mitigate these impacts. 
 To date, we have not been materially impacted by the conflict in Israel and its effect on neighboring regions. We do not have material assets in Israel. Our total net sales to Israel in the first nine months of 2024 and the full year 2023 were approximately 1 of total net sales, respectively. It is too early to determine the full extent of the impact this conflict could have on our business and our operations, including the impact to our suppliers from these regions, and our assessment of the potential impacts is ongoing. 
 As part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance, we may take and have taken actions to consolidate and relocate certain facilities and reduce headcount across various businesses, reducing our exposure to weaker end markets. We continue to seek cost reductions in our businesses.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, and debt service requirements, as well as acquisitions. We may deploy cash for the stock repurchase program. It is anticipated that cash on hand, operating cash flow, together with available borrowings under our 1.20 billion credit facility, will be sufficient to meet these requirements. To support acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital. No cash pension contributions have been made since 2013 or are planned for the remainder of 2024 for the domestic qualified pension plans. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 561.0 million at September 29, 2024 compared with 648.3 million at December 31, 2023. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money-market mutual funds with maturities of three months or less when purchased. 
 Long-term Debt 
 Total debt at September 29, 2024 was 2,798.0 million compared with 3,244.9 million at December 31, 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, we made a 450 million debt maturity payment on the Senior notes due April 2024. 
 At September 29, 2024, 1,171.1 million was available under the 1.20 billion credit facility, after reductions of 28.9 million in outstanding letters of credit. 
 Our bank credit agreements, which includes our 1.20 billion credit facility expiring June 2029 and our 150.0 million term loan due October 2024, require us to comply with various financial and operating covenants. At September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 Our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of off-balance sheet financial arrangements. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose entities or unconsolidated entities. 
 We may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

 Stock Repurchases 
 In April 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 1.25 billion of our common stock. This authorization superseded prior open stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. The newly authorized stock repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or via an accelerated stock repurchase program. Shares could be repurchased in a plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The repurchase program is expected to remain open continuously, and the number of shares purchased will depend on a variety of factors, such as share price, levels of cash available, acquisitions and alternative investment opportunities available immediately or longer-term, and other regulatory, market or economic conditions. We currently intend to fund future share repurchases with cash on hand and available borrowings under our credit facility. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares for 332.6 million with a weighted-average price of 397.14 per share. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares for 21.4 million with a weighted-average price of 445.85 per share. 
 Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 859.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 671.7 million, driven primarily by stronger working capital conversion in the first nine months of 2024, including stronger account receivable collection and higher contract liabilities from customer advances. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 178.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 127.3 million. During the first nine months of 2024, we spent 123.7 million on acquisitions as compared with 53.5 million. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 54.7 million and 74.7 million, respectively. We currently plan to invest approximately 100 million for capital expenditures in 2024. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 772.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with net cash used in financing activities of 665.7 million, with the first nine months of 2024 including a 450 million debt maturity payment on the Senior Notes due April 2024, and share repurchases of 332.6 million. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company repaid 125.0 million of amounts outstanding on its credit facility, the 300.0 million Fixed Rate Senior Notes due April 2023, and the remaining 245.0 million on its term loan due May 2026. The Company also repurchased and retired 10.0 million of its Fixed Rate Senior Notes due April 2031, recording a 1.6 million non-cash gain on the extinguishment of this debt. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our critical accounting policies are the following: accounting for revenue recognition; accounting for business combinations, goodwill, and acquired intangible assets; and accounting for income taxes. 
 For additional discussion of the application of the critical accounting policies and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the condensed consolidated Financial Statements and also Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Teledyne s 2023 Form 10-K.

 Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
 From time to time we make, and this report contains, forward looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, directly or indirectly relating to sales, sales growth, earnings, operating margin, growth opportunities, acquisitions, product sales, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, pension matters, stock-based compensation expense, the credit facility, interest expense, severance, relocation and facility consolidation costs, environmental remediation costs, taxes, exchange rate fluctuations and strategic plans. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate , project , predict , believe or expect , that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All statements made in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other sections of this Form 10-Q that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking. 
 Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Many factors could change anticipated results, including: changes in relevant tax and other laws; foreign currency exchange risks; rising interest rates; risks associated with indebtedness, as well as our ability to reduce indebtedness and the timing thereof; the impact of semiconductor and other supply chain shortages; higher inflation, including wage competition and higher shipping costs; labor shortages and competition for skilled personnel; the inability to develop and market new competitive products; inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of financial statements and the providing of estimates of financial measures, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and related standards; disruptions in the global economy; the ongoing conflict in Israel and neighboring regions, including related protests, attacks on defense contractors and suppliers and the disruption to global shipping routes; the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including the impact to energy prices and availability, especially in Europe; customer and supplier bankruptcies; changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics, instrumentation, digital imaging, energy exploration and production, commercial aviation, semiconductor and communications markets; funding, continuation and award of government programs; cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures or changes to U.S. and foreign government spending and budget priorities triggered by inflation, rising interest costs, and economic conditions; impacts from the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union; uncertainties related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential election; the imposition and expansion of, and responses to, trade sanctions and tariffs; the continuing review and resolution of FLIR s trade compliance and tax matters; escalating economic and diplomatic tension between China and the United States; threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information, including cybersecurity threats; risks related to artificial intelligence; natural and man-made disasters, including those related to or intensified by climate change; and our ability to achieve emission reduction targets and decrease our carbon footprint. Lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as instability in the Middle East or other oil producing regions, and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production, including those implemented in response to climate change, could further negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry. Weakness in the commercial aerospace industry negatively affects the markets of our commercial aviation businesses. The recent machinist strike at Boeing as well as the ongoing issues with Boeing s 737 MAX product line could result in manufacturing delays and lower sales of our products to Boeing. In addition, financial market fluctuations affect the value of the company s pension assets. Changes in the policies of U.S. and foreign governments, including economic sanctions, could result, over time, in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates. 
 While our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as, among others, our ability to integrate acquired businesses, retain key management and customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies. There are additional risks associated with acquiring, owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations. 
 We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 
 Readers are urged to read our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more complete description of our company, its businesses, its strategies and the various risks that we face. Various risks are identified in our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation and assistance of other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 29, 2024, are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 In connection with our evaluation during the quarterly period ended September 29, 2024, we have made no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
