No pre-existing relationships existed between the Company and ICOR prior to the acquisition. ICOR revenue and cost of goods sold are included in the Product segment from the date of acquisition. The acquisition is not expected to be material to our operations, and consequently we have not included any pro-forma information. As part of the ICOR acquisition, the purchase agreement with respect to the acquisition provided for the payment of contingent consideration of up to CDN (approximately based upon future cumulative net sales during the three-year period ended January 9, 2027. Using a Monte-Carlo pricing model, the Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration to be as of January 9, 2024. Significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation include a discount rate of . The contingent consideration liability is remeasured at the estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized within operating income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for such period. We measure the initial liability and remeasure the liability on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. As the contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair value each reporting period, significant increases or decreases in projected sales, discount rates or the time until payment is made could have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. Our determination of fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities could change in future periods based on our ongoing evaluation of these significant unobservable inputs. The following table summarizes the changes in the contingent consideration liability for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 : Fair value adjustment Foreign currency translation adjustments ) Balance, March 31, 2024 Fair value adjustment Foreign currency translation adjustments ) Balance, June 30, 2024 Fair value adjustment Foreign currency translation adjustments Balance, September 30, 2024 Alpha Safety Acquisition On February 29, 2024, Safariland, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Alpha Safety Intermediate, LLC Alpha Safety , a provider of highly engineered technical products and services spanning the nuclear value chain.

Each of the Term Loan and the Revolving Loan mature on July 23, 2026. Commencing December 31, 2021, the Term Loan requires scheduled quarterly payments in amounts equal to per quarter of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan, with the balance due at maturity. The 2021 Credit Agreement is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors and, subject to certain exceptions, is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors pursuant to a Security and Pledge Agreement and a Guaranty and Suretyship Agreement, each dated as of the Closing Date . There were amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there were in outstanding letters of credit and of availability. The Borrower may elect to have the Revolving Loan and Term Loan under the 2021 Credit Agreement bear interest at a base rate or LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin. However, in connection with the market transition away from applicable LIBOR rates to SOFR, on May 31, 2023, the Company, the Borrowers and the Lenders entered into the third amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the Third Amendment pursuant to which the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to implement the SOFR rates.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Cadre Holdings, Inc. (D/B/A The Safariland Group) Cadre, the Company we, us and our should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of Cadre s control. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward- looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the section entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Business Cadre is a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of safety equipment and other related products for the law enforcement, first responder, military and nuclear markets . Our equipment provides critical protection to allow its users to safely and securely perform their duties and protect those around them in hazardous or life-threatening situations. Through our dedication to superior quality, we establish a direct covenant with end users that our products will perform and keep them safe when they are most needed. We sell a wide range of products including body armor, explosive ordnance disposal equipment and duty gear through both direct and indirect channels. In addition, through our owned distribution, we serve as a one-stop shop for first responders providing equipment we manufacture as well as third-party products including uniforms, optics, boots, firearms and ammunition. The majority of our diversified product offering is governed by rigorous safety standards and regulations. Demand for our products is driven by technological advancement as well as recurring modernization and replacement cycles for the equipment to maintain its efficiency, effective performance and regulatory compliance . We service the ever-changing needs of our end users by investing in research and development for new product innovation and technical advancements that continually raise the standards for safety equipment. Our target end user base includes domestic and international first responders such as state and local law enforcement, fire and rescue, explosive ordnance disposal technicians, emergency medical technicians, fishing and wildlife enforcement and departments of corrections, as well as federal agencies including the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Corrections and numerous foreign government agencies in over 100 countries . In January 2024, the Company acquired ICOR Technology Inc. ICOR for 40.4 million. In February 2024, the Company acquired Alpha Safety Intermediate, LLC Alpha Safety for 107.1 million. The following table sets forth a summary of our financial highlights for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales 109,408 125,114 391,577 357,949 Net income 3,655 11,053 23,150 29,047 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 13,525 23,731 66,335 65,128

 Net sales decreased by 15.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the cybersecurity incident that we reported in July 2024, and a subsequent, negligible cybersecurity incident that occurred in September 2024, each of which led the Company to take certain containment and mitigation measures out of an abundance of caution, resulting in some interruptions or disruptions of normal business operations for some of our facilities which temporarily impacted the Company s production and order fulfillment activities (collectively, the Cybersecurity Incidents ). This decrease was partially offset by recent acquisitions. Net sales increased by 33.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of recent acquisitions and higher demand for armor and duty gear products, partially offset by the Cybersecurity Incidents. Consequently, the Company has determined that the Cybersecurity Incidents have negatively impacted its results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, however, the Company believes that the Cybersecurity Incidents will not significantly affect its overall financial condition or results of operations. Net income decreased by 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in gross profit driven by lower productivity due to the Cybersecurity Incidents. Net income decreased by 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in gross profit driven by recent acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to recent acquisitions. Secondary Offering On March 19, 2024, the Company completed a secondary offering in which the Company issued and sold 2,200,000 shares of common stock at a price of 35.00 per share. The Company s net proceeds from the sale of shares were 72.8 million after underwriter discounts and commissions, fees and expenses of 4.2 million. On April 1, 2024, the underwriters exercised the full amount of their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 545,719 shares of common stock at a price of 35.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of 18.3 million after underwriter discounts and commissions, fees and expenses of 0.8 million. KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS Orders backlog We monitor our orders backlog, which we believe is a forward-looking indicator of potential sales. Our orders backlog for products includes all orders that have been received and are believed to be firm. Due to municipal government procurement rules, in certain cases orders included in backlog are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Consequently, our orders backlog may differ from actual future sales. Orders backlog can be helpful to investors in evaluating the performance of our business and identifying trends over time . The following table presents our orders backlog as of the periods indicated: 

(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Orders backlog 167,246 126,683 Orders comprising backlog as of a given balance sheet date are typically invoiced in subsequent periods. The majority of our products are generally processed and shipped within one to three weeks of an order being placed, though the fulfillment time for certain products, for example, explosive ordnance disposal equipment, may take three months or longer. Our orders backlog could experience volatility between periods, including as a result of customer order volumes and the speed of our order fulfilment, which in turn may be impacted by the nature of products ordered, the amount of inventory on hand and the necessary manufacturing lead time .

 Orders backlog increased by 40.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases of 35.6 million from recent acquisitions, 4.7 million from higher demand for hard goods and 3.7 million from demand for international orders in crowd control, partially offset by a reduction of 5.1 million from explosive ordinance disposal products due to large orders delivered during 2024. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In order to reflect the way our chief operating decision maker reviews and assesses the performance of the business, Cadre has determined that it has two reportable segments the Product segment and the Distribution segment. Segment information is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker, our chief executive officer, reviews the business, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. The following table presents data from our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands unless otherwise noted):

Related party expense, which ordinarily consists of rent expense related to distribution warehouses and retail stores that we lease from related parties, increased by 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 1.8 million transaction fee paid to Kanders Company, Inc., a company controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, in connection with the acquisition of Alpha Safety . Interest expense. Interest expense increased by 1.9 million, or 51.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the addition of the incremental term loan in 2024. Other income (expense), net. Other expense, net was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to Other income, net of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 26.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible executive compensation. The effective tax rate was 28.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and non-deductible executive compensation, partially offset by research and development tax credits. NON-GAAP MEASURES This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and provision for income tax. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA that excludes restructuring and transaction costs, other (income) expense, net, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation payroll tax expense, long-term incentive plan LTIP bonus, amortization of inventory step-up and contingent consideration expense as these items do not represent our core operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are performance measures that we believe are useful to investors and analysts because they illustrate the underlying financial and business trends relating to our core, recurring results of operations and enhance comparability between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is considered by our board of directors and management as an important factor in determining performance-based compensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP and are not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of performance of other companies. Investors should exercise caution in comparing our non-GAAP measures to any similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items required by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to information reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to recent acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of the Cybersecurity Incidents and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions and other commitments. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and amounts available under our revolving loans . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided from operating activities totaled 8.1 million and as of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 93.0 million. We believe that our cash flows from operations and cash on hand, and available borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities (as described below) will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the 12 months following the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our future capital requirements will depend on several factors, including future acquisitions and investments in our manufacturing facilities and equipment. We could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings; however, additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Debt As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 208.1 million and 140.1 million in outstanding debt, net of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, respectively, primarily related to the term loan facilities . 2021 Credit Agreement On August 20, 2021 (the Closing Date ), the Company refinanced its existing credit facilities and entered into a new credit agreement whereby Safariland, LLC, as borrower (the Borrower ), the Company and certain domestic subsidiaries of the Borrower, as guarantors (the Guarantors ), closed on and received funding under a credit agreement (initially entered into on July 23, 2021), pursuant to a First Amendment to Credit Agreement (collectively, the 2021 Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association PNC ), as administrative agent, and the several lenders from time to time party thereto (together with PNC, the Lenders pursuant to which the Borrower (i) borrowed 200.0 million under a term loan (the Term Loan ), and (ii) may borrow up to 100.0 million under a revolving credit facility (including up to 15.0 million for letters of credit and up to 10.0 million for swing line loans) (the Revolving Loan ). Each of the Term Loan and the Revolving Loan mature on July 23, 2026. Commencing December 31, 2021, the New Term Loan requires scheduled quarterly payments in amounts equal to 1.25 per quarter of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan, with the balance due at maturity. The 2021 Credit Agreement is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors and, subject to certain exceptions, is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors pursuant to a Security and Pledge Agreement and a Guaranty and Suretyship Agreement, each dated as of the Closing Date . There were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there were 2.1 million in outstanding letters of credit and 97.9 million of availability . The Borrower may elect to have the Revolving Loan and Term Loan under the 2021 Credit Agreement bear interest at a base rate or LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin. However, in connection with the market transition away from applicable LIBOR rates to SOFR, on May 31, 2023, the Company, the Borrowers and the Lenders entered into the third amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the Third Amendment pursuant to which the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to implement the SOFR rates. The applicable interest rates for these borrowings are, at the Company s option, either (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin between 0.50 and 1.50 or (b) a Term SOFR rate, plus a SOFR adjustment equal to 0.10 , plus an applicable margin equal to 1.50 to 2.50 . The 2021 Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on additional indebtedness, dividends, and other distributions, entry into new lines of business, use of loan proceeds, capital expenditures, restricted payments, restrictions on liens on the assets of the Borrowers or any Guarantor, transactions with affiliates, amendments to organizational documents, accounting changes, sale and leaseback transactions, dispositions, and

 mandatory prepayments in connection with certain liquidity events. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive debt covenants, which require us to: (i) maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.00, starting with the quarter ended December 31, 2021, which is to be determined for each quarter end on a trailing four quarter basis and (ii) maintain a quarterly maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.00 from the quarter ended December 31, 2021 until the quarter ended September 30, 2022, and thereafter 3.50 to 1.00, which is in each case to be determined on a trailing four quarter basis; provided that under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations, in the event of a material acquisition, we may temporarily increase the consolidated total net leverage ratio by up to 0.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters following such acquisition. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, failure to make payment on, or defaults with respect to, certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments and change of control provisions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, and after the expiration of any applicable grace period, payment of any outstanding loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be accelerated and the Lenders could foreclose on their security interests in the assets of the Borrowers and the Guarantors. As of November 4, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loan. In connection with the Borrower s acquisition of Alpha Safety on March 1, 2024, the Borrower and the Guarantors entered into an Incremental Facility Amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement, whereby the Lenders made an incremental term loan to the Borrower in the principal amount of 80.0 million for the purpose of funding the acquisition of Alpha Safety. All other material terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement remained unchanged. The foregoing description of the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to exhibits 10.15 , 10.16 and 10.17 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, exhibit 10.1 attached to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, as well as exhibit 10.1 attached to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 6, 2024, and are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein. Canadian Credit Facility On October 14, 2021, Med-Eng Holdings ULC and Pacific Safety Products Inc., the Company s Canadian subsidiaries, as borrowers (the Canadian Borrowers ), and Safariland, LLC, as guarantor (the Canadian Guarantor ), closed on a line of credit pursuant to a Loan Agreement (the Canadian Loan Agreement and a Revolving Line of Credit Note (the Note with PNC Bank Canada Branch PNC Canada ), as lender pursuant to which the Canadian Borrowers may borrow up to CDN 10.0 million under a revolving line of credit (including up to 3.0 million for letters of credit) (the Revolving Canadian Loan ). The Revolving Canadian Loan matures on July 23, 2026. The Canadian Loan Agreement is guaranteed by the Canadian Guarantor pursuant to a Guaranty and Suretyship Agreement. The Canadian Borrowers may elect to have borrowings either in United States dollars or Canadian dollars under the Canadian Loan Agreement, which will bear interest at a base rate or SOFR, in each case, plus an applicable margin, in the case of borrowings in United States dollars, or at a Canadian Prime Rate (as announced from time to time by PNC Canada) or a Canadian deposit offered rate CDOR as determined from time to time by PNC Canada in accordance with the Canadian Loan Agreement. The applicable margin for these borrowings will range from 0.50 to 1.50 per annum, in the case of base rate borrowings and Canadian Prime Rate borrowings, and 1.50 to 2.50 per annum, in the case of SOFR borrowings and CDOR borrowings. The Canadian Loan Agreement also requires the Canadian Borrowers to pay (i) an unused line fee on the unused portion of the loan commitments in an amount ranging between 0.175 and 0.25 per annum, based upon the level of the Company s consolidated total net leverage ratio, and (ii) an upfront fee equal to 0.25 of the principal amount of the Note. There were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Canadian Loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Canadian Loan Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on additional indebtedness, entry into new lines of business, entry into guarantee agreements, making of any loans or advances to, or investments in, any other person, restrictions on liens on the assets of the Canadian Borrowers and mergers, transfers of assets and acquisitions. The Canadian Loan Agreement and Note also contain customary events of default

 that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, failure to make payment on, or defaults with respect to, certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments and change of control provisions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, and after the expiration of any applicable grace period, payment of any outstanding loans under the Canadian Loan Agreement may be accelerated. As of November 4, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Canadian Loan. The foregoing description of the Canadian Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Canadian Loan Agreement, which is exhibit 10.18 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein. Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 8,066 46,260 Net cash used in investing activities (146,120) (4,042) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 142,831 (18,184) Effects of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 521 92 Change in cash and cash equivalents 5,298 24,126 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 87,691 45,286 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 92,989 69,412 Net cash provided by operating activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of 8.1 million resulted primarily from net income of 23.2 million, a 12.3 million add back to net income for depreciation and amortization, a 6.3 million add back to net income for stock-based compensation, a deduction to net income of 11.6 million for deferred income taxes and a net deduction to net income of 27.7 million for changes in operating assets and liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of 21.1 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 4.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities of 46.3 million resulted primarily from net income of 29.0 million, a 12.4 million add back to net income for depreciation and amortization, a 7.1 million add back to net income for stock-based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 3.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable of 3.4 million, an increase in inventories of 12.2 million and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of 8.6 million . Net cash used in investing activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 146.1 million of cash in investing activities, primarily consisting of 141.8 million for the acquisition of ICOR and Alpha Safety. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 4.0 million of cash in investing activities, primarily consisting of 4.2 million for purchases of property and equipment . 

 37 

Table of Contents CADRE HOLDINGS, INC. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of 142.8 million resulted primarily from proceeds from term loans of 80.0 million and proceeds from the secondary offering, including option exercise, of 91.8 million, partially offset by principal payments on term loans of 9.6 million, taxes paid in connection with employee stock transactions of 5.3 million and dividends distributed of 10.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 18.2 million of cash in financing activities, primarily consisting of principal payments on term loans of 7.5 million, taxes paid in connection with employee stock transactions of 2.7 million and dividends distributed of 9.0 million . Contractual Obligations Our long-term contractual obligations generally include our debt and related interest payments and operating and finance lease payments for our property and equipment, and are expected to be funded from cash-on-hand, cash from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities. There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of net sales and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and when the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in notes in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements are described in notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Emerging Growth Company We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As such, we are eligible for exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and an exemption from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

 38 

Table of Contents CADRE HOLDINGS, INC. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
 In addition, an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this provision of the JOBS Act. As a result, we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Therefore, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have in the past and may in the future be exposed to certain market risks, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial condition or results of operations due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. These risks are not significant to our results of operations, but they may be in the future. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. There have not been material changes in market risk exposures as of September 30, 2024. Interest rate risk Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest expense we are required to pay on our floating rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 209.1 million in outstanding floating rate debt, which bears interest at one-month SOFR (4.85 as of September 30, 2024) plus applicable margin. We entered into the Swap Agreements to convert a portion of the interest rate exposure on our floating rate debt from variable to fixed and designated them as cash flow hedges. Under the terms of the Swap Agreements, we receive payments based on the 1-month SOFR. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income is reclassified into interest expense, net as a yield adjustment as interest is either paid or received on the hedged debt. The fair value of our Swap Agreements is based upon Level 2 inputs. We have considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our Swap Agreements. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the principal amount of debt as of September 30, 2024, as well as the effect of our Swap Agreements. Further, in this sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year. On an annual basis, a change of 100 basis points in the applicable interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of 2.1 million on the principal amount of debt and a 0.8 million change in interest expense when including the effect of our Swap Agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had the following Swap Agreements (in thousands): 

Effective Date Notional Amount Fixed Rate September 30, 2021 through July 23, 2026 85,000 0.812 May 31, 2023 through July 23, 2026 46,250 3.905 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no interest rate swap agreements that expired. Foreign currency exchange rate risk Our operations are geographically diverse and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, related to our transactions and our subsidiaries balances that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our functional currency. The Company has entered into forward contracts to hedge forecasted Mexican peso denominated costs associated with our Mexican subsidiary. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges to manage foreign currency transaction risk and are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Any changes in the fair value of 

 39 

Table of Contents CADRE HOLDINGS, INC. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
 designated cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into earnings in the period the hedged item impacts earnings. Significant currency fluctuations could impact the comparability of our results of operations between periods. A 10 increase or decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar would have caused our reported net sales to increase or decrease by approximately 0.5 million and 1.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. A 10 increase or decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar would have caused our reported net income to increase or decrease by approximately 0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding unrealized gains or losses from remeasurement. A 10 increase or decrease in the value of the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar would have caused our reported net income to increase or decrease by approximately 0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, excluding unrealized gains or losses from remeasurement and the impact of cash flow hedges. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective . Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company acquired ICOR on January 9, 2024 and Alpha Safety on February 29, 2024. The Company is currently in the process of integrating the internal controls over financial reporting at these entities. Except for the continued integration of these entities, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls can prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. There are inherent limitations in all control systems, including the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
