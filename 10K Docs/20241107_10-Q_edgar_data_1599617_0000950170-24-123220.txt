The Company generally accounts for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is or less; however, these expenses are not material.

Revenue recognition is deferred to a future period until the Company completes its obligations contractually agreed with customers.

and , respectively, compared to and , respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2023. In general, the Company's effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to recurring items, such as differing tax rates on income earned in foreign jurisdictions, nondeductible expenses, and state income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rates were also impacted by foreign currency translation losses and other charges incurred as a result of substantially completing the liquidation of certain foreign subsidiaries with no associated tax benefit. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were higher than the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the aforementioned foreign currency translation losses and other charges with no associated tax benefit as well as realization of deferred tax assets that had a corresponding release of valuation allowance in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, that did not recur in the corresponding periods in 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has returned to recording income tax expense for interim periods based on the estimated annual effective tax rate method. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., various states, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has significant operations in the U.S. and Canada and to a lesser extent in various other international jurisdictions.

These solutions allow us to leverage the infrastructure of our SAP Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system and other technologies to streamline our customers purchasing process, from requisition to procurement to payment, by digitally managing workflow, improving approval routing and providing robust reporting functionality. 
 We support land and offshore operations for the major oil and gas producing regions around the world through our network of locations. Our key markets, beyond North America, include South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Central Asia and West and North Africa. Products sold through our locations support greenfield expansion upstream capital projects, midstream infrastructure and transmission and MRO consumables used in day-to-day production. We provide downstream energy and industrial products for petroleum refining, chemical processing, liquefied natural gas LNG terminals, power generation utilities and customer on-site locations. 
 Our supplier network consists of thousands of vendors in approximately 40 countries. From our operations, we sell to customers operating in approximately 80 countries. The supplies and equipment stocked by each of our branches are customized to meet varied and changing local customer demands. The breadth and scale of our offering enhances our value proposition to our customers, suppliers and shareholders. 
 15 

We employ advanced information technologies, including a common ERP platform across most of our business, to provide complete procurement, warehouse and inventory management and logistics coordination to our customers around the globe. Having a common ERP platform allows immediate visibility into our inventory assets, operations and financials worldwide, enhancing decision making and efficiency. 
 Demand for our products is driven primarily by the level of oil and gas drilling, completions, servicing, production, transmission, refining and petrochemical activities. It is also influenced by the global supply and demand for energy, the economy in general and geopolitics. Several factors drive spending, such as investment in energy infrastructure, the North American conventional and shale plays, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and non-OPEC supply and investments, market expectations of future developments in the oil, natural gas, liquids, refined products, petrochemical, plant maintenance and other industrial, manufacturing and energy sectors. 
 We have expanded, through acquisitions and organic investments, in Australia, Canada, England, Kuwait, Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates UAE and the United States U.S. ). 
 Summary of Reportable Segments 
 We operate through three reportable segments: U.S., Canada and International. The segment data included in our Management s Discussion and Analysis are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 9 Business Segments of the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) is also presented on this basis. 
 United States 
 We have approximately 110 locations in the U.S., which are geographically positioned to best serve the upstream, midstream, downstream, renewable energy and industrial markets. 
 We offer higher value solutions in key product lines in the U.S. which broaden and deepen our customer relationships and related product line value. Examples of these include artificial lift, pumps, valves and valve actuation, process and production equipment, fluid transfer products, measurement and controls, spoolable and coated steel pipe and composite pipe, along with many other products required by our customers, which enable them to focus on their core business while we manage varying degrees of their supply chain. We also provide additional value to our customers through the engineering, design, construction, assembly, fabrication and optimization of products and equipment essential to the safe and efficient production, transportation and processing of oil and gas. 
 Canada 
 We have a network of approximately 40 locations in the Canadian oilfield, predominantly in the oil rich provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and other targeted locations across the country. Our Canada segment primarily serves energy exploration, production, mining and drilling businesses, offering customers many of the same products and value-added solutions that we perform in the U.S. In Canada, we also provide training for, and supervise the installation of, jointed and spoolable composite pipe. This product line is supported by inventory, as well as product and installation expertise to serve our customers. 
 International 
 We serve the needs of our international customers from approximately 15 locations outside the U.S. and Canada, which are strategically located in major oil and gas development areas. Our approach in these markets is similar to our approach in North America, as our customers turn to us to provide products and supply chain solutions support closer to their drilling and exploration activities. Our long legacy of operating in many international regions, combined with expansion into several key markets, provides a competitive advantage as few of our competitors have a presence in most of the global energy producing regions. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we began a plan to restructure operations in the International segment to optimize locations to improve operating margins. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 8 million in charges, including approximately 5 million of foreign currency translation losses included in impairment and other charges, approximately 2 million of inventory write-downs included in cost of products and 1 million of other exit costs included in warehousing, selling and administrative. We could incur additional non-cash foreign currency translation losses as we complete the International restructuring; however we do not expect the remaining restructuring related liabilities to be material.

Basis of Presentation 
 The unaudited consolidated financial information included in this report has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP for interim financial information and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary are fully consolidated with the equity held by the outside stockholders and their portion of net income (loss) reflected as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The principles for interim financial information do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Company's management, the consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
 Operating Environment Overview 
 Our results are dependent on, among other factors, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and completions, well remediation activity, crude oil and natural gas prices, capital spending by oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and the worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 and the second quarter of 2024 include the following:

Executive Summary 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated net income attributable to DNOW Inc. of 13 million and 58 million on 606 million and 1,802 million in revenue, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased 18 million or 3.1 and 36 million or 2.0 , respectively, and net income attributable to DNOW Inc. declined 22 million and 42 million, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated an operating profit of 23 million and 84 million, respectively, compared to an operating profit of 37 million and 108 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2023. 
 Outlook 
 Our outlook for the Company remains tied to crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, global oil and gas drilling and completions activity, oil and gas spending, and global demand for oil, its refined petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production and decline rates. Crude oil and natural gas prices as well as crude oil and natural gas storage levels are primary catalysts for determining customer activity. In recent years, oil prices have remained volatile and economic uncertainty continues to drive commodity price volatility globally. Despite lower North American rig count resulting from enhancements in technology leading to increased rig efficiencies, we maintain a constructive outlook for our market. Amid these dynamics, we will continue to support our customers, optimize our operations, advance our strategic goals and manage the Company based on market conditions. 
 We see the evolution in energy transition investments to reduce atmospheric carbon, source carbon capture, storage and new energy streams as an opportunity for DNOW to supply many of the current products and services we provide, as well as an opportunity to partner and source from new suppliers to expand our offering and to meet our customers needs for their energy evolution investments. A number of our larger customers are leading the investments in energy evolution projects where we expect to continue to support them while expanding our product and solution offerings to meet their changing requirements. We are also targeting new customers that are not traditional oil and gas customers, but are those that will play a part in the future as our customers discover and invest in new sources of energy.

United States 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was 482 million and 1,429 million, an increase of 34 million or 7.6 and 98 million or 7.4 , respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increases were primarily driven by incremental revenue from an acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by the weakening in U.S. drilling and completions activity. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. generated an operating profit of 25 million and 76 million, a decline of 4 million and 5 million, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating profit decreased primarily due to an increase in expenses related to an acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by the increase in revenue discussed above. 
 19 

Canada 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was 65 million and 187 million, a decline of 3 million or 4.4 and 30 million or 13.8 , respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases were primarily driven by weaker project activity, coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Canada generated an operating profit of 3 million and 8 million, a decline of 3 million and 9 million, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating profit decreased primarily due to the decline in revenue discussed above. 
 International 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was 59 million and 186 million, a decrease of 13 million or 18.1 and 32 million or 14.7 , respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases were primarily driven by weaker project activity. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the International segment generated an operating loss of 5 million and nil, a decline of 7 million and 10 million, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating profit decreased primarily due to an increase in expense of 8 million related to the restructuring plan in the International segment. 
 Cost of products 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of products was 471 million and 1,400 million, respectively, compared to 454 million and 1,361 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increases were primarily due to the increase in revenue in the period. Cost of products includes the cost of inventory sold and items, such as vendor consideration, inventory allowances, amortization of intangibles and inbound and outbound freight. 
 Warehousing, selling and administrative expenses 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, warehousing, selling and administrative expenses were 107 million and 313 million, respectively, compared to 97 million and 297 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increases were primarily driven by an increase in expenses related to an acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2024. Warehousing, selling and administrative expenses include branch location, distribution center and regional expenses (including costs such as compensation, benefits and rent) as well as corporate general selling and administrative expenses. 
 Impairment and other charges 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, impairment and other charges were 5 million in both periods, compared to nil for the corresponding periods of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately 5 million of foreign currency translation losses as a result of substantially completing the liquidation of certain foreign subsidiaries in the International segment. 
 Other income (expense) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded expense of 1 million and income of nil, respectively, compared to expense of nil and 1 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the improvements were primarily attributable to an increase in interest income. 
 Income tax provision 
 The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 40.9 and 29.8 , respectively, compared to 5.4 and 5.6 , respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2023. In general, the Company's effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to recurring items, such as differing tax rates on income earned in foreign jurisdictions, nondeductible expenses and state income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rates were also impacted by foreign currency translation losses and other charges incurred as a result of substantially completing the liquidation of certain foreign subsidiaries with no associated tax benefit. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were higher than the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the aforementioned foreign currency translation losses and other charges with no associated tax benefit as well as realization of deferred tax assets that had a corresponding release of valuation allowance in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that did not recur in the corresponding periods in 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Reconciliation 
 In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations as determined by GAAP, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures. The primary non-GAAP financial measure we disclose is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding other costs EBITDA excluding other costs ). This financial measure excludes the impact of certain amounts and is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure, to its most comparable GAAP financial measure, is included below. 
 We use EBITDA excluding other costs internally to evaluate and manage the Company s operations because we believe it provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company s ongoing operating performance. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform more meaningful comparisons of operating results. 
 The following table sets forth the reconciliations of EBITDA excluding other costs to the most comparable GAAP financial measures in millions ):

(1) We believe that net income attributable to DNOW Inc. is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that is most directly comparable to EBITDA excluding other costs. EBITDA excluding other costs measures the Company s operating performance without regard to certain expenses. EBITDA excluding other costs is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP and the Company s computation of EBITDA excluding other costs may vary from others in the industry. EBITDA excluding other costs has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP. 

(2) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Other was primarily related to the International restructuring charges of 8 million , of which approximately 5 million of foreign currency translation losses included in impairment and other charges, approximately 2 million of inventory write-downs included in cost of products and 1 million of other exit costs included in warehousing, selling and administrative; additionally, Other also included transaction-related charges of approximately 2 million recorded in warehousing, selling and administrative. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other included the International restructuring charges of 8 million mentioned above as well as transaction-related charges of approximately 10 million, of which 5 million were included in cost of products and approximately 5 million included in warehousing, selling and administrative. Transaction-related charges include transaction costs, inventory fair value step-up, retention bonus accruals and integration expenses associated with acquisitions. 
 (3) EBITDA excluding other costs is defined as EBITDA excluding other costs divided by Revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. We expect resources to be available to reinvest in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to meet short and long-term objectives. We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from expected results of operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations, anticipated working capital needs and other cash requirements, including capital expenditures and our share repurchase program. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 261 million and 299 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 89 million of our cash and cash equivalents were maintained in the accounts of our various foreign subsidiaries. During the first nine months of 2024, we repatriated 3 million from our foreign subsidiaries. The Company makes a determination each period concerning its intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest the cash held by its foreign subsidiaries. The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings that it considers to be indefinitely reinvested. Future changes to our indefinite reinvestment assertion could result in additional taxes (withholding and/or state taxes), offset by any available foreign tax credits. 
 We maintain a 500 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility that will mature on December 14, 2026. Availability under the revolving credit facility is determined by a borrowing base comprised of eligible receivables, eligible inventory and certain cash deposits in the U.S. and Canada. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility, and had approximately 493 million in availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) resulting in the excess availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 99 , subject to certain restrictions. Availability excluding certain cash deposits was approximately 361 million. Borrowings that result in the excess availability dropping below the greater of 10 of the borrowing base or 40 million are conditioned upon compliance with or waiver of a minimum fixed charge ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type including financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. We continuously monitor compliance with debt covenants. A default, if not waived or amended, would prevent us from taking certain actions, such as incurring additional debt. 
 We are often party to certain transactions that require off-balance sheet arrangements such as standby letters of credit and performance bonds and guarantees that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These arrangements are made in our normal course of business and they are not reasonably likely to have a current or future material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. 
 The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):

Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 176 million compared to 83 million provided by operating activities in the corresponding period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities comprised of 59 million of net income; plus 75 million of reconciling adjustments, primarily depreciation, amortization, and deferred income taxes; and a net decrease of 42 million in working capital. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the improvement was primarily driven by improved inventory efficiency and better collections. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 190 million compared to 47 million used in investing activities in the corresponding period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to business acquisitions of 185 million, net of cash acquired. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 25 million compared to 54 million used in financing activities in the corresponding period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to the Company's payment of 18 million for share repurchases compared to 49 million for the corresponding period of 2023. 
 22 

Other 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effect of the change in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents was 1 million favorable compared to nil for the corresponding period of 2023. 
 Capital Spending 
 We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and the usage of the available portion of the revolving credit facility. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at terms acceptable to us. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On August 3, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to 80 million of its outstanding common stock through December 31, 2024. We expect to fund share repurchases primarily with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and the usage of the available portion of the revolving credit facility. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be made at our discretion, taking into account a number of factors, including market conditions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,379,020 shares of our common stock for a total of approximately 18 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 6 million remaining under the program s authorization, excluding 1 excise tax, as enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 For a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In preparing the financial statements, the Company makes assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. The Company periodically evaluates its estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature, which are related to allowance for credit losses, inventory reserves, purchase price allocation of acquisitions and income taxes. Its estimates are based on historical experience and on its future expectations that the Company believes are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material. 
 23 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. We do not currently have any material outstanding derivative instruments. See Note 14 Derivative Financial Instruments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 A discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We have operations in foreign countries and transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our net assets as well as our revenues and costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Because we operate globally and approximately one-fifth of our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were outside the U.S., foreign currency exchange rates can impact our financial position, results of operations and competitive position. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. As of September 30, 2024, our most significant foreign currency exposure was to the Canadian dollar, followed by the British pound, with less significant foreign currency exposure to the Australian dollar. 
 The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities, while revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are components of other comprehensive income (loss) as reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of a foreign subsidiary, the accumulated translation gains and losses relating to the foreign subsidiary are reclassified into earnings, reflected in impairment and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net foreign currency translation gain of 4 million, after the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation losses of approximately 5 million related to the substantial liquidation of certain foreign subsidiaries in our International segment. 
 Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations generally do not materially affect our earnings since the functional currency is typically the local currency; however, our operations also have net assets not denominated in their functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact our net income as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported foreign currency transaction losses of 1 million in both periods. Gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and fair value adjustments to economically hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Some of the revenues for our foreign operations are denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly, some of our revenues for our foreign operations are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate those risks, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of the revenues and the associated costs. Although we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated balances or transactions, we do not currently hedge the net investments in our foreign operations. The counterparties to our forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored by us on a continuing basis. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential. 
 The average foreign exchange rate for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the average for the corresponding period of 2023 remained flat compared to the U.S. dollar based on the aggregated weighted average revenue of our foreign-currency denominated foreign operations. The Canadian dollar and Australian dollar each decreased in relation to the U.S. dollar by 1 , while the British pound increased in relation to the U.S dollar by approximately 3 . 
 We utilized a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact on earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency rates. A 10 change from the levels experienced during the first nine months of 2024 of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affected the Company would have resulted in approximately 1 million change in net income for the same period. 
 Commodity Steel Pricing 
 Our business is sensitive to steel prices, which can impact our product pricing, with steel tubular prices generally having the highest degree of sensitivity. While we cannot predict steel prices, we mitigate this risk by managing our inventory levels, including maintaining sufficient quantity on hand to meet demand, while limiting the risk of overstocking.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
