 Time charter in contracts 
 
 The Company charters in vessels to supplement its owned fleet to support its voyage charter operations. The Company hires vessels under time charters with third party vessel owners, and recognizes the charter hire payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the charter. Charter hire payments are typically made in advance, and the unrecognized portion is reflected as advance hire in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the time charters, the vessel owner is responsible for the vessel operating costs such as crews, maintenance and repairs, insurance, and stores. As allowed by a practical expedient under ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842"), the Company made an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset for leases with a term of 12 months or less, to forego recognizing a right-of-use asset and lease liability on its balance sheet. For the quarter ending September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any time charter in contracts with terms greater than 12 months, as such charter hire expense presented on the consolidated statements of income are lease expenses for chartered in contracts less than 12 months.

vessels chartered to customers under time charters that contained a lease. These leases varied in original length from days to days. The lease payments due under these arrangements totaled approximately and each of the time charters were due to be completed in days or less. 
 
 At September 30, 2023, the Company had two vessels chartered to customers under time charters that included a lease. These two leases varied in original length from 30 days to 32 days. The lease payments due under this arrangement totaled approximately and each time charter was due to be completed in days or less. 
 
 The Company does not have any sales-type or direct financing leases. 
 
 Office leases 
 
 The Company has non-cancelable office and office equipment leases. The resulting lease assets and liabilities are not material. 
 
 Ground Lease 
 
 The company entered into a 10-year ground lease agreement with the Tampa Port Authority, commencing on April 22, 2024. According to ASC 842, this lease will be accounted for as a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The initial measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability will be based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 In a voyage charter contract, the charterer hires the vessel to transport a specific agreed-upon cargo for a single voyage, which may contain multiple load ports and discharge ports. The consideration in such a contract is determined on the basis of a freight rate per metric ton of cargo carried or occasionally on a lump sum basis. The charter party generally has a minimum amount of cargo. The charterer is liable for any short loading of cargo or "dead" freight. The voyage contract generally has standard payment terms of 95 freight paid within three days after completion of loading. The voyage charter party generally has a "demurrage" or "despatch" clause. As per this clause, the charterer reimburses the Company for any delays that exceed the agreed to laytime at the ports visited, with the amounts recorded as demurrage revenue. Conversely, the charterer is given credit if the loading/discharging activities happen within the allowed laytime which is known as despatch and results in a reduction of revenue. In a voyage charter contract, the performance obligations begin to be satisfied once the vessel begins loading the cargo. The Company determined that its voyage charter contracts consist of a single performance obligation of transporting the cargo within a specified time period. Therefore, the performance obligation is met evenly as the voyage progresses, and the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the voyage days from the commencement of the loading of cargo to completion of discharge. 
 
 The voyage contracts are considered service contracts which fall under the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers because the Company, as the shipowner, retains control over the operations of the vessel such as directing the routes taken or the vessel speed. The voyage contracts generally have variable consideration in the form of demurrage or despatch. 
 
 During time charter agreements, the Company is paid to provide transportation services on a per day basis for a specified period of time. Revenues from time charters are earned and recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the charter, the charterers have substantive decision-making rights to direct how and for what purpose the vessel is used. As such, the Company has identified that time charter agreements contain a lease in accordance with ASC 842. Revenue is not earned when vessels are offhire. 
 
 In a stevedore service contract, the Company is paid to provide cargo handling services on a per unit basis for a specified quantity of cargo. The consideration in such a contract is determined on the basis of a rate per unit of cargo handled. The contract

Long-lived Assets Impairment Considerations 
 
 The Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If indicators of impairment are present, we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the related long-lived assets. Our assessment is made at the asset group level, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets. The asset groups established by the Company are defined by vessel size and major characteristic or trade. 
 
 The Company concluded that no triggering event had occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which would require impairment testing. 
 
 The Company concluded that no triggering event had occurred during the third quarter of 2023, which would require impairment testing. However, during the first quarter of 2023, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred related to the sale of a vessel, as its carrying value exceeded its fair value. On January 18, 2023, the Company signed a memorandum of agreement to sell the m/v Bulk Newport for 8.9 million in net consideration after brokerage commissions. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on sale of 1.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. The Company performed an impairment analysis on each asset group and concluded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were higher than their carrying amounts and as such, no additional loss on impairment was recognized.

 Bulk Friendship Corp. Bareboat Charter Party 
 
 In September 2024, Bulk Friendship Corp. entered into a sale and leaseback arrangement for 8.0 million. Under ASC 606, the transaction did not qualify as a sale, as control of the vessel was not transferred to the lessor. Consequently, the lease is classified as a finance lease in accordance with ASC 842, due to the inclusion of a fixed-price purchase option, which the Company expects to exercise. The minimum lease payments consist of a fixed component of 50,000 per month and a floating component based on one-month SOFR plus a margin of 1.9 . The Company has the option to purchase the vessel after the 18th month or at any point upon lessor default. If not exercised earlier, a final purchase option allows the Company to acquire the vessel at the end of the five-year term for 5 million.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto contained in this report. 
 
 Forward Looking Statements 
 
 All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward looking statements. When used in this Form 10-Q, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors and other factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 
 
 Important Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts 
 
 The Company uses a variety of financial and operational terms and concepts when analyzing its performance. 
 
 These include revenue recognition, deferred revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, vessels and depreciation and long-lived assets impairment considerations, as defined above as well as the following: 
 
 Voyage Revenue. Voyage revenue is derived from voyage charters which involve the carriage of cargo from a load port to a discharge port, which is predetermined in each voyage contract. Gross revenue is calculated by multiplying the agreed rate per ton of cargo by the number of tons loaded. The Company directs how and for what purpose the vessel is used and therefore, these voyage contracts do not contain leases. 
 
 Charter Revenue. Charter revenue is earned when the Company lets a vessel it owns or operates to a charterer for a specified period of time. Charter revenue is based on the agreed rate per day. These time-charter arrangements contain leases because the lessee has the power to direct the use and receives substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the vessel. The operating lease component and the vessel operating expense non-lease component of a time-charter contract are reported as a single component. 
 
 Terminal Stevedore Revenue. Terminal Stevedore revenue is derived from inbound and outbound cargo handling services at ports which the Company operates in. Gross revenue is earned typically based on a per-unit rate for volumes handled. 
 
 Voyage Expenses. The Company incurs expenses for voyage charters, including bunkers (fuel), port charges, canal tolls, brokerage commissions and cargo handling operations, which are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Charter Expenses. The Company charters in vessels to supplement its owned fleet to support its voyage charter operations. The Company hires vessels under time charters with third party vessel owners, and recognizes the charter hire payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the charter. Charter hire payments are typically made in advance, and the unrecognized portion is reflected as advance hire in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the time charters, the vessel owner is responsible for the vessel operating costs such as crews, maintenance and repairs, insurance, and stores. The Company does not record a right-of-use asset or lease liability for any arrangement less than one year. 
 
 Vessel Operating Expenses. Vessel operating expenses represent the cost to operate the Company s owned vessels. Vessel operating expenses include crew hire and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the cost of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes, other miscellaneous expenses, and technical management fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred. Technical management services include day-to-day vessel operations, performing general vessel maintenance, ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance, arranging the hire of crew, and purchasing stores, supplies, and spare parts. 
 
 T erminal Stevedore Expenses. Terminal Stevedore expenses represent the cost to provide the Company's cargo handling services. Terminal Stevedore expenses include direct labor and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance of shore based equipment, trucking, and other direct miscellaneous expenses. 
 24 

Fleet Data. The Company believes that the measures for analyzing future trends in its results of operations consist of the following: 
 
 Shipping days. The Company defines shipping days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which its owned or chartered-in vessels are performing either a voyage charter (voyage days) or a time charter (time charter days). 
 
 Daily vessel operating expenses. The Company defines daily vessel operating expenses as vessel operating expenses divided by ownership days for the period. Vessel operating expenses include crew hire and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes, other miscellaneous expenses, and technical management fees. 
 
 Chartered in days. The Company defines chartered in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which it chartered in vessels from third party vessel owners. 
 
 Time Charter Equivalent TCE rates . The Company defines TCE rates as total revenues less voyage expenses divided by the length of the voyage, which is consistent with industry standards. TCE rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in per-day amounts.

 (1) Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (or loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairment, loss on sale and leaseback of vessels, share-based compensation, other non-operating income and/or expense, and other non-recurring items, if any. Adjusted EBITDA is included because it is used by management and certain investors to measure operating performance and is also reviewed periodically as a measure of financial performance by Pangaea's Board of Directors. Adjusted EBITDA is not an item recognized by the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other indicator of a company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. Pangaea s definition of Adjusted EBITDA used here may not be comparable to the definition of EBITDA used by other companies. 
 
 (2) Shipping days are defined as the aggregate number of days in a period during which its owned or chartered-in vessels are performing either a voyage charter (voyage days) or time charter (time charter days).

 (3) Net transportation and service revenue represents total revenue less the total direct costs of transportation and services, which includes charter hire, voyage and vessel operating expenses and terminal stevedore expenses. Net transportation and service revenue is included because it is used by management and certain investors to measure performance by comparison to other logistic service providers. Net transportation and service revenue is not an item recognized by the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other indicator of a company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. Pangaea s definition of net transportation and service revenue used here may not be comparable to an operating measure used by other companies. 
 
 (4) Gross profit represents total revenue less cost of transportation and service revenue less vessel and terminal equipment depreciation.

Business Overview 
 
 Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Pangaea or the Company provides seaborne drybulk logistics and transportation services as well as terminal and stevedoring services. Pangaea utilizes its logistics expertise to service a broad base of industrial customers who require the transportation of a wide variety of drybulk cargoes, including grains, coal, iron ore, pig iron, hot briquetted iron, bauxite, alumina, cement clinker, dolomite and limestone. 
 
 The Company provides ocean transportation services to clients utilizing an ocean-going fleet of motor vessels ("m/v") in the Handymax, Supramax, Ultramax and Panamax and Post-Panamax segments. At any time, this fleet may be comprised of a total of 45-60 vessels that are owned or chartered-in on a short-term basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company operated a total fleet of 52 vessels, of which 26 were wholly-owned or partially-owned through joint ventures. 
 
 Industry Overview 
 
 We operate in a cyclical industry subject to macroeconomic shifts, geopolitical volatility and other factors. Our business is also subject to fluctuations in the supply and demand for vessels, together with global demand for drybulk commodities, which impact freight pricing. 
 
 The Baltic Dry Index BDI ), a broader market measure of the cost to transport drybulk commodities by sea, offers a market view into global supply demand trends and is considered the standard benchmark for drybulk cargo pricing. The BDI averaged 1,871 for the third quarter of 2024, up approximately 43 , compared to an average of 1,305 for the same quarter of 2023. The average published market rates for Supramax and Panamax vessels, reflecting the composition of the company's fleet, also increased approximately 30 , from an average of 10,548 in the third quarter of 2023 to 13,707 in the same period of 2024. As a result of the industry's volatility, we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results in the past, and we expect to continue experiencing such fluctuations in the future due to various factors, including cargo demand, vessel supply, competition, and seasonality. 
 
 Quarterly TCE Performance 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's TCE rates were up 4 to 16,324 from 15,748 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's achieved TCE rates improved from the previous quarter as the overall dry bulk market rates improved for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company's achieved TCE rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 outperformed the average of the Baltic panamax and supramax market indexes and exceeded the average market rates by approximately 19 due to its long-term contracts of affreightment, ("COAs"), its specialized fleet and its cargo-focused strategy. 
 
 3rd Quarter Highlights 
 
 Net income attributable to Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. was approximately 5.1 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 18.9 million for the same period of 2023. 
 Diluted net income per share was 0.11 for three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.42 for the same period in 2023. 
 Pangaea's TCE rates were 16,324 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 15,748 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 23.9 million and 27.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 At the end of the quarter, Pangaea had 93.1 million in cash, and cash equivalents. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Pangaea s revenues are derived predominately from voyage, time charters, and terminal and stevedore revenue. Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 153.1 million, compared to 135.6 million for the same period in 2023, a 13 increase. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 5 rise in total shipping days, reaching 4,805 days for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,610 days for the same period in 2023. However, this was partially offset by a 20 decrease in terminal and stevedore revenue. 
 
 29 

The Components of our revenue are as follows: 
 
 Voyage Revenues : Voyage revenues increased by 13 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 145.1 million compared to 127.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in voyage revenues was primarily due to a 5 increase in voyage days from 4,314 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4,549 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is also attributable to higher average TCE rates earned as discussed above. 
 
 Charter Revenues: Charter revenues increased to 4.9 million from 3.8 million, or 28 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in charter revenues was due to higher charter hire rates, with the panamax and supramax vessel index rising 30 from 10,548 per day for three months ended September 30, 2023 to 13,707 per day, over the same period of 2024. However, time charter days decreased by 13 year-over-year, from 296 days to 256 days. Our flexible chartering strategy enables the Company to selectively release excess ship days, if any, into the market under time charter arrangements rather than voyage days. 
 
 Terminal Stevedore Revenues: Terminal Stevedore revenues decreased by 20 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 3.1 million compared to 3.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the timing of certain significant customer contracts, which did not contribute to revenues in the third quarter of 2024 but are expected to be fulfilled in the fourth quarter of 2024. This timing shift of contracts that contribute materially to port revenues resulted in a decrease for the current period. 
 
 Operating and Business Expenses 
 
 In recent years, global cost inflation has contributed to higher vessel operation costs, including crew travel, equipment transportation, and drydocking. While we expect crew payroll expenses to stabilize in the near and medium term, other inflated costs may increase our vessels' daily operating expenses. Typically, any fuel cost increases during voyages are managed through bunker hedging or through fuel cost pass-through arrangements in long-term contracts. 
 
 The Components of our expenses are as follows: 
 
 Voyage Expenses: Voyage expenses were 71.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 59.1 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 21 . The increase was driven by a 5 increase in voyage days, leading to corresponding increases in bunkers consumed and port expenses incurred. The total average market price of bunkers consumed increased by 19.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Port expenses increased approximately 7 compared to the prior year as a result of the increase in voyage day activity. 
 
 Charter Hire Expenses: Charter hire expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 36.5 million, compared to 25.5 million for the same period in 2023, a 43 increase. The increase in charter hire expenses was predominantly driven by higher market rates for charter-in vessels, as well as an increase in chartered-in days. Specifically, the average published market rates for Supramax and Panamax vessels increased approximately 30 climbing from an average of 10,548 in the third quarter of 2023 to 13,707 in the same period of 2024. Chartered-in days increased 7 from 2,358 days in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,519 days for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Charter hire expenses on a per day basis were 14,494 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 10,800 for the same period in 2023. The Company's flexible charter-in strategy allows it to supplement its owned fleet with short term chartered-in tonnage at prevailing market prices, when needed, to meet cargo demand. 
 
 Vessel Operating Expenses: Vessel operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 13.9 million, compared to 14.3 million for the same period in 2023, an decrease of approximately 3 . The ownership days remained stable, with 2,293 days for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,300 days in 2023, reflecting a decrease of less than 1 . Excluding technical management fees, vessel operating expenses on a per day basis were 5,520 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from 5,706 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Technical management fees amounted to approximately 1.2 million and 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Terminal Stevedore Expenses: Terminal Stevedore expenses decreased by 31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.4 million compared to 3.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was in line with decreased terminal revenue. 
 
 30 

General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses amounted to 6.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in non-cash compensation associated with equity awards. 
 
 Unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments 
 
 The Company assesses risk associated with fluctuating future freight rates and bunker prices, and when appropriate, actively hedges identified economic risk that may impact the operating income of long-term cargo contracts and forward bookings with forward freight agreements and bunkers swaps. The utilization of such derivatives can lead to fluctuations in the Company's reported results from operations on a period-to-period basis as the Company marks these positions to market at the balance sheet date while settlement of the position and execution of the physical transaction may occur at a future date. The Company recognized a mark to market loss on bunker swaps of approximately 3.3 million and a mark to market loss on forward freight agreements (FFAs) of approximately 712.9 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value loss on interest rate derivatives amounted to approximately 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The total loss resulted from changes in the fair value of the derivatives at the respective balance sheet dates. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Pangaea s revenues are derived predominately from voyage and time charters. Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 389.4 million, compared to 367.4 million for the same period in 2023, a 6 increase. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher average TCE rates earned. The total shipping days remained stable, totaling 12,607 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12,624 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Components of revenue are as follows: 
 
 Voyage Revenues: Voyage revenues increased by 3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 356.5 million compared to 346.3 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher average TCE rates from 15,256 per day to 16,692 per day. Voyage days remained nearly unchanged, totaling 11,289 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11,283 days in 2023. 
 
 Charter Revenues: Charter revenues increased to 23.7 million from 16.6 million, or 43 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in charter revenues was due to an increase in charter hire rates earned. The time charter revenue per day was 18,011 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12,406 for the same period of 2023. Time charter days decreased 2 to 1,318 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,341 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The optionality of our chartering strategy allows the Company to selectively release excess ship days, if any, into the market under time charters arrangements. 
 
 Terminal Stevedore Revenues: Terminal Stevedore revenues increased by 105 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 9.1 million compared to 4.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributed to the acquisition of port operations on June 1, 2023, which resulted in a full nine months of revenue being recorded in 2024, compared to merely four months in 2023. 

Operating and Business Expenses 
 
 The Components of our expenses are as follows: 
 
 Voyage Expenses: Voyage expenses were 169.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 170.3 million for the same period in 2023, reflecting a decrease of less than 1 . 
 
 31 

Charter Hire Expenses: Charter hire expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 96.3 million, compared to 77.2 million for the same period in 2023, a 25 increase. The increase in charter hire expenses was primarily due to an increase in market rates to charter-in vessels. The average published market rates for Supramax and Panamax vessels increased approximately 38 from an average of 10,227 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14,161 in the same period of 2024. Meanwhile, chartered-in days remained about the same, with a slight decrease from 6,050 days in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6,025 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company's flexible charter-in strategy allowing it to supplement its owned fleet with short term chartered-in tonnage at prevailing market prices, when needed, to meet cargo demand. 
 
 Vessel Operating Expenses: Vessel operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 41.3 million, compared to 41.1 million for the same period in 2023, a slight increase of approximately 1 . Excluding technical management fees, vessel operating expenses on a per day basis were 5,686 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 5,620 for the same period in 2023. Technical management fees were approximately 3.4 million and 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Terminal Stevedore Expenses: Terminal Stevedore expenses increased by 88 to 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.9 million for the same period in 2023. This increase is attributable to the acquisition of port operations in June 2023, resulting in a full three quarters of expenses from these operations in 2024, compared to four months in the prior year. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 18.3 million, compared to 17.1 million for the same period in 2023, reflecting a marginal increase year-over-year. The increase is primarily attributable to non-cash compensation associated with equity awards. 
 
 Unrealized (loss) gain on derivative instruments 
 
 The Company assesses risk associated with fluctuating future freight rates and bunker prices, and when appropriate, actively hedges identified economic risk that may impact the operating income of long-term cargo contracts and forward bookings with forward freight agreements and bunkers swaps. The utilization of such derivatives can lead to fluctuations in the Company's reported results from operations on a period-to-period basis as the Company marks these positions to market at the balance sheet date while settlement of the position and execution of the physical transaction may occur at a future date. The Company recognized mark to market losses on bunker swaps of approximately 1.1 million and gains on forward freight agreements (FFAs) of approximately 1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value loss on interest rate derivatives was approximately 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These losses resulted from changes in the fair value of the derivatives at the respective balance sheet dates. 
 
 Significant accounting estimates 
 
 The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant estimates and assumptions of the Company are the estimated future cash flows used in its impairment analysis, the estimated salvage value used in determining depreciation expense, the estimated on the percentage completion of spot voyages and the allowances for doubtful accounts. 
 
 Long-lived Assets Impairment Considerations 
 
 The Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If indicators of impairment are present, we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the related long-lived assets. Our assessment is made at the asset group level, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets. The asset groups established by the Company are defined by vessel size and major characteristic or trade. 
 
 32 

The Company concluded that no triggering event had occurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which would require impairment testing. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, the Company determined that a triggering event occurred related to the sale of a vessel, as the carrying value exceeded its fair value. On January 18, 2023, the Company signed a memorandum of agreement to sell the m/v Bulk Newport for 8.9 million in net consideration after brokerage commissions. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on sale of 1.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. The Company performed an impairment analysis on each asset group and concluded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were higher than their carrying amounts and as such, no additional loss on impairment was recognized. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company has historically financed its capital needs through cash flow from operations, common stock issuance, non-controlling interest contributions, and long-term debt and finance leases. Capital has primarily been allocated to operations, vessel acquisitions, and debt servicing. While the Company may pursue additional debt or equity financing as needed, adverse market conditions could limit access to favorable terms, potentially restricting business expansion opportunities. 
 
 Since a significant portion of our Company's long-term debt and finance leases have fixed or capped interest rates, the impact of rising interest rates on our earnings is limited. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company s working capital was 100.3 million and 86.5 million, respectively. This increase mainly reflects strategic refinancing of secured debt and finance leases, which extended maturity dates and improved liquidity over the nine months ending September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows: 
 
 The table below summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We have derived these summarized statements of cash flows from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Amounts in the table below have been calculated based on unrounded numbers. Accordingly, certain amounts may not appear to recalculate due to the effect of rounding. 
 
 For the nine months ended (In millions) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities: Net income adjusted for non-cash items 47.9 47.7 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net (1.5) (17.8) Operating activities 46.4 29.9 Investing activities (57.4) (25.0) Financing activities 5.0 (45.9) Net change (5.9) (41.0) 
 33 

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 46.4 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 29.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash flows from operating activities compared to the previous year was primarily due to better management of working capital, including improved collections of accounts receivable and efficient timing of accounts payable. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 57.4 million compared to 25.0 million for the same period in 2023. The Company purchased two vessels for 57.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In comparison, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company (i) paid 27.0 million for the purchase of one vessel and other vessel improvements and (ii) paid 7.2 million for the net cash acquisition of a port and terminal operation. These uses of cash were partially offset by 8.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of one vessel and cash dividends of 1.6 million from equity method investments. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.0 million and net cash used in financing activities was 45.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company (i) received net proceeds of 35.2 million from long-term debt (comprised of 64.2 million in proceeds offset by 29.0 million in repayments) (ii) made a net repayment of 10.7 million in finance leases (comprised of 18.7 million in payments offset by 8.0 million in finance lease proceeds from finance leases), (iii) paid 13.9 million in cash dividends to its shareholders and 2.3 million in cash dividends to non-controlling interest holders and (iv) paid 2.0 million as payment to non-controlling interest recorded as long-term liability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company (i) repaid 12.4 million of long term debt and 12.2 million of finance leases, (ii) paid 13.6 million in cash dividends to its shareholders and 5.0 million in cash dividends to non-controlling interest holders and (iii) paid 2.5 million as payment to non-controlling interest recorded as long-term liability. 
 
 The Company has demonstrated its unique ability to adapt to changing market conditions by maintaining a nimble chartered-in profile to meet its cargo commitments. We believe, given our current cash holdings, if drybulk shipping rates do not decline significantly from current levels, our capital resources, including cash anticipated to be generated within the year, are sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 The Company s capital expenditures relate to the purchase of vessels and interests in vessels, capital improvements to its vessels which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels, as well as port terminal operations. The Company s owned or partially owned and controlled fleet at September 30, 2024 includes: nine Panamax drybulk carriers (six of which are Ice-Class 1A); nine Supramax drybulk carriers, two Ultramax Ice Class 1C, two Ultramax drybulk carriers, and four Post Panamax Ice Class 1A drybulk vessels. 
 
 In addition to vessel acquisitions that the Company may undertake in future periods, its other major capital expenditures include funding its program of regularly scheduled drydockings necessary to make improvements to its vessels, as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Funding expenses associated with these requirements will be met with cash from operations. The Company anticipates that this process of recertification will require it to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities, which will reduce the Company s available days and operating days during that period. The Company capitalized drydocking costs totaling approximately 3.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company expensed drydocking costs of approximately 233,000 and 356,000, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Subject to Section 7.02, if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first , to pay interest, fees and other amounts then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest, fees and other amounts then due to such parties, and (ii) second , to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties. 
 (c) Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the applicable Overnight Rate. 
 (d) Deductions by Administrative Agent . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(e), 2.06(b), 2.13 or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender s obligations to the Administrative Agent, until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and for application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. 
 (e) Several Obligations of Lenders . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.03(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or, as applicable, to fund any such participation or to make any such payment on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its 
 38 

applicable Loan, to purchase its participations, as applicable, or to make its payment under Section 9.03(c). 
 SECTION 2.13 Sharing of Payments . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder, as applicable, resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations, as applicable, greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders of the Loan Facility, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, as applicable provided that 
 (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest and 
 (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender, or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). 
 The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrowers rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation. 
 SECTION 2.14 Compensation for Losses . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Term SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the failure to borrow or prepay any Term SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.09(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (c) the assignment of any Term SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, in either case, as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.21(b), then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for any loss, cost and expense attributable to such event, including any loss, cost or expense arising from the liquidation or redeployment of funds or from any fees payable. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
 SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs . 
 (a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall 
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including pursuant to regulations issued from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board for determining the maximum 
 39 

reserve requirement (including any emergency, special, supplemental or other marginal reserve requirement) with respect to eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as Eurocurrency liabilities in Regulation D)), special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by or any Lender

 (iii) impose on any Lender any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or participation in any such Loan 
 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
 (c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrowers, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
 (d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

 (b) Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Obligors under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Obligor by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (e) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the relevant Obligor has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Obligors to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (A), (B) and (D) of Section 2.18(g)(ii)) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 (i) Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 SECTION 2.17 Inability to Determine Rates . With respect to any Term SOFR Loan, subject to Section 2.21, if 
 (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period or 
 (b) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for such Loan that if Term SOFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, Term SOFR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loan during the applicable Interest Period, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, 
 then, in each case, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each applicable Lender. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers, any obligation of the Lenders to make Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or the affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b), at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of the affected Term SOFR Loans or, failing that, the Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans in the 
 44 

amount specified therein, and any outstanding affected Term SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such prepayment, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.15. 
 SECTION 2.18 Illegality .

The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 (b) Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.14, Section 2.15 or Section 2.16) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) provided that 
 (i) the Borrowers shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.04 
 (ii) such Lender shall have received, as applicable, payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts

 (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter 
 (iv) such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law and 
 (v) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
 A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

 (b) Defaulting Lender Cure . If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders under the Loan Facility or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the applicable Commitments, whereupon, such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender and provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.

 103 

(c) agrees with each Secured Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify that Secured Party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of the Borrowers or any other Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Loan Document on the date when it would have been due.

 SECTION 10.04 Waiver of Defenses . The obligations of each Guarantor under this Section 10 and in respect of any security provided by or pursuant to the Security Documents are irrevocable, absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected or discharged by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Section 10.04, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Section 10 or in respect of any security provided by or pursuant to the Security Documents (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Secured Party) including (and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to)

 (f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any Person under any Loan Document or any other document or security 
 (g) any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings 
 (h) any election of remedies by a Secured Party that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of such Guarantor or other rights of such Guarantor to proceed against any Obligor, any other guarantor or any other Person or entity or any collateral 
 (i) any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder or

 SECTION 10.05 Other Waivers . Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives 
 (a) promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of non-performance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice and this guarantee and any requirement that a Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any security, Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against an Obligor, any other guarantor or any other Person or entity or any collateral

 105

 SECTION 10.09 Deferral of Guarantors Rights . All rights which a Guarantor at any time has (whether in respect of this guarantee, a mortgage or any other transaction) against the Borrowers, any other Obligor or their respective assets shall be fully subordinated to the rights of the Secured Parties under the Loan Documents and until all obligations under the Loan Documents are paid in full and unless the Administrative Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise its rights which it may have (whether in respect of any Loan Document to which it is a Party or any other transaction) by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Loan Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Section 10 
 (a) to be indemnified by any Obligor 
 (b) to claim any contribution from any third party providing security for, or any other guarantor of, any Obligor s obligations under the Loan Documents

 (f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Secured Party.

 106 

SECTION 10.10 Additional Security . This guarantee and any other security or Lien given by each Guarantor is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by, and shall not prejudice, any other guarantee or security or any other right of recourse now or subsequently held by any Secured Party or any right of set-off or netting or right to combine accounts in connection with the Loan Documents. 
 SECTION 10.11 Independent Obligations . The obligations of each Guarantor under or in respect of this guarantee are independent of any other obligations of any other Obligor under or in respect of the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this guarantee irrespective of whether any action is brought against any other Obligor or whether any other Obligor is joined in any such action or actions. 
 SECTION 10.12 Limitation of Liability .

To effectuate the foregoing intention, each of the Guarantors and each of the Secured Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that the obligations guaranteed by each Guarantor under this guarantee shall be limited to such amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, result in the obligations of such Guarantor in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
