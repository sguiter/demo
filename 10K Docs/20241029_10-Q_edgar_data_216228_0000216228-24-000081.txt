NOTE 5 
 Effective tax rate 
 The decrease in the ETR for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to a benefit recognized on the sale of our Wolverine business. The increase in the ETR for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was due to prior year benefits of from the valuation allowance reversal on deferred tax assets in Germany and from filing an amended 2017 consolidated federal tax return. These benefits were partially offset by a prior year expense of relating to an Italian tax audit settlement covering tax years 2016-2022. 
 In October 2021, more than 135 countries and jurisdictions agreed to participate in a two-pillar international tax approach developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes establishing a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent. The OECD published Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two) in December 2021 and subsequently issued additional commentary and administrative guidance clarifying several aspects of the model rules. Since the model rules have been released, many countries have enacted Pillar Two-related laws, some of which became effective January 1, 2024, and it is anticipated that many more will follow suit throughout 2024 and 2025. As of September 28, 2024, the Company does not expect Pillar Two taxes to have a significant impact on its 2024 financial statements. 
 The Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to examination by tax authorities in these jurisdictions. The Company is currently under examination in several jurisdictions including China, Czechia, Germany, India, Italy, and the U.S. The estimated tax liability calculation for unrecognized tax benefits considers uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various tax jurisdictions. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit. Over the next 12 months, the net amount of the tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits in foreign and domestic jurisdictions could decrease by approximately due to changes in audit status, expiration of statutes of limitations and other events.

 Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10) 
 ASU 2021-10 requires entities to provide information about the nature of transactions, related policies and effect of government grants on an entity s financial statements. In particular, to qualify for an energy subsidy in Italy, a company must apply for and receive a certificate attesting that the company is an "energy and gas consuming company" (high energy consumption connected to the production cycle). The amount of subsidies granted is calculated based on a percentage of actual consumption, ranging from 25 to 40 . One of our Italian subsidiaries within our MT segment obtained this certificate and was granted energy subsidies from the Italian government beginning in April 2022. This program concluded in the second quarter of 2023. Accordingly, no energy subsidies were granted for the three or nine months ended September 28, 2024, or the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a benefit of related to energy subsidies, which we recorded within Costs of revenue in our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations. There was no other material government assistance received by the Company or any of our subsidiaries during the periods.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (In millions, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated) 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 ITT Inc. is a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered critical components and customized technology solutions for the transportation, industrial, and energy markets. We manufacture components that are integral to the operation of systems and manufacturing processes in these key markets. Our products enable functionality for applications where reliability and performance are critically important to our customers and the users of their products. 
 Our businesses share a common, repeatable operating model centered on our engineering capabilities. Each business applies its technology and engineering expertise to solve our customers most pressing challenges. Our applied engineering provides a valuable business relationship with our customers given the critical nature of their applications. This in turn provides us with unique insight to our customers requirements and enables us to develop solutions to assist our customers in achieving their business goals. Our technology and customer intimacy produce opportunities to capture recurring revenue streams, aftermarket opportunities and long-lived platforms from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 
 Our product and service offerings are organized into three reportable segments: Motion Technologies (MT), Industrial Process (IP), and Connect Control Technologies (CCT). See Note 3, Segment Information , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for a summary description of each segment. Additional information is also available in our 2023 Annual Report within Part I, Item 1, Description of Business. 
 All comparisons included within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to the comparable three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, unless stated otherwise. 
 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 During the third quarter of 2024, there has been continued uncertainty in the global economy, which has been, and will continue to be, influenced by a number of external factors, which are described below. 
 
 Middle East Conflict 
 Throughout 2024, the Israel-Hamas conflict has been ongoing. Our operations in Israel are limited to Habonim Industrial Valves and Actuators Ltd. (Habonim), which we acquired in April 2022 and is part of our IP segment. While there has been no material impact on our business to date, further escalation of this conflict, or an escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran or Yemen, could result in supply chain disruptions, inflation, workforce disruptions, demand fluctuations, or the inability to fulfill customer requests in the region. We are closely monitoring this situation, and are unable to reasonably estimate future impacts on our business and financial results at this time. 
 
 Inflationary Pressures 
 Inflationary pressures, driven by factors such as supply chain disruptions and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, have led to increased prices for energy and raw materials we use in our production processes, including commodities such as steel, oil, copper, and tin. Additionally, the manufacturing industry continues to experience a skilled labor shortage, which has created difficulties in attracting and retaining factory employees and has resulted in higher labor costs. We have been able to offset most of these negative impacts through pricing actions and productivity savings, which we continue to pursue. Future impacts on our business and financial results as a result of these conditions are not estimable at this time, and depend, in part, on the extent to which these conditions improve or worsen, which remains uncertain. For additional discussion of the risks related to global macroeconomic conditions, see Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report .

Refer to the section titled Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures for definitions and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics, including organic revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EPS. 
 Our third quarter 2024 results are summarized below: 
 Revenue of 885.2 increased by 63.1 due to higher sales volume, particularly within MT s Friction aftermarket and KONI rail businesses, IP s short-cycle business and CCT s connectors business. In addition, the acquisitions of kSARIA and Svaneh j contributed 55.2 to total revenue growth while the Wolverine and Matrix divestitures reduced total revenue by 33.9. The increase in revenue during the period was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.7. 
 Operating income of 207.9 increased by 64.8 primarily due to a 47.8 gain on sale of the Wolverine business in MT, as well as higher sales volume, pricing actions and productivity savings. The increase in operating income was partially offset by higher material and labor costs, temporary acquisition amortization and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. 
 Income from continuing operations was 1.96 per diluted share, an increase of 0.62 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher operating income, as discussed above. Adjusted income from continuing operations was 1.46 per diluted share, an increase of 0.09 as compared to the prior year.

 Motion Technologies 
 MT revenue for the three months ended September 28, 2024 decreased by 14.6 primarily due to a decline of 31.4 from the divestiture of Wolverine in July 2024. R evenue for the three-month period reflected strength in the Friction aftermarket and KONI rail businesses, which increased by 9 and 32 , respectively. MT revenue for the nine-month period increased 28.7, a s higher sales volume in our Friction business of 6 and KONI rail business of 23 was partially offset by the divestiture of Wolverine. The growth in the Friction business for the nine-month period is primarily attributable to strength in both OE and aftermarket. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted revenue by 1.5 during the third quarter and unfavorably impacted revenue by 8.4 during the nine-month period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestiture of Wolverine, organic revenue during the three- and nine-months periods increased by 15.3 and 68.5, respectively.

Industrial Process 
 IP revenue for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased by 54.0 and 158.5, respectively, primarily driven by the acquisition of Svaneh j, which closed in January 2024 and contributed 40.0 and 107.2, respectively, to total revenue growth. In addition, both periods benefited from higher sales volume and pricing actions. The three-month period benefited from growth in the short-cycle business of 8 , primarily in the energy and general industrial markets. The nine-month period saw growth in pump projects of 26 , primarily attributable to the energy market. T he increases in revenue during the three- and nine-month periods were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 3.1 and 6.9, respectively. Excluding the impacts from the acquisition and foreign currency translation, organic revenue for the three- and nine-month periods increased by 17.1 and 58.2, respectively. 
 Connect Control Technologies 
 CCT revenue for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased by 23.2 and 60.3, respectively. The acquisitions of kSARIA in September 2024 and Micro-Mode in May 2023 contributed 15.3 and 22.4 to the three- and nine-month periods, respectively, while the divestiture of the Matrix business in December 2023 partially offset the periods by 2.5 and 8.4, respectively. Connector sales grew 6 and 10 in the three- and nine-month periods, respect ively. The nine-month period also incl uded growth in component sales of 7 , particularly within the aerospace and defense markets. Both periods benefited from pricing actions. Excluding the impacts from the acquisitions, the divestiture of Matrix, a nd foreign currency translation, organic revenue for the three- and nine-month periods increased by 10.4 and 47.6, respectively. 
 
 GROSS PROFIT 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 314.0 and 279.4, respectively, reflecting gross margins of 35.5 and 34.0 , respectively. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 930.9 and 821.3, respectively, reflecting gross margins of 34.5 and 33.5 , respectively. The increases in gross profit and margin for both periods were primarily driven by increases in revenue, as described above, and productivity savings, partially offset by increases in material and labor costs.

General and administrative (G A) expenses increased 7.9 and 12.3 for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by the current year acquisitions of kSARIA and Svaneh j, partially offset by the divestiture of the Wolverine business. The increase in the three-month period was also attributable to unfavorable foreign currency impacts. In the nine-month period, higher restructuring costs, bad debt expense and unfavorable foreign currency impacts offset a prior year gain of 3.7 related to the recovery of lease termination costs. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased 6.1 and 20.0 for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher personnel costs and the additions of kSARIA and Svaneh j, partially offset by the divestiture of the Wolverine business. 
 Research and development expenses increased 3.6 and 11.2 for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by acquisitions, higher personnel costs and continued strategic investments to support innovation and new product development, partially offset by the divestiture of the Wolverine business.

 MT operating income for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 50.6 and 81.3, respectively, primarily due to a 47.8 gain on sale of the Wolverine business. In addition, the three- and nine-month periods benefited from productivity savings and lower raw material and overhead costs, partially offset by lower revenue due to the Wolverine divestiture, unfavorable foreign currency impacts and higher labor costs. 
 IP operating income for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 5.1 and 13.0, respectively. The increase in the three-month period was primarily driven by productivity savings, sales volume and pricing, partially offset by higher material, labor and overhead costs and increased bad debt expense due to a prior year recovery. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily driven by higher revenue, as discussed above, and productivity savings. This increase was partially offset by higher material, labor, overhead, M A costs and unfavorable sales mix. 
 CCT operating income for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 4.9 and 15.2 primarily driven by higher revenue, as discussed above, and productivity savings, partially offset by higher material, labor, and overhead costs. The increase during the nine-month period was also partially offset by a prior year gain of 7.2 from the sale of a product line. 
 ITT Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 28 

Other corporate costs for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 decreased 4.2 and increased 2.8, respectively. The decrease in the three-month period was primarily due to lower personnel-related costs and higher earnings on corporate-owned life insurance. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily driven by a one-time benefit of 3.7 in the prior year period related to the recovery of lease termination costs. 
 
 INTEREST AND NON-OPERATING EXPENSES, NET 
 The following table summarizes our interest and non-operating income and expenses. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Interest expense 10.0 4.2 138.1 25.1 15.4 63.0 Interest income (1.6) (1.9) (15.8) (5.0) (6.5) (23.1) Other non-operating income, net (0.2) (0.9) (77.8) (1.9) (1.5) 26.7 Total interest and non-operating expenses, net 
 8.2 1.4 485.7 18.2 7.4 145.9 
 The increase in total interest and non-operating expenses, net for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense due to higher average outstanding long-term debt in connection with our acquisitions of Svaneh j and kSARIA. 
 
 INCOME TAX EXPENSE 
 The following table summarizes our income tax expense and effective tax rate (ETR). 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Income tax expense 37.8 29.9 26.4 103.6 80.6 28.5 Effective tax rate 18.9 21.1 (220) bps 20.8 20.0 80 bps 
 The decrease in the ETR for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to a benefit recognized on the sale of Wolverine. The increase in the ETR for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was due to prior year benefits of 16.3 from valuation allowance reversals on deferred tax assets in Germany and 4.9 from filing an amended 2017 consolidated federal tax return. These benefits were partially offset by a prior year expense of 14.3 relating to an Italian tax audit settlement covering tax years 2016-2022. 
 In October 2021, more than 135 countries and jurisdictions agreed to participate in a two-pillar international tax approach developed by the OECD, which includes establishing a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent. The OECD published Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two) in December 2021 and subsequently issued additional commentary and administrative guidance clarifying several aspects of the model rules. Since the model rules have been released, many countries have enacted Pillar Two-related laws, some of which became effective on January 1, 2024, and it is anticipated that many more will follow suit throughout 2024 and 2025. As of September 28, 2024, the Company does not expect Pillar Two taxes to have a significant impact on its 2024 financial statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Funding and Liquidity Strategy 
 We monitor our funding needs and execute strategies to meet overall liquidity requirements, including the management of our capital structure, on both a short- and long-term basis. Significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include our cash flow from operations, credit ratings, the availability of commercial paper, access to bank lines of credit, term loans, and the ability to attract long-term capital on satisfactory terms. We assess these factors along with current market conditions on a continuous basis, and as a result, may alter the mix of our short- and long-term financing when it is advantageous to do so. We expect to have enough liquidity to fund operations for at least the next 12 months and beyond. 
 We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. We support our growth and expansion in markets outside of the U.S. through the enhancement of existing products and development of new products, increased capital spending, and potential foreign acquisitions. We look for opportunities to access cash balances in excess of local operating requirements to meet our global liquidity needs in a cost-efficient manner. We transfer cash between certain international subsidiaries and the U.S. when it is cost effective to do so. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we had net cash distributions from foreign countries to the U.S. of 99.3. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we had net cash distributions from foreign countries to the U.S. of 357.5. The timing and amount of any additional future distributions will be evaluated based on our jurisdictional cash needs. 
 The amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock are within the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on, and affected by, several factors, including our financial position and results of operations, available cash, expected capital spending plans, prevailing business conditions, and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance as to what level of dividends, if any, will be paid in the future. In the third quarter of 2024, we declared a dividend of 0.319 per share for shareholders of record on September 3, 2024, which was a 10 increase from the quarterly dividends of 0.29 that were declared in 2023. Dividend payments during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 amounted to 78.7. 
 From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its stock on the open market. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including remaining authorization under existing Board-approved share repurchase programs, the Company s stock price, restrictions under the Company s debt obligations, other uses for capital, the dilutive impact of shares issued during the period related to the Company s long-term incentive plans, impacts on the value of remaining shares, and market and economic conditions. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we spent 25.0 and 104.0 on open-market share repurchases under our share repurchase programs, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we spent 0.0 and 60.0 on open-market share repurchases under our share repurchase programs, respectively. All repurchased shares are retired immediately following the repurchases. See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds , for additional information. 
 
 Commercial Paper 
 When available and economically feasible, we have accessed the commercial paper market through programs in place in the U.S. to supplement cash flows generated internally and to provide additional short-term funding. 
 The following table presents our outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
 September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial Paper Outstanding - U.S. Program 359.6 184.9 
 In the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we increased our borrowings under the U.S. commercial paper program to partially finance the acquisition of Svaneh j. See Note 13, Debt , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. 
 ITT Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 30 

All outstanding commercial paper for both periods had maturity terms of less than three months from the date of issuance. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 On August 5, 2021, we entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of third party lenders including Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement). The 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement matures in August 2026 and provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to 700 of (i) revolving extensions of credit (the revolving loans) outstanding at any time, and (ii) letters of credit for a face amount of up to 100 at any time outstanding. Subject to certain conditions, we are permitted to terminate permanently the total commitments and reduce commitments by a minimum aggregate amount of 10 or any whole multiple of 1 in excess thereof. Borrowings under the credit facility are available in U.S. dollars, Euros, British pound sterling or any other currency that may be requested by us, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and each lender. We are permitted to request that lenders increase the commitments under the facility by up to 350 for a maximum aggregate principal amount of 1,050; however, this is subject to certain conditions and therefore may not be available to us. As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 13, Debt , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. 
 U.S. Term Loan 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the kSARIA Credit Agreement) among the Company, as borrower, each lender from time to time party thereto, and U.S. Bank National Association, as the administrative agent, sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner. 
 The kSARIA Credit Agreement has a maturity of three years and provides for a term loan of 464, which had been borrowed and was used to finance the Company s acquisition of kSARIA on September 12, 2024. Total outstanding borrowings under the kSARIA Credit Agreement were 464.0 as of September 28, 2024. See Note 13, Debt , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. 
 Italian Term Loan 
 On January 12, 2024, ITT Italia S.r.l. (ITT Italia), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a facility agreement (the ITT Italia Credit Agreement), among the Company, as a guarantor, ITT Italia, as borrower, and BNP Paribas, Italian Branch, as bookrunner, sole underwriter and global coordinator, mandated lead arranger and agent. 
 The ITT Italia Credit Agreement had an initial maturity of three years and provided for term loan borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of 300 (or 328.9), 275 (or 301.5) of which were used to finance the Company s acquisition of Svaneh j, which closed on January 19, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, ITT Italia repaid 175, representing the remaining outstanding balance on the ITT Italia Credit Agreement. Year-to-date repayments of the facility agreement totaled 275. See Note 13, Debt , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.

Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 Our principal source of liquidity is our cash flow generated from operating activities, which provides us with the ability to meet the majority of our short-term funding requirements. The following table summarizes net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as well as net cash from discontinued operations. 
 For the Nine Months Ended 
 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Operating activities 339.4 367.6 Investing activities (794.6) (142.0) Financing activities 432.0 (345.2) Foreign exchange (4.4) (10.4) Total net cash from continuing operations (27.6) (130.0) Net cash from discontinued operations (0.4) (0.2) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (28.0) (130.2) 
 Operating Activities 
 The decrease in net cash from operating activities of 28.2 was primarily due to unfavorable working capital from timing of accounts receivable collections and higher compensation payments in the current year, partially offset by an increase in segment operating income. 
 Investing Activities 
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities of 652.6 was mainly driven by the acquisitions of kSARIA and S vaneh j, offset by proceeds from the divestiture of the Wolverine business. Refer to Note 18, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. 
 Financing Activities 
 The increase in net cash from financing activities of 777.2 was mainly driven by an increase in commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to finance the current year acquisitions. The term loan borrowing to partially fund the S vaneh j acquisition was fully repaid during the third quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 13, Debt , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. The increase was also driven by additional open-market share repurchase activity and dividend payments. Refer to Note 15, Capital Stock , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 Management reviews a variety of key performance indicators including revenue, operating income and margin, and earnings per share. In addition, we consider certain measures to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented. These measures provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations and management of assets from period to period. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. Some of these metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators for purposes of our reconciliation tables. 
 Organic Revenue is defined as revenue, excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, and divestitures that may or may not qualify as discontinued operations. Current year activity from acquisitions is excluded for twelve months following the closing date of acquisition. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency fluctuations is estimated using a fixed exchange rate for both the current and prior periods. Prior year revenue is adjusted to exclude activity during the comparable period for twelve months post-closing date for divestitures that do not qualify as discontinued operations. We believe that reporting organic revenue provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. 
 Reconciliations of revenue to organic revenue for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 are provided below.

 Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income adjusted to exclude special items that include, but are not limited to, restructuring, certain asset impairment charges, certain acquisition- and divestiture-related impacts, and unusual or infrequent operating items. Special items represent charges or credits that impact current results, which management views as unrelated to the Company s ongoing operations and performance. Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as adjusted operating income divided by revenue. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in

Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations is defined as income from continuing operations attributable to ITT Inc. adjusted to exclude special items that include, but are not limited to, restructuring, certain asset impairment charges, certain acquisition- and divestiture-related impacts, income tax settlements or adjustments, and unusual or infrequent items. Special items represent charges or credits, on an after-tax basis, that impact current results, which management views as unrelated to the Company s ongoing operations and performance. The after-tax basis of each special item is determined using the jurisdictional tax rate of where the expense or benefit occurred. Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share (Adjusted EPS) is defined as adjusted income from continuing operations divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. We believe that adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating ongoing operating profitability, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. 
 Reconciliations of adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to ITT to income from continuing operations attributable to ITT and adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to ITT per diluted share to income from continuing operations attributable to ITT per diluted share (EPS) for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are provided below.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 See Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements , to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of the Company s financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Annual Report describes the critical accounting estimates that are used in the preparation of the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates. There have been no material changes concerning the Company s critical accounting estimates as described in our 2023 Annual Report .

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction Syria Human Rights Act (ITRA) 
 This disclosure is made pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 which added subsection (r) to Section 13 of the Exchange Act (Section 13(r)). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or any of its affiliates have knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran. Disclosure of such activities, transactions or dealings is required even when conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. persons in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not such activities are sanctionable under U.S. law. 
 In its 2012 Annual Report , ITT described its acquisition of all the shares of Joh. Heinr. Bornemann GmbH (Bornemann) in November 2012, as well as certain activities of Bornemann in Iran and the wind down of those activities in accordance with a General License issued on December 26, 2012 by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the General License). As permitted by the General License, on or before March 8, 2013, Bornemann completed the wind-down activities and ceased all activities in Iran. As required to be disclosed by Section 13(r), the gross revenues and operating income to Bornemann from its Iranian activities subsequent to its acquisition by ITT were 2.2 million Euros and 1.5 million Euros, respectively. Prior to its acquisition by ITT, Bornemann issued a performance bond to its Iranian customer in the amount of 1.3 million Euros (the Bond). Bornemann requested that the Bond be canceled prior to March 8, 2013; however, the former customer refused this request and as a result the Bond remains outstanding. Bornemann did not receive gross revenues or operating income, or pay interest, with respect to the Bond in any subsequent periods through September 28, 2024, however, Bornemann did pay fees of approximately 5 thousand Euros during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and annual fees of 7 thousand Euros during 2023 to the German financial institution which is maintaining the Bond.
