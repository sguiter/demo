 The Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments that are categorized as Level 3: 
 Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated to determine whether the enterprise value of the portfolio company is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Investment Adviser carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value the Company s portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio company. 
 Investments in debt securities that do not have sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are valued based on an expected probability of default and discount recovery analysis.

 term. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon at least days written notice to the other party. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these services, the Adviser receives fees from the Company consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee. 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters; provided, however, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s gross assets as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters that exceeds the product of (A) and (B) the average value of the Company s net asset value at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Gross assets is determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, includes assets acquired through the incurrence of debt (see Note 8, Borrowings, to these unaudited consolidated financial statements), and excludes cash and any temporary investments in cash equivalents. For purposes of this calculation, cash and cash equivalents includes U.S. government securities and other high quality investment grade debt investments that mature in 12 months or less from the date of investment. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, will be appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during such the applicable fiscal quarters, and will be appropriately pro-rated for any partial month or quarter. 
 The incentive fee has two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The second part is determined and payable in arrears based on capital gains as of the end of each calendar year. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, has been compared to a hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) or a catch-up rate of per quarter annualized), as applicable. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays its Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to its pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 no incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in any calendar quarter in which its pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of ; 
 of pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with approximately of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized) will be payable to the Investment Adviser. This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all pre-incentive fee net investment income thereafter is allocated to the Investment Adviser. 
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the date of determination, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, provided that, the incentive fee determined at the end of the first calendar year of operations may be calculated for a period

 Incentive fees Total base management fees and incentive fees 
 Accrued capital gains incentive fees are based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from inception. Accordingly, the accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were accrued or realized capital gains incentive fees.

 Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act and have operated our business as a BDC since we began our investment activities. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a registered investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Code ). We were formed in February 2012, commenced investment operations in May 2013 and began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, under the symbol CGBD, upon completion of our initial public offering in June 2017. Our principal executive offices are located at One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, New York 10017. 
 85 

Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through assembling a portfolio of secured debt investments in U.S. middle market companies. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with approximately 25 million to 100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), supported by financial sponsors. This core strategy is opportunistically supplemented with differentiated and complementary lending and investing strategies, which take advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and unitranche loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, Middle Market Senior Loans ), with a minority of our assets invested in higher yielding investments (which may include unsecured debt, subordinated debt and investments in equities and structured products). The Middle Market Senior Loans are generally made to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in many cases, controlled by private equity firms. 
 We invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, or would likely be rated below investment grade if it was rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 We are externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act and a subsidiary of Carlyle. We benefit from our Investment Adviser s investment team of over 200 investment professionals with the deep knowledge and expertise across multiple asset classes who are supported by a team of finance, operations and administrative professionals currently employed by Carlyle Employee Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlyle. In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale, relationships and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. 
 Third Quarter 2024 Highlights 
 Quarterly Results 
 Net investment income, inclusive of the preferred dividend, was 24.0 million or 0.47 per common share. 
 Adjusted for one-time expenses related to the reset of the 2015-1R Notes, the adjusted net investment income per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) was 0.49. Refer to the Adjusted Net Investment Income and Adjusted Net Income discussion within this section for further details. 
 Dividends declared on common shares for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 23.9 million, or 0.47 per share. 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, after adjusting for the acceleration of debt issuance costs related to the reset of the 2015-R Notes, declined slightly from the comparable period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in portfolio size, partially offset by lower non-accruals. 
 The NAV per common share decreased to 16.85 as of September 30, 2024, from 16.95 as of June 30, 2024. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 175 investments across 128 portfolio companies and 26 industries for a total fair value of 1.7 billion. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had investment fundings of 143.4 million and investment repayments of 171.2 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, non-accrual investments represented 1.2 and 0.6 of our portfolio based on cost and fair value, respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Activity 
 On August 2, 2024, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Carlyle Secured Lending III. In connection with the Merger Agreement, all shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding will be exchanged for shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction at a rate equal to the quotient of (i) the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock and (ii) the Closing CGBD Net Asset Value per share. Refer to Note 14, Merger with CSL III, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Merger Agreement, the Mergers and the Preferred Stock Exchange.

On July 17, 2024, we issued 53,517 shares for a total consideration of 1.0 million under the dividend reinvestment plan. 
 Total liquidity as of September 30, 2024 was 354.8 million in cash and undrawn debt capacity. 
 Recent Developments 
 On October 18, 2024, we completed a public offering of 300.0 million aggregate principal of 6.75 senior unsecured notes due February 18, 2030 (the 2030 Notes ). In connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. for a total notional amounts of 300.0 million. Under the interest rate agreement, commencing on the effective date of August 18, 2025, we will receive a fixed interest rate of 6.75 and pays a floating interest rate based on the compounded average daily SOFR plus 3.23 . 
 On November 4, 2024, we declared common stock dividends of 0.45 per share to be paid on January 17, 2025. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 As a BDC, we believe that the key components of our results of operations for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, net investment income and net asset value per common share. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded basic earnings per common share of 0.37, declared a dividend of 0.47 per common share and earned 0.47 of net investment income per common share. 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data): 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Basic Diluted Basic Diluted Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations attributable to Common Stockholders 18,736 19,611 17,871 18,746 Weighted-average common shares outstanding 50,838,569 56,446,589 50,794,941 56,365,822 Earnings per share 0.37 0.35 0.35 0.33 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we declared dividends per common share of 0.47 and 0.47, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our NAV per share was 16.85 and 16.99, respectively. 
 Investment Income 
 We generate investment income primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. At times, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate investment income in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include: (i) investment advisory fees, including base management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; (iii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement; and (iv) other operating expenses summarized below:

 Portfolio Credit 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk assessment policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as Internal Risk Ratings . Key drivers of internal risk ratings include financial metrics, financial covenants, liquidity and enterprise value coverage. Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 5, which are defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. 
 92 

Rating Definition 1 Borrower is operating above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 
 2 Borrower is operating generally as expected or at an acceptable level of performance. The level of risk to our initial cost basis is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. This is the initial risk rating assigned to all new borrowers. 3 Borrower is operating below expectations and level of risk to our cost basis has increased since the time of 
 origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants. Payments are generally current although there may be higher risk of payment default. 
 4 Borrower is operating materially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. It is anticipated that we may not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 5 Borrower is operating substantially below expectations and the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
 Our Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the risk ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings in connection with our quarterly valuation process. The below table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 The following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the three month periods ending September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively: 
 Three months ended Change September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Investment income: Interest income 41,617 42,949 (1,332) PIK income 5,033 5,761 (728) Dividend income 8,276 8,781 (505) Other income 1,039 773 266 Total investment income 55,965 58,264 (2,299) Expenses: Base management fees 6,590 6,677 (87) Incentive fees 5,101 5,524 (423) Professional fees 727 728 (1) Administrative service fees 337 312 25 Interest expense and credit facility fees 16,882 16,616 266 Directors fees and expenses 147 159 (12) Other general and administrative 547 398 149 Excise tax expense 750 977 (227) Total expenses 31,081 31,391 (310) Net investment income (loss) 24,884 26,873 (1,989) Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation): Net realized gain (loss) on investments (11,477) 4,198 (15,675) Net realized currency gain (loss) on non-investment assets and liabilities (593) 43 (636) Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments 9,085 (12,487) 21,572 Net change in unrealized currency gains (losses) on non-investment assets and liabilities (2,288) 119 (2,407) Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and non-investment assets and liabilities (5,273) (8,127) 2,854 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 19,611 18,746 865 
 Investment Income 
 The decrease in investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in average outstanding investment balance due to sales and repayments of our investments and a lower weighted average yield on the portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the size of our portfolio decreased to 1,757,621 from 1,783,219 as of June 30, 2024, at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the weighted average yield of our total debt and income producing investments was 11.9 and 12.7 , respectively, based on amortized cost. 
 Interest income and PIK income on our first and second lien debt investments are dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, two and three of our debt investments were on non-accrual status, respectively. Non-accrual investments had a fair value of 10,472 and 30,209, which represented approximately 0.6 and 1.8 of total investments at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 99 

The increase in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in prepayment fees. 
 Expenses 
 The increase in interest expense and credit facility fees was primarily driven by the acceleration of debt issuance costs as a result of the refinancing of the 2015-1R Notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The decrease in base management fees was driven by lower average gross assets as a result of net repayments on our investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 The decrease in incentive fees was driven by lower pre-incentive fee net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no accrued capital gains incentive fees based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of September 30, 2024. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. See Note 4, Related Party Transactions, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the incentive and base management fees. 
 Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 The amount of and number of investments with realized gain (loss) and change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Realized gains on investments 2,144 5,118 Number of investments with realized gains 2 4 Realized losses on investments (13,621) (920) Number of investments with realized losses 3 2 Change in unrealized appreciation on investments 24,398 12,092 Number of investments with unrealized appreciation 80 67 Change in unrealized depreciation on investments (15,313) (24,579) Number of investments with unrealized depreciation 93 97 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a realized loss after the sale of our investments in Emergency Communications Network, LLC and Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited partially offset by a realized gain from the sale of our equity investment in Chartis Holding, LLC. 
 The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is driven by changes in various inputs used in our valuation methodology, including but not limited to enterprise value multiples, borrower leverage ratios, borrower ratings, and the impact of exits. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is also driven by the reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation related to Emergency Communications Network, LLC.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 The following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 Three months ended September 30, Change Nine months ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Investment income: Interest income 41,617 46,040 (4,423) 131,008 137,142 (6,134) PIK income 5,033 5,417 (384) 16,301 14,321 1,980 Dividend income 8,276 8,276 25,333 24,828 505 Other income 1,039 768 271 3,594 2,650 944 Total investment income 55,965 60,501 (4,536) 176,236 178,941 (2,705) Expenses: Base management fees 6,590 7,080 (490) 20,155 21,501 (1,346) Incentive fees 5,101 5,530 (429) 16,492 16,595 (103) Professional fees 727 684 43 2,200 1,896 304 Administrative service fees 337 369 (32) 1,150 866 284 Interest expense and credit facility fees 16,882 18,222 (1,340) 51,361 53,376 (2,015) Directors fees and expenses 147 103 44 457 333 124 Other general and administrative 547 552 (5) 1,658 1,495 163 Excise tax expense 750 850 (100) 2,557 2,023 534 Total expenses 31,081 33,390 (2,309) 96,030 98,085 (2,055) Net investment income (loss) 24,884 27,111 (2,227) 80,206 80,856 (650) Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation): Net realized gain (loss) on investments (11,477) (142) (11,335) (26,465) (21,448) (5,017) Net realized currency gain (loss) on non-investment assets and liabilities (593) 406 (999) 90 398 (308) Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments 9,085 315 8,770 14,930 3,689 11,241 Net change in unrealized currency gains (losses) on non-investment assets and liabilities (2,288) 2,297 (4,585) (1,140) (808) (332) Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and non-investment assets and liabilities (5,273) 2,876 (8,149) (12,585) (18,169) 5,584 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 19,611 29,987 (10,376) 67,621 62,687 4,934 
 Investment Income 
 The decrease in investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income. As of September 30, 2024, the size of our portfolio decreased to 1,757,621 from 1,926,884 as of September 30, 2023, at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the weighted average yield of our total debt and income producing investments was 11.9 and 12.3 , respectively, based on amortized cost. 
 Interest income and PIK income on our first and second lien debt investments are dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, two and four of our debt investments were on non-accrual status, respectively. Non-accrual investments had a fair value of 10,472 and 36,600, which represented approximately 0.6 and 2.0 of total investments at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 101 

The increase in other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by higher amendment and prepayment fees. 
 Expenses 
 The decrease in interest expense and credit facility fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a lower average principal balance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The change in incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is driven by changes in pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 The decrease in base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by lower average gross assets as a result of net repayments on our investments. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no accrued capital gains incentive fees based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of September 30, 2024. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. See Note 4, Related Party Transactions, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the incentive and base management fees. 
 Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 The amount of and number of investments with realized gain (loss) and changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Realized gains on investments 2,144 153 22,314 1,600 Number of investments with realized gains 2 3 17 12 Realized losses on investments (13,621) (295) (48,779) (23,048) Number of investments with realized losses 3 2 8 14 Change in unrealized appreciation on investments 24,398 18,458 62,024 65,642 Number of investments with unrealized appreciation 80 112 105 123 Change in unrealized depreciation on investments (15,313) (18,143) (47,094) (61,953) Number of investments with unrealized depreciation 93 60 93 65 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a realized loss due to the write-off of our investment in American Physician Partners and Emergency Communications Network, LLC partially offset by realized gains from the recapitalization of our investment in Dermatology Associates and from our exit of the equity investment in Legacy.com, Inc. 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is driven by changes in other inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, enterprise value multiples, borrower leverage multiples and borrower ratings, and the impact of exits. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly driven by the reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation (depreciation) related to American Physician Partners.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capitalization 
 We have capitalized our business to date primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock, asset-level financing, and the issuance of unsecured senior debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 852,593 of outstanding consolidated indebtedness under the Credit Facility, the 2015-1R Notes and the Senior Notes as previously discussed within Portfolio and Investment Activity - Portfolio Financing . As of September 30, 2024, we had 354,808 of liquidity that can be used to satisfy our short-term cash requirements and working capital for our business. Refer to Note 8, Borrowings, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our financing. 
 Our Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference equal to 25 per share (the Liquidation Preference plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends up to but excluding the date of distribution. Dividends on our Preferred Stock are payable on a quarterly basis in an initial amount equal to 7.00 per annum of the Liquidation Preference per share, payable in cash, or at our option, 9.00 per annum of the Liquidation Preference payable in additional shares of Preferred Stock. 
 The Preferred Stock is convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder of the Preferred Stock into the number of shares of common stock equal to the Liquidation Preference plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends, divided by an initial conversion price of 9.50, subject to certain adjustments to prevent dilution as set forth in the Company's articles supplementary (the Articles Supplementary ). The conversion price as of September 30, 2024 was 8.92. Effective as of May 5, 2023, the Company, with the approval of the Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, has the option to redeem all of the Preferred Stock for cash consideration equal to the Liquidation Preference plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock have the right to convert all or a portion of their shares of Preferred Stock prior to the date fixed for such redemption. Effective as of May 5, 2027, the holders of the Preferred Stock have the option to require the Company to redeem any or all of the then-outstanding Preferred Stock upon 90 days notice. The form of consideration used in any such redemption is at the option of the Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, and may be cash consideration equal to the Liquidation Preference plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends, or shares of common stock. Holders also have the right to redeem the Preferred Stock upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Articles Supplementary). Refer to Note 14, Merger with CSL III, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Merger Agreement, the Mergers and the Preferred Stock Exchange. 
 The following table presents our certain capitalization ratios: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Net Financial Leverage (1) 
 0.89x 1.02x Statutory Debt to Equity (2) 
 1.05x 1.19x 
 (1) Reflects cumulative convertible preferred securities as equity, net of excess cash held at period end, which was 38.5 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Reflects cumulative convertible preferred securities as debt. These securities are considered "senior securities" for the purposes of calculating asset coverage pursuant to the Investment Company Act. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 68,669 60,447 Available borrowings under Credit Facility 
 286,139 359,675 Total Liquidity 354,808 420,122 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our common stock and through cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments as well as income earned on investments and cash equivalents. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Credit Facility, the issuance of debt, and through securitization of a portion of our existing investments. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders, repurchases of our common stock and for other general corporate purposes. We believe our current cash position, available capacity on our Credit Facility, which is well in excess of our unfunded commitments, and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us 
 103 

with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs which may arise at our portfolio companies. 
 Liquidity Needs 
 Our primary liquidity needs include our funding of new and existing portfolio investments, payment of operating expenses and interest and principal payments under the Credit Facility. From time to time, we may also repurchase our outstanding debt or shares of our common stock. 
 Contractual Obligations and Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could occur which may give rise to liabilities arising from these provisions against us. We believe that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of September 30, 2024 and the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 for any such exposure. 
 We have in the past, currently are and may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as revolving credit facilities, bridge financing commitments, or delayed draw commitments. We had the following unfunded commitments to fund delayed draw and revolving senior secured loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 Par / Principal Amount as of 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Unfunded delayed draw commitments 
 133,120 68,017 Unfunded revolving commitments 
 61,986 66,392 Total unfunded commitments 
 195,106 134,409 
 Pursuant to an undertaking by us in connection with the 2015-1 Debt Securitization, we agreed to hold on an ongoing basis the 2015-1 Issuer Preferred Interests with an aggregate dollar purchase price at least equal to 5 of the aggregate outstanding amount of all collateral obligations by the 2015-1 Issuer for so long as any securities of the 2015-1 Issuer remains outstanding. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with this undertaking. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table details the net change in our cash and cash equivalents: 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities 215,394 Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (207,172) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 8,222 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 264,425 related to cost of investments purchased and received 422,269 in repayments on our investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments of 63,881 on the Credit Facility and repaid 449,200 of principal on the 2015-1R Notes. 
 
 Asset Coverage 
 In accordance with the Investment Company Act, a BDC is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, satisfies the minimum asset coverage ratio specified in the Investment Company Act after such borrowing. Asset coverage generally refers to a company s total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, as defined in the Investment Company Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. Senior securities for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock. 
 Prior to March 23, 2018, BDCs were required to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio of 200 . On March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the Investment Company Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum asset coverage ratio from 200 to 150 , so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. Under 
 104 

the 200 minimum asset coverage ratio, BDCs are permitted to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity, and under the 150 minimum asset coverage ratio, BDCs are permitted to borrow up to two dollars for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. In other words, Section 61(a) of the Investment Company Act, as amended, permits BDCs to potentially increase their debt-to-equity ratio from a maximum of 1 to 1 to a maximum of 2 to 1. 
 On April 9, 2018 and June 6, 2018, the Board of Directors, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act), and the stockholders of the Company, respectively, approved the application to the Company of the 150 minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, as amended. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was reduced from 200 to 150 , effective as of June 7, 2018. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had total senior securities of 902,593 and 1,034,556, respectively, consisting of secured borrowings under the Credit Facility, the Senior Notes, the Securitizations, and the Preferred Stock, and had asset coverage ratios of 194.9 and 183.4 , respectively. For the purposes of the asset coverage ratio, the Preferred Stock is classified as a senior security. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. There have been no material changes in the critical accounting estimates since those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates. 
 Valuation Risk 
 Our investments generally do not have a readily available market price. Our Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, values our investments for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith at fair value in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. In addition, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, on a fair value basis, approximately 99.6 of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors. The Credit Facility and the 2015-1N Debt are also subject to floating interest rates and are primarily paid based on floating SOFR rates. The 2028 Notes, which bear a fixed rate, are hedged by entering into fixed to floating interest rate swaps, in order to align the interest rates of our liabilities in our investment portfolio. The 2024 Notes bear a fixed rate. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our income in the future. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income, should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. These hypothetical interest income calculations are based on a model of the settled debt investments in our portfolio, excluding structured finance obligations and our investments in Credit Fund and Credit Fund II, held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates and the impact of that change on interest income. Interest expense is calculated based on 
 105 

outstanding secured borrowings and notes payable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and based on the terms of our Credit Facility and notes payable. Interest expense on our Credit Facility and notes payable is calculated using the stated interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. We intend to continue to finance a portion of our investments with borrowings and the interest rates paid on our borrowings may significantly impact our net interest income. 
 We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates for our settled debt investments (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments), excluding our investments in Credit Fund and Credit Fund II, and outstanding secured borrowings and notes payable assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Basis Point Change Interest Income Interest Expense Net Investment Income Interest Income Interest Expense Net Investment Income Up 300 basis points 40,927 (19,730) 21,197 44,769 (23,087) 21,682 Up 200 basis points 27,285 (13,153) 14,132 29,846 (15,391) 14,455 Up 100 basis points 13,642 (6,577) 7,065 14,923 (7,696) 7,227 Down 100 basis points (13,642) 6,577 (7,065) (14,923) 7,696 (7,227) Down 200 basis points (27,285) 13,153 (14,132) (29,846) 15,391 (14,455) Down 300 basis points (40,858) 19,730 (21,128) (44,740) 23,087 (21,653) 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 106 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company may become party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company. See also Note 12, Litigation, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth within this Form 10-Q, consideration should be given to the information disclosed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Risks Relating to the Mergers 
 Sales of shares of our common stock after the completion of the Mergers may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline . 
 At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), each share of common share of beneficial interest, 0.001 par value per share, of CSL III CSL III Common Shares ), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by CGBD or any of its consolidated subsidiaries (the Cancelled Shares )), will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of our common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in Note 14, Merger with CSL III, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), plus any cash (without interest) in lieu of fractional shares. Our stockholders may decide not to hold their shares of our common stock after completion of the Mergers. Such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the trading price for our common stock and may take place promptly following the completion of the Mergers. If this occurs, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities should we desire to do so. 
 Most of our stockholders will experience a reduction in percentage ownership and voting power in the combined company as a result of the Mergers. 
 Our stockholders will experience a reduction in their percentage ownership interests and effective voting power in respect of the combined company relative to their percentage ownership interests in us prior to the Mergers unless they hold a comparable or greater percentage ownership in CSL III as they do in us prior to the Mergers. Consequently, our stockholders should generally expect to exercise less influence over the management and policies of the combined company following the Mergers than they currently exercise over our management and policies. In addition, prior to completion of the Mergers, subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement, we and CSL III may issue additional shares of our common stock and CSL III Common Shares, respectively, which would further reduce the percentage ownership of the combined company to be held by our current stockholders. 
 We may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated by the Mergers, including estimated cost savings, or it may take longer than anticipated to achieve such benefits. 
 The realization of certain benefits anticipated as a result of the Mergers will depend in part on the integration of CSL III s investment portfolio with our investment portfolio and the integration of CSL III s business with our business. There can be no assurance that CSL III s investment portfolio or business can be operated profitably going forward or integrated successfully into our operations in a timely fashion or at all. The dedication of management resources to such integration may detract attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company and there can be no assurance that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or there will not be other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts. Such effects, including incurring unexpected costs or delays in connection with such integration and failure of CSL III s investment portfolio to perform as expected, could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the combined company. 
 We also expect to achieve certain synergies and cost savings from the Mergers when the two companies have fully integrated their portfolios. It is possible that the estimates of these synergies and potential cost savings could ultimately be incorrect. The cost savings estimates also assume we will be able to combine our operations and CSL III s operations in a manner that permits those cost savings to be fully realized. If the estimates turn out to be incorrect or if we are not able to successfully combine the CSL III investment portfolio or business with our operations, the anticipated synergies and cost savings may not be fully realized or realized at all or may take longer to realize than expected. 
 107 

If the Mergers do not close, we will not benefit from the expenses incurred in pursuit of the Mergers. 
 If the Mergers do not close, we will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. We have incurred out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Mergers for investment banking, legal and accounting fees and financial printing and other related charges, much of which will be incurred even if the Mergers are not completed. 
 The termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us. 
 If the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences, including: 
 our business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Mergers, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Mergers; 
 the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the market price prior to termination reflects a market assumption that the Mergers will be completed; 
 our business may have experienced negative reactions from the investment community, employees, or other partners in the business community; and 
 we may have been required to pay certain costs relating to the Mergers, whether or not the Mergers are completed. 
 The Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Mergers. 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to discuss, facilitate or commit to competing third party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of us (a Takeover Proposal ), which are typical for transactions of this type. In certain circumstances relating to a Takeover Proposal, a termination fee of 26 million would be payable by the Company to CSL III, as is customary for transactions of this type. The termination fee might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing that acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share market price than that proposed in the Mergers or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. 
 The Mergers are subject to closing conditions, including stockholder approvals, that, if not satisfied or (to the extent legally allowed) waived, will result in the Mergers not being completed, which may result in material adverse consequences to our business and operations. 
 The completion of the Mergers remains subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including among others (1) requisite approval of our stockholders, (2) authorization of the shares of our common stock to be issued as consideration in the Mergers for listing on Nasdaq, (3) effectiveness of the registration statement for our common stock to be issued as consideration in the Mergers, (4) the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the Mergers, (5) determinations of closing NAV in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (6) the Preferred Stock Exchange Documents by and between us and the holder of Preferred Stock remain in full force and effect as of the effective time of the Preferred Stock Exchange in accordance with the Merger Agreement and (7) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance with the covenants of each party to the Merger Agreement. Therefore, the Mergers may not be completed or may not be completed as timely as expected. 
 The closing condition that our stockholders approve the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement may not be waived and must be satisfied for the Mergers to be completed. If our stockholders do not approve the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Mergers are not completed, the resulting failure of the Mergers could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition to the required approvals of our stockholders, the Mergers are subject to a number of other conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the Mergers. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. 
 108 

We may, to the extent legally allowed, waive one or more conditions to the Mergers without resoliciting stockholder approval. 
 Certain conditions to our obligations to complete the Mergers may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally allowed, either unilaterally or by agreement with CSL III. In the event that any such waiver does not require resolicitation of stockholders, we will have the discretion to complete the Mergers without seeking further stockholder approval. The conditions requiring the approval of our stockholders, however, cannot be waived. 
 We will be subject to operational uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Mergers are pending. 
 Uncertainty about the effect of the Mergers may have an adverse effect on us and, consequently, on the combined company following completion of the Mergers. 
 These uncertainties may cause those that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking actions that we might otherwise consider to be in our best interests. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Mergers. 
 The market price of our common stock after the Mergers may be affected by factors different from those affecting our common stock currently. 
 Our business and CSL III s business differ in some respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of our common stock after the Mergers may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations and trading price of each of us and CSL III, such as a larger stockholder base and a different capital structure. Accordingly, our historical trading prices and financial results may not be indicative of these matters for the combined company following the Mergers. 
 Litigation against us, CSL III, or the members of our Board of Directors and CSL III s board of trustees, could prevent or delay the completion of the Mergers or result in the payment of damages following completion of the Mergers. 
 It is possible that lawsuits may be filed by our stockholders or CSL III s shareholders challenging the Mergers. The outcome of such lawsuits cannot be assured, including the amount of costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of these claims. If plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Mergers, such injunction may delay the consummation of the Mergers in the expected timeframe, or may prevent the Mergers from being consummated at all. Whether or not any plaintiff s claim is successful, this type of litigation can result in significant costs and divert management s attention and resources from the closing of the Mergers and ongoing business activities, which could adversely affect the operations of the Company.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 We did not sell any equity securities during the period covered in this report that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
 The following table provides information regarding purchases of our common stock made by or on behalf of the Company or any affiliated purchaser (as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the periods indicated. 
 Period 
 Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) 
 Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (1)(2) 
 Maximum (or Approximate Dollar Value) of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs July 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 42,263 August 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 42,263 September 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 42,263 Total 
 (1) On trade date basis. 
 (2) On November 4, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved the continuation of the Company's 200 million Stock Repurchase Program until November 5, 2025, or until the date the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. Pursuant to the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 200 million in the aggregate of the Company s outstanding stock in the open market and/or through privately negotiated transactions at prices not to exceed the Company s net asset value per share as reported in its most recent financial statements, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company, in its discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, available cash, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors, and may include purchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The program does not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and there can be no assurance as to the amount of shares repurchased under the program. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued by the Company at any time, subject to applicable law. Pursuant to the authorization described above, the Company adopted a 10b5-1 plan (the Company 10b5-1 Plan ). The Company 10b5-1 Plan provides that purchases will be conducted on the open market in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances. The amount of purchases made under the Company 10b5-1 Plan or otherwise and how much will be purchased at any time is uncertain, dependent on prevailing market prices and trading volumes, all of which we cannot predict. The Company's Stock Repurchase Program was originally approved by the Company's Board of Directors on November 5, 2018 and announced on November 6, 2018. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or Section 16 officer of the Company or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).
