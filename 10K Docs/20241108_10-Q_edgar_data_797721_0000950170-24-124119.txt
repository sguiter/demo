 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, in contract-related reserves for its estimate of potential refunds to customers for potential cost adjustments on several multi-year U.S. Government cost reimbursable contracts (see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies for more information). Evaluation of transaction price The evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and, where applicable, the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. The Company s contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. The Company estimates variable consideration at the amount to which it expects to be entitled. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company s anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, the Company recognizes interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, the Company utilizes the observable price of a good or service when the Company sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available.

 billion, of which the . Disaggregation of revenue The Company operates and manages its business in segments: communication services and defense and advanced technologies. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services, business line, customer type, contract type, and geographic area, as the Company believes this approach best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 11 Segment Information for disaggregation of revenue by business line and additional disaggregated revenue disclosures.

Revenues from the U.S. Government as an individual customer comprised approximately and of total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and approximately of total revenues for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues from the U.S. Government are attributable to each of the communication services segment and defense and advanced technologies segment, with slightly higher revenues from the U.S. Government reported within the Company's communication services segment for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023, and within the Company's defense and advanced technologies segment for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s communication services segment revenues are primarily derived from the Company s aviation services (including IFC services), government satcom services, maritime services (including narrowband and safety of communication capabilities), fixed broadband services, and energy services, as well as a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products, networks and terminal solutions that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services. The Company s defense and advanced technologies segment revenues are primarily derived from the Company s information security and cyber defense, space and mission systems, tactical networking, and advanced technologies and other products and services which are provided to government and commercial customers.

 of the Company s total revenues for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately and of the Company s total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, a majority of which are reported in the Company's communication services segment. The remainder of the Company s revenues for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which the Company is reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit), which contracts are mainly reported within the Company's defense and advanced technologies segment. Historically, a significant portion of the Company s revenues has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer s specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. Revenues for the Company s funded development from its customer contracts were approximately of its total revenues for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately and of its total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, mainly reported within the Company's defense and advanced technologies segment. Contract balances Contract balances consist of contract assets and contract liabilities. A contract asset, or with respect to the Company, an unbilled accounts receivable, is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of the Company s right to bill and receive consideration, typically resulting from sales under long-term contracts. Unbilled accounts receivable are generally expected to be billed and collected within one year. The unbilled accounts receivable will decrease as provided services or delivered products are billed. The Company receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule established in the Company s contracts. When consideration is received in advance of the delivery of goods or services, a contract liability, or with respect to the Company, collections in excess of revenues or deferred revenues, is recorded. Reductions in the collections in excess of revenues or deferred revenues will be recorded as the Company satisfies the performance obligations. 

Collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues 

Deferred revenues, long-term portion 

Unbilled accounts receivable increased by million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by revenue recognized in excess of billings primarily in the Company's defense and advanced technologies segment. Collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues increased by million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, driven by advances on goods or services received in excess of revenue recognized primarily in the Company's defense and advanced technologies segment. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was previously included in the Company s collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues at March 31, 2024. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was previously included in the Company s collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues at March 31, 2023 .

. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the improvement. Costs related to internally developed software for internal uses are capitalized after the preliminary project stage is complete and are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are approximately three to . Capitalized costs for internal-use software are included in property, equipment and satellites, net in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. With respect to the construction of satellites, gateway and networking equipment and other assets under construction, the Company capitalized million and million of interest expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company's complementary fleet of 21 in service or operational satellites spans the Ka-, L- and S- bands, with 11 Ka-band satellites, eight high-availability L-band satellites (three of which are contingency L-band satellites that are operational but not currently in commercial service), an S-band satellite that supports the European Aviation Network to provide IFC services to commercial airlines in Europe, and an I-6 class hybrid Ka-/L-band satellite (the I-6 F1 satellite). In late July 2024, the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite completed in-orbit testing and was integrated into the Company's existing satellite fleet covering the Americas. In August 2024, the Company launched two Ka-band highly-elliptical earth orbit satellite payloads intended to provide polar coverage (the Inmarsat GX 10A and GX 10B satellites). Furthermore, the Company has eight additional geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites under development: two additional high-capacity Ka-band GEO satellites (ViaSat-3 F2 and ViaSat-3 F3), three additional adaptive Ka-band GEO satellites (GX 7, GX 8 and GX 9) and three Inmarsat-8 L-band GEO safety service satellites. In addition to the Company's satellite fleet, the Company has purchased capacity on and has access to additional regional partner satellites. In addition, the Company owns related earth stations and networking equipment for all of its satellites. The Company procures CPE units leased to customers in order to connect to the Company's satellite network as part of the Company s communication services segment, which are reflected in investing activities and property, equipment and satellites, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company depreciates the satellites, earth stations and networking equipment, CPE units and related installation costs over their estimated useful lives. The total cost and accumulated depreciation of CPE units included in property, equipment and satellites, net, as of September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively. The total cost and accumulated depreciation of CPE units included in property, equipment and satellites, net, as of March 31, 2024 were million and million, respectively.

 of the planned throughput on the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite. On August 24, 2023, the Company reported that the I-6 F2 satellite, which was launched on February 18, 2023, suffered a power subsystem anomaly during its orbit raising phase. The Company and Airbus, the satellite's manufacturer, performed a root cause analysis of the anomaly and concluded the satellite would not operate as intended. The Company determined that the full carrying value of the I-6 F2 satellite is not recoverable. The I-6 F2 anomaly does not impact ongoing customer services. The I-6 F1 satellite, which was launched in December 2021, is operational and continues to perform as expected. As a result of the anomalies that occurred with respect to the ViaSat-3 F1 and I-6 F2 satellites, as well as the impact of integration efforts related to the Inmarsat Acquisition, the Company undertook extensive analysis of its existing integrated satellite fleet and ongoing satellites under construction projects, taking into account its anticipated future capacity needs, projected capital investment profile and access to third party satellites under existing bandwidth arrangements. Based on the impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, as a result of the anomalies experienced in the two satellites and integration impact related to the Inmarsat Acquisition, the Company recorded a reduction to the carrying value of satellites under construction (including capitalized interest) and certain related assets of billion during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (based on the Company's originally estimated ViaSat-3 F1 satellite output capabilities compared to the anticipated potential and configured capacity of the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite, the full value of the I-6 F2 satellite and the ViaSat-4 satellite program, each a separate asset group), which was partially offset by total insurance claim receivables of approximately million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. As a result, the Company recorded a net loss of approximately million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, including liabilities associated with the termination of certain subcontractor agreements, in selling, general and administrative expenses in its communication services segment in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company received approximately million and million, respectively, in insurance recovery proceeds related to such claims. The Company has received approximately million in additional insurance recovery proceeds related to such claims subsequent to quarter end. To date, the Company has received an aggregate of approximately million in insurance recovery proceeds related to such claims. Occasionally, the Company may enter into finance lease arrangements for various machinery, equipment, computer-related equipment, software, furniture, fixtures, or satellites. The Company records amortization of assets leased under finance lease arrangements within depreciation expense. The Company s finance leases consist primarily of satellite lifetime Ka-band capacity leases and have remaining terms from less than to . The Company reports assets obtained under finance leases in property, equipment and satellites, net and the current and non-current portions of its finance lease liabilities in current portion of long-term debt and other long-term debt, respectively (see Note 1 Basis of Presentation Leases for more information) .

Certain earth station leases have renewal terms that have been deemed to be reasonably certain to be exercised and as such have been recognized as part of the Company s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

 million, which was recognized as product revenue in the Company s defense and advanced technologies segment for the six months ended September 30, 2024 . In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company received a payment, of which million was recognized as product revenue in the Company s defense and advanced technologies segment and million as interest income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 . The Company may from time to time receive additional licensing and royalty payments under the settlement and licensing agreement. 

 million and million, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative for both periods. The effective tax rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a U.S. valuation allowance and foreign tax rate differences. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of million and million, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of and , respectively. The effective tax rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, in evaluating the Company s ability to realize its U.S. net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including but not limited to operating results, forecasted ranges of future taxable income, and its recent satellite anomalies. ASC 740 places more weight on the objectively verifiable evidence of current pre-tax losses and recent events than forecasts of future profitability. Therefore, the Company determined it is more likely than not that its U.S. net deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, the Company s tax benefit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 was reduced by a valuation allowance recorded against its U.S. losses for the periods. The Company's total valuation allowance increased from million at March 31, 2024 to million at September 30, 2024 relating to carryforwards for federal, state, and foreign net operating losses, federal and state R D tax credits, and foreign tax credits. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by million and million, respectively, and interest and penalties increased by million and an insignificant amount, respectively. Of the total million gross unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 , million would reduce the Company's annual effective tax rate if recognized based on the Company's valuation allowance position at September 30, 2024. 

separate segments consisting of communications services and defense and advanced technologies. The Company's segments are determined consistent with the way management currently organizes and evaluates financial information internally for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Due to the resegmentation that was implemented commencing with the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, prior period segment amounts have been recast to conform to the current segment presentation. The Company s reportable segments (communication services and defense and advanced technologies) have been determined based upon their market and economic characteristics while also giving consideration to the structure and management of various business lines. The reportable segments are primarily determined based upon industry categories and core competencies relating to product or service end market distribution, operations, and servicing and distinguished by the type of customer and, to a lesser extent, the related contractual requirements. The Company s communication services segment provides a wide range of broadband and narrowband communications solutions across government and commercial mobility markets, as well as for fixed and residential broadband customers. In addition, this segment includes the development and sale of a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products, and networks and terminal solutions that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services.

Company Overview 
 We are an innovative, global provider of communications technologies and services, focused on making connectivity accessible, available and secure for current and future customers worldwide. Our end-to-end multi-band platform of satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals enables us to provide a wide array of cost-effective, high-quality broadband, narrowband and other connectivity solutions to aviation, maritime, enterprise, consumer, military and government users around the globe, whether on the ground, in the air or at sea. In addition, our government business includes a portfolio of communications gateways; situational awareness and command and control products and services; satellite communication products and services across various frequency bands; and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services. We believe that our diversification strategy anchored in a broad portfolio of customer-centric products and services and supported by our fleet of broadband and narrowband satellites our vertical integration and our ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial applications and segments as well as across different geographic markets, provide us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies. 
 In May 2024, certain organizational changes were made that impacted our internal reporting and reportable segments. Commencing with the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we conduct our business through two reportable segments: communication services and defense and advanced technologies, which replaced our prior three reportable segments (see Note 11 Segment Information to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information). This new segment reporting structure better reflects our strategy following the Inmarsat Acquisition, diverse global end markets, and certain organizational changes, that allow us to better assess the operational performance of and allocate resources to our multiple business lines. Viasat, Inc. (Viasat) was incorporated in California in 1986, and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996. 
 Inmarsat Acquisition 
 On May 30, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Connect Topco Limited, a private company limited by shares and incorporated in Guernsey (Inmarsat Holdings and, together with its subsidiaries, Inmarsat, and such acquisition, the Inmarsat Acquisition). The assets and results of operations of Inmarsat are included in our communication services segment for the period following the closing of the Inmarsat Acquisition on May 30, 2023. 
 Communication Services 
 Our communication services segment provides a wide range of broadband and narrowband communications solutions across government and commercial mobility markets, as well as for fixed and residential broadband customers. In addition, this segment includes the development and sale of a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products and terminals that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services. We design, develop and produce space system solutions for multiple orbital regimes, including geostationary earth orbit (GEO), medium earth orbit (MEO) and low earth orbit (LEO). 
 The following are the primary business lines in our communication services segment: 
 Aviation, which includes industry-leading IFC services and wireless in-flight entertainment (W-IFE) services for commercial aircraft and private jets, narrowband safety services, and complementary aviation software services (such as cockpit, data safety and surveillance). As of September 30, 2024, we had our IFC systems installed and in service on approximately 3,900 commercial aircraft (of which approximately 80 were inactive at quarter end, mostly due to standard aircraft maintenance) and 1,920 private jets with Ka-band communication services. We anticipate that approximately 1,510 additional commercial aircraft will be put into service with our IFC systems under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines. However, due to the nature of commercial airline contracts and other factors such as OEM delays, there can be no assurance that anticipated IFC services will be activated on all such additional commercial aircraft. 

Government satcom, which includes various broadband and narrowband products and services for both fixed and mobile communications that provide military and government users with secure, high-speed, real-time broadband and multimedia connectivity in key regions of the world, as well as tactical line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) services and L-band Advanced Communications Element (LACE) terminals. 

Maritime, which includes high-quality, resilient satellite-based broadband and narrowband communications services around the globe to commercial shipping fleets, offshore service vessel operators and commercial fishing companies, as well as NexusWave, a fully managed multi-layer connectivity service for merchant shipping companies. As of September 30, 2024, we provided Ka-band communication services to approximately 14,360 vessels. 

42 

Fixed services and other, which include high-speed, high-quality, reliable fixed broadband internet services to businesses and residential users (primarily in the United States as well as in various countries in Europe and Latin America), enterprise connectivity solutions, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and other narrowband services (such as L-band managed services that enable real-time machine-to-machine (M2M) position or high-value asset tracking), energy services, and prepaid internet services that provide innovative, affordable, satellite-based connectivity in communities that have little or no access to the internet. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. fixed broadband business had approximately 228,000 subscribers with an average monthly revenue per user of 115. 

Defense and Advanced Technologies 
 Our defense and advanced technologies segment provides a diverse array of resilient, vertically integrated solutions to government and commercial customers, leveraging our core technical competencies in encryption, cyber security, tactical gateways, modems and waveforms. 
 The following are the primary business lines in our defense and advanced technologies segment: 
 Information security and cyber defense, which comprise a variety of high-quality networking, cybersecurity and information assurance products and services that provide advanced, high-speed IP-based Type 1 and High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryption (HAIPE )-compliant encryption solutions that enable military and government users to communicate information securely, and that protect the integrity of data stored on computers and storage devices and include our MOJO expeditionary tactical gateway family of products. 

Space and mission systems, which includes specialized design and technology services covering all aspects of satellite communication system architecture, networks and technology, including state-of-the-art government satellite communication systems, mobile and fixed broadband modems, ground and airborne terminals, antennas and gateways for terrestrial and satellite customer applications, Ka-band earth stations and other multi-band/multi-function antennas, as well as products designed for manpacks, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, seagoing vessels, ground-mobile vehicles, space-based systems and fixed applications. Space and mission systems also includes the design and development of the architecture of high-capacity Ka-band GEO satellites and the associated satellite payload and antenna technologies (both for our own satellite fleet as well as for third parties), and special purpose LEO and MEO satellites and other small satellite platforms. 

Tactical networking, including the provision of resilient communications designed for on-the-move or on-the-pause operations in a multi-domain battlespace with friendly force tracking and narrowband solutions. Tactical networking includes the products and services offered by TrellisWare. 

Advanced technologies and other, which includes commercial communication satellite product development, orchestration of sovereign and multi-orbit solutions, products focused on emerging growth markets (such as direct-to-device) and intellectual property licensing revenues. 

Factors and Trends Affecting our Results of Operations 
 For a summary of factors and trends affecting our results of operations, see Part II, Item 7, "Factors and Trends Affecting our Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. 
 Sources of Revenues 
 Our communication services segment revenues are primarily derived from aviation services (including IFC services), government satcom services, maritime services (including narrowband and safety of communication capabilities), fixed broadband services, and energy services, as well as a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products, networks and terminal solutions that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services. 
 Our defense and advanced technologies segment revenues are primarily derived from our information security and cyber defense, space and mission systems, tactical networking, and advanced technologies and other, products and services, which are provided to government and commercial customers. 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from two types of contracts: fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts (which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price), comprised approximately 96 of our total revenues for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 96 and 95 of our total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, a majority of which are reported in our communication services segment. The remainder of our revenues for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit), which contracts are mainly reported within our defense and advanced technologies segment. 
 43 

Historically, a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products, mainly reported within the defense and advanced technologies segment. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer s specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. See Note 1 Basis of Presentation to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 To date, our ability to grow and maintain our revenues in each of communication services and defense and advanced technologies segments has depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution, and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards. Due to the nature of this process, it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment. 
 Revenue recognition 
 We apply the five-step revenue recognition model under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (commonly referred to as ASC 606) to our contracts with our customers. Under this model, we (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify our performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price for the contract, (4) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations. These performance obligations generally include the purchase of services (including broadband capacity and the leasing of broadband equipment), the purchase of products, and the development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts. Taxes imposed by governmental authorities on our revenues, such as sales taxes and value added taxes, are excluded from net sales. 
 The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations may require judgment. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts with customers for services, primarily consisting of connectivity services. These contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. Our obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed). We evaluate whether broadband equipment provided to our customers as part of the delivery of connectivity services represents a lease in accordance with the authoritative guidance for leases (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842). As discussed in Note 1 Basis of Presentation Leases to our condensed consolidated financial statements, for broadband equipment leased to customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we account for the lease and non-lease components of connectivity service arrangements as a single performance obligation as the connectivity services represent the predominant component. 
 We also derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with customers to provide products. Performance obligations to provide products are satisfied at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These contracts typically require payment by the customer upon passage of control and determining the point at which control is transferred may require judgment. To identify the point at which control is transferred to the customer, we consider indicators that include, but are not limited to, whether (1) we have the present right to payment for the asset, (2) the customer has legal title to the asset, (3) physical possession of the asset has been transferred to the customer, (4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and (5) the customer has accepted the asset. For product revenues, control generally passes to the customer upon delivery of goods to the customer.

Our contracts with the U.S. Government typically are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments based on a percentage of the costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer can often retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables on the balance sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For our U.S. Government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our actual costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. Government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. We recognize a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues on the balance sheet. An advance payment is not typically considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. 
 Performance obligations related to developing and delivering complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts are recognized over time as these performance obligations do not create assets with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. To measure the transfer of control, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Estimating the total costs at completion of a performance obligation requires management to make estimates related to items such as subcontractor performance, material costs and availability, labor costs and productivity and the costs of overhead. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined. A one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed-price contracts as of September 30, 2024 would change our income (loss) before income taxes by an insignificant amount. 
 The evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and, where applicable, the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Our contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, we recognize interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. We have elected the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. 
 45 

If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, we utilize the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available. 
 Property, equipment and satellites 
 Property, equipment and satellites, net includes our owned and leased satellites and the associated earth stations and networking equipment, as well as the customer premise equipment units which are leased to customers as part of our communication services segment. 
 Satellites and other property and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentive payments expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers (dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites), costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. We also construct earth stations, network operations systems and other assets to support our satellites, and those construction costs, including interest, are capitalized as incurred. At the time satellites are placed in commercial service, we estimate the useful life of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite s performance against the original manufacturer s orbital design life, estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates, as well as historical satellite operating trends. We periodically review the remaining estimated useful life of our satellites to determine if revisions to the estimated useful lives are necessary. 
 Leases 
 In accordance with ASC 842, we assess at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, we determine that a lease exists when (1) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) we obtain the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset, and (3) we have the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease when one or more of the following criteria are met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (4) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset or (5) the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria. 
 At the lease commencement date, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of our incremental borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying leases. 
 Lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (1) fixed lease payments for the noncancelable lease term, (2) fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (3) variable lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of our real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate established at lease commencement. Such payments and changes in payments based on a rate or index are recognized in operating expenses when incurred. 
 46 

Lease expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the depreciation of assets obtained under finance leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense on the lease liability based on the discount rate at lease commencement. For both operating and finance leases, lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense. 
 For broadband equipment leased to customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we have made an accounting policy election not to separate the broadband equipment from the related connectivity services. The connectivity services are the predominant component of these arrangements. The connectivity services are accounted for in accordance ASC 606. We are also a lessor for certain insignificant communications equipment. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material. 
 Business combinations 
 The purchase price for business combinations is allocated to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets, and assumed liabilities, where applicable. Additionally, we recognize technology, contracts and customer relationships, orbital slots and spectrum assets, trade names and other as identifiable intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value as of the transaction date. Goodwill is recorded when consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities. Measurement-period adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill are recorded in the period they occur, which may include up to one year from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. 
 Impairment of long-lived and other long-term assets (property, equipment and satellites, and other assets, including goodwill) 
 In accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (ASC 360), we assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets, including property, equipment and satellites and other assets, when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) are less than the asset s carrying value. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value, and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. Except for the impairment related to certain of our satellites under construction and satellite programs (discussed in Note 1 Basis of Presentation Property, equipment and satellites above), no material impairments were recorded for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 We account for our goodwill under the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets (ASC 350). Current authoritative guidance allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. Alternatively, if we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, then we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to identify both the existence of an impairment and the amount of impairment loss, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. 
 In accordance with ASC 350, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The qualitative analysis includes assessing the impact of changes in certain factors including: (1) changes in forecasted operating results and comparing actual results to projections, (2) changes in the industry or our competitive environment since the acquisition date, (3) changes in the overall economy, our market share and market interest rates since the acquisition date, (4) trends in the stock price and related market capitalization and enterprise values, (5) trends in peer companies total enterprise value metrics, and (6) additional factors such as management turnover, changes in regulation and changes in litigation matters. 
 Based on our qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their related carrying value as of March 31, 2024. 
 47 

Income taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
 Management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to determine if the weight of available evidence suggests that an additional valuation allowance is needed. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes (ASC 740), net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on all the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event that our estimate of taxable income is less than that required to utilize the full amount of any deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is established, which would cause a decrease to income in the period such determination is made. 
 Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets considered historical as well as forecasted future operating results, the reversal of temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted), and the availability of tax planning strategies. Additionally, in our analysis, we also considered the fact that ASC 740 places more weight on the objectively verifiable evidence of current pre-tax losses and recent events than forecasts of future profitability. 
 Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with ASC 740. Under the authoritative guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The authoritative guidance addresses the derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business, there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision. We believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal, state and foreign tax authorities. However, if these provided amounts prove to be more than what is necessary, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, an additional charge to expense would result.

Our total revenues decreased by 103.2 million as a result of a 77.8 million decrease in product revenues and a 25.4 million decrease in service revenues. The decrease in product revenues was driven primarily by a 80.5 million decrease in our defense and advanced technologies segment (primarily the result of 95.0 million in non-recurring catch-up contributions from certain licensing agreements in advanced technologies and other received in the prior year period (see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information)), partially offset by a 2.7 million increase in our communication services segment. The decrease in service revenues was driven by decreases of 22.9 million in our communication services segment and 2.5 million in our defense and advanced technologies segment.

Cost of revenues increased by 8.8 million due to an increase of 19.3 million in cost of service revenues, partially offset by a 10.5 million decrease in cost of product revenues. The increase in cost of service revenues was primarily driven by lower margins, primarily in our communication services segment. The increase in cost of service revenues was partially offset by a decrease of 15.8 million as a result of lower service revenues, primarily reflected in our communication services segment. The decrease in cost of product revenues was primarily driven by higher margins, primarily in our defense and advanced technologies segment prior to the effects of certain intellectual property royalty and licensing revenues that had relatively low costs of product revenues (see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information). The decrease in cost of product revenues was partially offset by an increase in cost of product revenues of 18.6 million on a constant margin basis, due to increased product revenues mainly in our defense and advanced technologies segment.

The decrease in SG A expenses was also due to lower selling costs of 8.9 million, mostly reflected in our communication services segment. The decrease in SG A expenses was partially offset by an increase in support costs of 32.0 million, primarily reflected in our communications service segment. SG A expenses are comprised primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development, marketing and sales, bid and proposal, acquisition and transaction related expenses, facilities, finance, contract administration and general management.

 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 
 We amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to 20 years. The 15.4 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period was primarily related to the final valuation of certain acquired intangible assets completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, within one year of the closing of the Inmarsat Acquisition as additional information was obtained. 
 Interest income 
 The 8.6 million decrease in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower interest earned on cash invested in money market accounts as well as a result of interest income from a litigation settlement in the prior year period (see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information). 
 Interest expense 
 The 29.2 million increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized in the current year period. 
 Income taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax provision of 5.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 5 . The effective tax rate for the period differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a U.S. valuation allowance and foreign tax rate differences. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax benefit of 93.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 11 . The effective tax rate for the period differed from the U.S statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. net deferred tax assets.

Our communication services segment revenues decreased by 20.2 million due to a 22.9 million decrease in service revenues, partially offset by a 2.7 million increase in product revenues. The decrease in segment service revenues was primarily due to a 61.6 million decrease in fixed services and other (primarily related to fixed broadband services) and a 9.2 million decrease in maritime services. The decrease in segment service revenues was partially offset by a 37.9 million increase in aviation services and a 10.0 million increase in government satcom services. We continue to allocate a greater proportion of our bandwidth to our IFC business in preference to our U.S. fixed services business due to bandwidth constraints. The increase in segment product revenues was primarily due to a 10.4 million increase in fixed services and other products, mainly driven by enterprise and energy, partially offset by decreases of 3.6 million in government satcom products and 3.4 million in aviation products.

Our defense and advanced technologies segment revenues decreased by 83.0 million due to a 80.5 million decrease in product revenues and a 2.5 million decrease in service revenues. The decrease in product revenues was primarily the result of 95.0 million in non-recurring catch-up contributions from certain licensing agreements in advanced technologies and other received in the prior year period (see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information). The decrease in product revenues was also driven by a 13.5 million decrease in space and mission systems, mostly related to antenna systems products. The decrease in product revenues was partially offset by a 37.6 million increase in tactical networking products, mostly related to an increase in tactical terrestrial networking products. The decrease in service revenues was primarily driven by a 1.6 million decrease in tactical networking services.

Cost of revenues increased by 174.7 million due to a 188.2 million increase in cost of service revenues, partially offset by a 13.5 million decrease in cost of product revenues. The increase in cost of service revenues was primarily due to increased service revenues, mainly in our communication services segment, resulting in a 158.5 million increase in cost of service revenues on a constant margin basis. The cost of service revenues further increased due to lower margins, primarily reflected in our communication services segment. The higher cost of product revenues decrease relative to the product revenue decrease was primarily due to the mix of our product revenues. In the prior year period, we had a higher percent of intellectual property royalty and licensing revenues that had relatively low costs of product revenues (see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information).

The 845.0 million decrease in SG A expenses was driven primarily due to a net loss of 900.0 million related to satellite impairment, including liabilities associated with the termination of certain subcontractor agreements, net of estimated insurance claim receivables recorded in our communication services segment in the prior year period. The decrease in SG A expenses was further driven by lower selling costs of 4.2 million, primarily reflected in our defense and advanced technologies segment. The decrease was partially offset by higher support costs of 58.8 million, primarily reflected in our communication services segment.

The 9.5 million increase in IR D expenses was mainly due to increases of 6.6 million in our defense and advanced technologies segment (primarily related to tactical terrestrial networking and other advanced technologies) and 3.0 million in our communication services segment (primarily related to our mobile broadband satellite communication systems for commercial airline platforms and other communication services).The increase in our communication services segment was partially offset by a decrease in IR D expenses related to next-generation satellite payload technologies and the development of next-generation dual band mobility solutions. 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 
 We amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to 20 years. The 23.1 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in the first six months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to two full quarters of amortization of acquired intangibles assets from the Inmarsat Acquisition in May 2023, compared to only four months in the prior year period. The increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets was partially offset by the final valuation of certain acquired intangible assets completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, within one year of the closing of the Inmarsat Acquisition as additional information was obtained. 
 Interest income 
 The 5.0 million decrease in interest income for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower interest earned on cash invested in money market accounts as well as a result of interest income received from a litigation settlement in the prior year period (see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information). The decrease in interest income was partially offset by higher interest earned on cash acquired as part of the Inmarsat Acquisition. 
 Interest expense 
 The 79.0 million increase in interest expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of the effects of increased interest expense arising from our increased level of indebtedness following the closing of the Inmarsat Acquisition in May 2023. 
 53 

Income taxes 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax provision of 7.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 5 . The effective tax rate for the period differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a U.S. valuation allowance and foreign tax rate differences. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax benefit of 93.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 10 . The effective tax rate for the period differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. net deferred tax assets.

Our communication services segment revenues increased by 246.4 million due to a 250.0 million increase in service revenues, partially offset by a 3.6 million decrease in product revenues. The increase in segment service revenues was primarily due to the Inmarsat Acquisition in May 2023. The Inmarsat Acquisition contributed approximately 307.6 million to the increase in service revenues in our communication services segment, as a result of two full quarters of contribution compared to only four months in the prior year period. The inclusion of two full quarters from Inmarsat and growth in our aviation services were partially offset by an expected decrease in revenues from fixed services and other as we continued to allocate a greater proportion of our bandwidth to our IFC business in preference to our U.S. fixed services business due to bandwidth constraints. The decrease in segment product revenues was primarily driven by a 14.2 million decrease in aviation products, partially offset by a 13.6 million increase in fixed and other products, mainly driven by enterprise and energy.

The change in our communication services segment operating loss to an operating profit was primarily due to the recording of satellite impairment and related charges, net of estimated insurance claim receivables of approximately 900.0 million in the prior year period, as described above, as well as higher earnings contributions of 47.3 million, mainly due to an increase in service revenues as a result of the Inmarsat Acquisition and improved margins in our aviation services as they continued to scale. The change in our communication services segment operating loss to an operating profit was partially offset by an increase of 61.7 million in SG A expenses (reflecting the inclusion of two full quarters of Inmarsat SG A costs in the current year period compared to only four months of SG A costs in the prior year period) and a 3.0 million increase in IR D expenses (primarily related to our mobile broadband satellite communication systems for commercial airline platforms and other communication services), as noted above.

Our defense and advanced technologies segment revenues decreased by 2.8 million due to a 4.8 million decrease in product revenues, partially offset by a 2.0 million increase in service revenues. The decrease in segment product revenues was primarily the result of lower contributions from certain licensing agreements in advanced technologies and other in the current year period (see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information). The decrease in segment product revenues was also due to a 12.6 million decrease in space and mission systems, partially offset by a 71.6 million increase in tactical networking products, mostly related to an increase in tactical terrestrial networking products. The increase in service revenues was driven by a 2.8 million increase in tactical networking products.

The firm backlog does not include contract options. As of September 30, 2024, a little less than half of the firm backlog is expected to be delivered during the next 12 months, with the balance delivered thereafter. We include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders, and not anticipated purchase orders and requests. In our communication services segment, our backlog includes fixed broadband service revenues under our subscriber agreements, but does not include future recurring IFC service revenues under our agreements with commercial airlines. As of September 30, 2024, our IFC systems were installed and in service on approximately 3,900 commercial aircraft (of which approximately 80 were inactive at quarter end, mostly due to standard aircraft maintenance). We anticipate that approximately 1,510 additional commercial aircraft will be put into service with our IFC systems under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines. Due to the nature of commercial airline contracts and other factors such as OEM delays, there can be no assurance that all anticipated purchase orders and requests will be placed or that anticipated IFC services will be activated on all such additional commercial aircraft. 
 Our total new awards which exclude future revenue under recurring consumer commitment arrangements were approximately 1.3 billion and 2.4 billion for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to approximately 1.0 billion and 1.8 billion for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales. A majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer. Orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery, and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties. In addition, purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development. A failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related contract. 
 55 

Firm backlog amounts are comprised of funded and unfunded components. Funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts. Unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods. Our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long-term contracts on a periodic basis. Our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts. Although we do not control the funding of our contracts, our experience indicates that actual contract funding has ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations, bank line of credit financing, debt financing, export credit agency financing and equity financing. At September 30, 2024, we had 3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents (which included 1.94 billion in net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Inmarsat 2029 Notes, which was used, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of the outstanding Inmarsat 2026 Notes subsequent to quarter end), 1.5 billion in working capital, no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of 588.2 million under our 647.5 million revolving credit facility (the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility), and no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of 550.0 million under Inmarsat's 550.0 million revolving line of credit (the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility, and together with the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities). At March 31, 2024, we had 1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, 2.2 billion in working capital, no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of 591.5 million under the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility, and no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of 550.0 million under the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility. We invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short-term, highly liquid bank money market funds primarily investing in U.S. government-backed securities and treasuries. 
 The general cash needs of our segments can vary significantly and our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including cash required for our satellite projects and any future broadband satellite projects we may engage in, expansion of our IR D and marketing efforts, and the nature and timing of orders. In particular: 
 The cash needs of our communication services segment tend to be driven by the timing and amount of capital expenditures (e.g., payments under satellite construction and launch contracts and investments in ground infrastructure roll-out), IR D expenditures, investments in joint ventures, strategic partnering arrangements, network expansion activities, investments to obtain Supplemental Type Certificates to enable the retrofit installation of our IFC and W-IFE equipment and investments in platforms and software to support services and entry into new markets, as well as the quality of customer, type of contract, mix of contracts in backlog and payment terms, and timing and amount of recoveries under satellite insurance claims. 

In our defense and advanced technologies segment, the primary factors determining cash needs tend to be the type and mix of contracts in backlog (e.g., product or service, development or production) and timing of payments (including restrictions on the timing of cash payments under U.S. Government procurement regulations), contract duration and program performance. For example, if a program is performing well and meeting its contractual requirements, then its cash flow requirements are usually lower. 

Additionally, from time to time, we evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in complementary businesses, products and technologies which may require the use of cash or additional financing. 
 To further enhance our liquidity position or to finance the construction and launch of future satellites, acquisitions, strategic partnering arrangements, joint ventures or other business investment initiatives, we may obtain additional financing, which could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from public and/or private credit and capital markets. From time to time, we file universal shelf registration statements with the SEC for the future sale of an unlimited amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares and warrants, which securities may be offered from time to time, separately or together, directly by us, by selling security holders, or through underwriters, dealers or agents at amounts, prices, interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Additionally, we consider strategic divestitures from time to time, such as the sale of our Link-16 tactical data link business that was completed in January 2023 for approximately 1.96 billion in cash, as well as divestitures of non-core assets or businesses. 
 56 

We may, from time to time, seek to retire, prepay or repurchase our outstanding debt (including some or all of the remaining 2025 Notes) through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 359.2 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes in open market transactions, consisting of approximately 101.7 million of Inmarsat 2026 Notes and 257.5 million of 2025 Notes. As a result, we recorded a loss of approximately 3.2 million, net on extinguishment of debt in (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations, mainly related to the repurchase of Inmarsat 2026 Notes. If any of the 2025 Notes are not repurchased, we intend to redeem the remaining 2025 Notes at maturity. Although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, we believe that we have adequate sources of funding to meet our anticipated operating requirements for the next 12 months, which include, but are not limited to, cash on hand, borrowing capacity, and cash expected to be provided by operating activities. 
 Cash flows 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was 390.3 million compared to 322.6 million in the prior year period. This 67.6 million increase was driven by our operating results (net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges) which resulted in 190.3 million of higher cash provided by operating activities year-over-year, partially offset by a 122.7 million year-over-year increase in cash used to fund net operating assets. The increase in cash used to fund net operating assets during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 when compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the increase in cash tax payments related to foreign subsidiaries and the timing of payments related to our accounts payable. Cash paid for income taxes, net, during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and 2024 were 125.9 million and 58.4 million, respectively. Cash paid for interest (net of amounts capitalized) during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and 2024 were 170.4 million and 82.7 million, respectively. 
 Cash used in investing activities for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was approximately 332.3 million compared to 1.0 billion in the prior year period. This 668.7 million decrease in cash used in investing activities year-over-year reflects 342.6 million in cash (net of cash acquired) used for the Inmarsat Acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, 197.5 million of cash receipts related to satellite insurance claim proceeds received during the first six months of fiscal year 2025, and a year-over-year decrease in cash used for capital expenditures of approximately 210.8 million. 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was approximately 1.6 billion compared to 1.3 billion for the prior year period. This 300.5 million increase in cash provided by financing activities year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from debt borrowings of approximately 640.3 million, partially offset by an increase in debt repayments of approximately 355.5 million. See Note 7 Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt for further information. 
 57 

Satellite-related activities 
 Our complementary fleet of 21 in service or operational satellites spans the Ka-, L- and S- bands, with 11 Ka-band satellites, eight high-availability L-band satellites (three of which are contingency L-band satellites that are operational but not currently in commercial service), an S-band satellite that supports the European Aviation Network to provide IFC services to commercial airlines in Europe, and an I-6 class hybrid Ka-/L-band satellite (the I-6 F1 satellite). In late July 2024, the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite completed in-orbit testing and was integrated into our existing satellite fleet covering the Americas. In August 2024, we launched two Ka-band highly-elliptical earth orbit satellite payloads intended to provide polar coverage (the Inmarsat GX 10A and GX 10B satellites). Furthermore, we have eight additional GEO satellites under development: two additional high-capacity Ka-band GEO satellites (ViaSat-3 F2 and ViaSat-3 F3), three additional adaptive Ka-band GEO satellites (GX 7, GX 8 and GX 9) and three Inmarsat-8 L-band GEO safety service satellites. Our extensive satellite fleet enables us to provide a wide array of high-quality broadband and narrowband services with near global coverage (including strong oceanic coverage) with greater redundancy and resiliency. 
 We launched the first of our third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites, ViaSat-3 F1, into orbit on April 30, 2023. On July 12, 2023, we reported a reflector deployment issue that materially impacted the performance of the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite, and on August 24, 2023, we reported the I-6 F2 satellite suffered a power subsystem anomaly during its orbit raising phase, and concluded that the satellite would not operate as intended (see Note 1 Basis of Presentation Property, equipment and satellites to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information). 
 We expect to continue to invest in IR D as we continue our focus on leadership and innovation in satellite and space technologies, including for the development of any new generation satellite designs and next-generation satellite network solutions. The level of our investment in a given fiscal year will depend on a variety of factors, including the stage of development of our satellite projects, new market opportunities and our overall operating performance. 
 As we continue to build and expand our global network and satellite fleet, from time to time we enter into satellite construction agreements for the construction and purchase of additional satellites and (depending on the satellite design) the integration of our payload and technologies into the satellites. See Note 14 Commitments to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 for information regarding our future minimum payments under our satellite construction contracts and other satellite-related purchase commitments (including satellite performance incentive obligations) for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, as well as purchase commitments including satellite-related agreements under the contractual obligations table below. The total project cost to bring a new satellite into service will depend, among other things, on the scope and timing of the earth station infrastructure roll-out and the method used to procure fiber or other access to the earth station infrastructure. Our total cash funding of a satellite project may be reduced through third-party agreements, such as potential joint service offerings and other strategic partnering arrangements. 
 In connection with the launch of any new satellite and the commencement of commercial service on the satellite, we expect to incur additional operating costs that negatively impact our financial results. For example, when ViaSat-2 was placed in commercial service in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, this resulted in additional operating costs during the ramp-up period prior to service launch and in the fiscal year following service launch. These increased operating costs included depreciation, amortization of capitalized software development, earth station connectivity, marketing and advertising costs, logistics, customer care and various support systems. In addition, interest expense increased during fiscal year 2019 as we no longer capitalized the interest expense relating to the debt incurred for the construction of ViaSat-2 and the related gateway and networking equipment once the satellite was in commercial service. As services using the new satellite scaled, however, our revenue base for broadband services expanded and we gained operating cost efficiencies, which together yielded incremental segment earnings contributions. We anticipate that we will incur a similar cycle of increased operating costs and constrained bandwidth supply as we prepare for and launch commercial services on future satellites, including our ViaSat-3 constellation, followed by increases in revenue base and in scale. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in significantly increasing revenues or achieving or maintaining operating profit in our communication services segment, and any such gains may also be offset by investments in our global business. In addition, we may experience capacity constraints on our existing satellites in the lead-up to the commencement of commercial service on new satellites, such as the capacity constraints we have been experiencing since fiscal year 2023 pending our ViaSat-3 constellation entering commercial service. 
 58 

Long-term debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was 9.1 billion, which was comprised of (1) 442.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 5.625 Senior Notes due 2025, 600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 5.625 Senior Secured Notes due 2027, 400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 6.500 Senior Notes due 2028, 1.975 billion in aggregate principal amount of Inmarsat's 9.000 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the Inmarsat 2029 Notes), 733.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 7.500 Senior Notes due 2031 and 1.97 billion in aggregate principal amount of Inmarsat's 6.750 Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (which were redeemed in full with the net proceeds of the Inmarsat 2029 Notes subsequent to quarter end), (2) 686.0 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under Viasat's 700.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the 2022 Term Loan Facility), 610.5 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under Viasat's 616.7 million senior secured term loan facility (the 2023 Term Loan Facility), 1.6 billion in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under Inmarsat's 1.6 billion senior secured term loan facilities (the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities), no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities, and 29.5 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under Viasat's direct loan facility with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (the Ex-Im Credit Facility), and (3) 20.8 million of finance lease obligations. For information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, refer to Note 7 Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

(1) To the extent that the interest rate on any long-term debt is variable, amounts reflected represent estimated interest payments on the applicable current outstanding balance based on the interest rate at September 30, 2024 until the applicable maturity date, net of interest rate cap contracts (maturing in February 2025) set up to hedge the variable interest rates under the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities. The interest rate cap contracts provide protection from Compound SOFR rates over 2 and covered the total nominal amount of the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities of 1.6 billion. 

(2) Includes the Inmarsat 2026 Notes, which were redeemed in full with the net proceeds of the Inmarsat 2029 Notes on October 1, 2024, subsequent to quarter end. 

We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with subcontractors, contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. We also enter into agreements and purchase commitments with suppliers for the construction, launch, and operation of our satellites. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Consequently, only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable and unconditional commitments. We may also cancel, reschedule or adjust our requirements based on business needs after firm orders are placed at a cost, which may be material. 
 Our condensed consolidated balance sheets included 2.4 billion and 2.5 billion of other liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, which primarily consisted of deferred income taxes and the long-term portion of deferred revenues. These remaining liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and/or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2024 as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(b) other than as discussed under Contractual Obligations above or disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term and long-term obligations (including Viasat s and Inmarsat s senior secured credit facilities (collectively, the Credit Facilities) and our senior unsecured and senior secured notes (collectively, the Notes)), and interest rate cap contracts. We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our indebtedness for borrowed money comprises borrowings under our Credit Facilities and the aggregate principal amount outstanding under our Notes. The Notes and borrowings under our Ex-Im Credit Facility bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our remaining Credit Facilities, cash equivalents and short-term obligations. 
 The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain a significant amount of our cash balance in money market accounts, with a significant portion held in U.S. government-backed qualified money-market securities. In general, money market accounts are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our cash and cash equivalents earn interest at variable rates. Our interest income has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by low market interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Because our investment policy restricts us to invest in conservative, interest-bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio, we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. We therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. 
 Our primary interest rate under our variable rate Credit Facilities is the forward-looking term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility was 9.88 , and under the 2023 Term Loan Facility was 10.71 . As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average effective interest rate under the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities was approximately 9.42 . As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate that would have been applied to any new SOFR-based borrowings under the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility was approximately 7.62 , and under the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility was approximately 7.60 . As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities. Accordingly, assuming the outstanding balance under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, the 2023 Term Loan Facility and the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities remained constant over a year and we continued to have no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities, a 10 increase in the interest rates would increase interest incurred, prior to effects of capitalized interest but taking into account Inmarsat's interest rate cap contracts with respect to the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities, by approximately 21.1 million over a 12-month period. 
 We have entered into interest rate cap contracts to hedge the variable interest rates under the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities. The interest rate cap contracts provide protection from Compound SOFR rates over 2 and covered the total nominal amount of the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities of 1.6 billion. As of September 30, 2024, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the carrying and fair values of the interest rate cap contract by approximately 6.6 million. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We generally conduct our business in U.S. dollars. However, as our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A five percent variance in foreign currencies in which our international business is conducted would change our income (loss) before income taxes by an insignificant amount for each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency risk is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, from time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions. 
 61 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objective that information in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to the requirements of the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Periodically, we are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including government investigations and claims, and other claims and proceedings with respect to intellectual property, breach of contract, labor and employment, tax and other matters. Such matters could result in fines; penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages; or non-monetary relief. A violation of government contract laws and regulations could also result in the termination of our government contracts or debarment from bidding on future government contracts. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of our current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular period. For further information on the risks we face from existing and future claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, which factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the "Risk Factors" section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and such Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The risks described in our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or future results. 
 62 

Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , no director or officer, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f), or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of or any trading arrangement as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K. 
 We have entered into (or intend to enter into) a Severance Agreement and/or a Change in Control Severance Agreement, effective as of December 1, 2024, with each of our named executive officers: Mark Dankberg, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, K. Guru Gowrappan, President, Garrett L. Chase, Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Duffy, Chief Accounting Officer, Kevin Harkenrider, Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Officer and Craig Miller, President, Global Space Networks. Each of these agreements will have a term of one year, subject to automatic one-year extensions; however, the agreement with Ms. Duffy will only extend beyond December 31, 2025 upon mutual agreement, and otherwise will be a qualifying termination and termination of her role with Viasat. These Severance Agreements and Change in Control Severance Agreements will supersede any prior severance or change in control severance agreements with each of the named executive officers. 
 Pursuant to the Severance Agreements, in the event of the executive s qualifying termination, the executive will receive (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to (A) the sum of his or her annual base salary plus his or her target annual bonus, multiplied by (B) his or her severance multiple (200 in the case of Mr. Dankberg and Ms. Duffy, and 100 in the case of the other executive officers), (ii) continuation of health and other benefits for a period of 18 months following the date of termination, and (iii) accelerated vesting of a portion of the executive s outstanding equity awards (generally the portion that would have vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements during the 12 months following the date of termination). Pursuant to the Change in Control Severance Agreements, in the event of the executive s qualifying termination within the two months prior to or 18 months following a change in control of Viasat, the executive will generally receive the severance described above, except that the executive s severance multiple will be increased (to 300 in the case of Mr. Dankberg and to 200 in the case of the other executive officers) and he or she will be entitled to full vesting of any outstanding equity awards. The executives must execute a general release of claims in favor of Viasat as a condition to receiving any severance benefits. 
 The preceding descriptions of the Severance Agreements and Change in Control Severance Agreements with our executive officers do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of these agreements, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are incorporated by reference herein.

Until vested, the RSU shall be subject to forfeiture in the event of the termination of your employment or service (as applicable) with the Company and all of its Subsidiaries for any reason, whether such termination is occasioned by you, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with or without cause or by mutual agreement Termination of Employment ). Termination of Employment means the Company has determined that you have stopped providing active services to the Company Group (as defined below) (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any) and will not be extended by any notice period e.g. , active services would not include any contractual notice period or any period of garden leave or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing services for purposes of your RSU grant (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on an approved leave of absence). 

3. Transferability . Until vested, the RSU or any right or interest therein is not transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Until Common Stock is issued upon settlement of the RSU, you will not be deemed for any purpose to be, or have rights as, a Company shareholder by virtue of this award. You are not entitled to vote any shares of Common Stock by virtue of this award. 

4. Vesting . The RSU will vest and no longer be subject to the restrictions of and forfeiture under this Agreement in one-third (1/3rd or 33.33 increments on each anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the RSU shall be fully vested upon your Termination of Employment by reason of death or permanent disability.

5. Payment After Vesting . Within ten days following the vesting of the RSU, you will be issued shares of Common Stock equal to the number of vested shares, in settlement of the RSU (subject to the withholding requirements described in Section 6 below, as applicable). 

6. Withholding; Indemnity . 

(a) You understand that you (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any Tax Liability (as defined below) arising as a result of this Agreement or the transactions relating to the RSU. You agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company, any Subsidiary and your employing company (the Employer ), if different (collectively, the Company Group ), from and against any such Tax Liability. 

(b) The Company has the authority to deduct or withhold, or require you to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any Tax Liability. At any time not less than five business days before any such Tax Liability arises, you may satisfy your Tax Liability, in whole or in part, by either: (i) electing to have the Company withhold from your salary or other cash compensation payable to you or shares of Common Stock otherwise to be delivered upon settlement of the RSU with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of the Tax Liability, or (ii) paying the amount of the Tax Liability directly to the 

2 

Company in cash. Unless you choose to satisfy your Tax Liability in accordance with subsection (ii) above, your Tax Liability will be automatically satisfied in accordance with subsection (i) above. The Committee or the Board will have the right to disapprove an election to pay your Tax Liability under subsection (ii) in its sole discretion. In the event your Tax Liability will be satisfied under subsection 
 (i) above, then the Company, upon approval of the Committee or the Board, may elect (in lieu of withholding shares of Common Stock) to instruct any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on your behalf (pursuant to this authorization) a whole number of shares from those shares of Common Stock issuable to you upon settlement of the RSU as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy your Tax Liability. Your acceptance of this RSU constitutes your instruction and authorization to the Company and such brokerage firm to complete the transactions described in the previous sentence, as applicable. Such shares of Common Stock will be sold on the day the Tax Liability arises or as soon thereafter as practicable. The shares of Common Stock may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the Plan in which all participants receive an average price. You will be responsible for all broker s fees and other costs of sale, and you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed your Tax Liability, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to you as soon as practicable and you will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. You acknowledge that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy your Tax Liability. The Company may refuse to issue any Common Stock in settlement of your RSU to you until your Tax Liability is satisfied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company has the right to retain without notice from shares of Common Stock issuable under the RSU or from salary payable to you, such shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Liability. If the Company withholds less than the amount necessary to satisfy the liability, you may be required to pay any additional Tax Liability directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Employer. If the obligation for the Tax Liability is satisfied by withholding shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Liability. 
 
 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, your Tax Liability shall mean (i) all federal, state, local and foreign withholding or other taxes applicable to your taxable income, plus (ii) if permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside, any liability of the Company Group for income tax, withholding tax and any social security contributions, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account obligation or other employment related taxes in any jurisdiction, in each case that may arise as a result of (w) the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSU, (x) the issuance to you of shares of Common Stock on the vesting or settlement of the RSU, (y) the disposition of any shares of Common Stock that were the subject of the RSU, or (z) any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company may withhold for the Tax Liability by considering statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction. Further, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Liability in connection with any aspect of the RSU, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSU, the subsequent sale of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSU to reduce or eliminate your Tax Liability or achieve any particular tax result. You further acknowledge that if you are subject to a Tax Liability in more than one jurisdiction, the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax Liability in more than one jurisdiction.

Consequently, you understand that any grant is given on the assumption and condition that it shall not become a part of any employment or service contract (either with the Company or any Subsidiary) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purpose (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. Further, you understand and freely accept that there is no guarantee that any benefit shall arise from any gratuitous and discretionary grant since the future value of the RSUs and shares of Common Stock is unknown and unpredictable.

Consequently, upon Termination of Employment for any of the above reasons, you will automatically lose any rights to RSUs granted to you that were unvested on the date of Termination of Employment, as described in the Agreement. 
 
 You acknowledge that you have read and specifically accepts the conditions referred to in Section 7 of the Agreement.

 10.12 	 Section 409A . To the extent that the Committee determines that any award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the award agreement evidencing such award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section 409A of the Code. To the extent applicable, the Plan and award agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance (including Department of Treasury guidance), the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable award agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance.

 	10.14	 Stockholder Approval Not Required . It is expressly intended that approval of the Company s stockholders not be required as a condition of the effectiveness of the Plan, and the Plan s provisions shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent for all purposes.

Awards under the Plan will be approved by (a) the Committee comprised entirely of Independent Directors or (b) a majority of the Company s Independent Directors. Accordingly, pursuant to Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635(c)(4), the issuance of awards and the shares of Stock issuable upon exercise or vesting of such awards pursuant to the Plan are not subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders. 
 
 19 

10.15	 Clawback Provisions . All awards (including, without limitation, any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by an Optionee, Grantee or Restricted Stockholder upon any receipt or exercise of any award or upon the receipt or resale of any shares of Common Stock underlying the award) shall be subject to the provisions of any clawback policy implemented by the Company, including, without limitation, any clawback policy adopted to comply with applicable law (including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder), as and to the extent set forth in such clawback policy or the applicable award agreement. No recovery of compensation under such a clawback policy will be an event giving rise to a right to resign for good reason or constructive termination (or similar term) under any agreement between an Optionee, Grantee or Restricted Stockholder and the Company or any affiliate. 
 
 10.16	 No Right to Continued Employment . Nothing in this Plan or in any award agreement hereunder shall confer upon any Optionee any right to continue in the employ of, or as a consultant for, the Company or any Subsidiary, or as a Director of the Company, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and any Subsidiary, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any Optionee, Grantee or Restricted Stockholder at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. As consideration for the granting of an award under the Plan, the Committee may require the Optionee, Grantee or Restricted Stockholder to agree, in the written award agreement, to remain in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary for such period after the date of grant as may be fixed in the award agreement or by action of the Committee following grant of the award.

If Executive is a specified employee (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, on the date of Executive s Separation from Service, to the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are subject to Section 409A of the Code and the delayed payment or distribution of all or any portion of such amounts to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such portion deferred pursuant to this Section 7(h)(ii) shall be paid or distributed to Executive in a lump sum on the earlier of (A) the date that is six (6)-months following Executive s Separation from Service, (B) the date of Executive s death or (C) the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Any remaining payments due under the Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. 
 			(iii)	To the extent that any payments or reimbursements provided to Executive under this Agreement are deemed to constitute compensation to Executive to which Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) would apply, such amounts shall be paid or reimbursed reasonably promptly, but not later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of any such payments eligible for reimbursement in one year shall not affect the payments or expenses that are eligible for payment or reimbursement in any other taxable year, and Executive s right to such payments or reimbursement of any such expenses shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
 			(iv)	To the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A, if the period during which Executive may execute the Release spans two calendar years, the payment of any such payments or benefits shall occur (or commence) on the later of (A) January 1 of the second calendar year, or (B) on the date specified in Section 3(a).

 (j)	 Consultation with Legal and Financial Advisors . By executing this Agreement, Executive acknowledges that this Agreement confers significant legal rights, and may also involve the waiver of rights under other agreements; that the Company has encouraged Executive to consult with 
 10 

Executive s personal legal and financial advisors; and that Executive has had adequate time to consult with Executive s advisors before executing this Agreement.

5 

in the maximum economic benefit to Executive on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. 

(ii)	All determinations regarding the application of this Section 3(g) shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the 280G Firm ). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (A) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (B) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (C) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.

In addition, Executive acknowledges receipt of the following notice of immunity rights under the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act, which states: (1) An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (2) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose a trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal, and (B) does not disclose a trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

5.	 Arbitration .

Sec. 1, et seq. A copy of the JAMS Streamlined Rules may be found on the JAMS website at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ and will be provided to Executive by the Company upon request. BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROCEDURE, EXECUTIVE AND THE COMPANY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE, CLAIM OR DEMAND THROUGH A TRIAL BY JURY OR JUDGE OR BY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION. The arbitrator shall administer and conduct any arbitration in accordance with the applicable governing law as provided in Section 7(d) below and shall apply the substantive and procedural laws of such jurisdiction to any such dispute, claim or demand, without reference to any conflict-of-law provisions of any jurisdiction. To the extent that the JAMS Rules conflict with such governing law, California law shall take precedence. The parties agree that the prevailing party in any arbitration shall be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either Executive or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to applicable law to prevent irreparable harm (including, without limitation, pending the conclusion of any arbitration). The arbitrator may award attorney s fees and costs to the prevailing party, except as prohibited by law. This Section 5 is not applicable to Executive if he or she is employed outside the United States. 
 6. 	 At-Will Employment Relationship .

Any change to the at-will employment relationship must be by specific, written agreement signed by Executive and an authorized representative of the Company. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or should be 
 7 

construed to contradict, modify or alter this at-will relationship. This Section 6 is not applicable to Executive if he or she is employed outside the United States under country specific terms and conditions. 
 
 7. 	 General Provisions . 
 
 (a)	 Successors and Assigns . The rights of the Company under this Agreement may, without the consent of Executive, be assigned by the Company, in its sole and unfettered discretion, to any person, firm, corporation or other business entity which at any time, whether by purchase, merger or otherwise, directly or indirectly, acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company. The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; provided , however , that no such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder; provided , further , that the failure of any such successor to so assume this Agreement shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise. Executive shall not be entitled to assign any of Executive s rights or obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. 
 
 (b)	 Severability . In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to allow enforceability of the provision as so limited, it being intended that the parties shall receive the benefit contemplated herein to the fullest extent permitted by law. If a deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such arbitrator or court, the unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby. 
 
 (c)	 Interpretation; Construction . The headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be used in interpreting this Agreement. This Agreement has been drafted by legal counsel representing the Company, but Executive has participated in the negotiation of its terms. Furthermore, Executive acknowledges that Executive has had an opportunity to review and revise the Agreement and have it reviewed by legal counsel, if desired, and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement. Either party s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, or prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. 
 
 (d)	 Governing Law and Venue . This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California applicable to contracts made and to be performed wholly within such State, and without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive is employed outside of the United States, this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Executive is employed as of the date Executive signs this Agreement.

8 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
 	BEING AWARE OF SAID CODE SECTION, THE EXECUTIVE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS HE MAY HAVE THEREUNDER, AS WELL AS UNDER ANY OTHER STATUTES OR COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES OF SIMILAR EFFECT. 
 3. No Assignment or Transfer of Claims . The Executive represents and warrants to the Company Releasees that there has been no assignment or other transfer of any interest in any Claim that the Executive may have against the Company Releasees. The Executive agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company Releasees from any liability, claims, demands, damages, costs, expenses, and attorneys fees incurred as a result of any such assignment or transfer from the Executive. 

4. Confirmation of Continuing Obligations . 

(a) The Executive hereby expressly reaffirms his obligations under that certain Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement executed by the Executive in connection with his employment with the Company (the Proprietary Information Agreement ), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference, and agrees that such obligations shall survive the Last Day of Service. 

(b) By signing below, the Executive agrees that, no later than the Last Day of Service, he will deliver to the Company any and all drawings, notes, memoranda, specifications, devices, formulas, and documents, together with all copies thereof, and any other material containing or disclosing any Company Inventions, Third Party Information or Proprietary Information (each as defined in the Proprietary Information Agreement) of the Company. The Executive further agrees that any property situated on the Company s premises and owned by the Company, including computers, hard drives, and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any time with or without notice. The Executive s compliance with this Section 5(b) shall be a condition to his receipt of the payments and benefits set forth in Sections 1(b) and 2. The Executive will deliver all applicable Company property back to the Company by using a prepaid box that will be shipped to the Executive s address or by leaving any property that it wasn t agreed that the Executive would retain in the Executive s office on or prior to the Last Day of Service. 

(c) Subject to Section 5(f), the Executive agrees that the Executive will not make any negative or disparaging statements or comments, either as fact or as opinion, about the Company or its subsidiaries or their employees, officers, directors, shareholders, vendors, products or services, business, technologies, market position or performance. Nothing in this Section 5(c) will prohibit the Executive or the Company from providing truthful information in response to a subpoena or other legal process or governmental inquiry, or from exercising any other protected right that cannot be waived by agreement. 

9 

(d) The receipt of the payments and benefits set forth in Sections 1(b) and 2 shall be subject to the Executive not violating the provisions of this Agreement or the Proprietary Information Agreement or any other similar restrictive covenant or proprietary information agreement to which the Executive is a party with the Company or any of its affiliates . In the event the Executive breaches the provisions of this Agreement or the Proprietary Information Agreement, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to the Company under law or in equity, all continuing payments and benefits to which the Executive may otherwise be entitled pursuant to Section 2(b) shall be immediately suspended. 

(e) The Executive understands that nothing in this Agreement prohibits or is intended to limit the Executive from (i) communicating directly with, reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to, filing a charge with, providing information to, receiving financial awards from, or participating or cooperating in an investigation conducted by or any action or proceeding filed by any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. National Labor Relations board, the U.S. Congress, and any U.S. Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation; provided, however, that the Executive expressly waives and relinquishes any rights the Executive might have to recover damages or other relief, whether equitable or legal, in any Equal Employment Opportunity Commission proceeding (whether brought by the Executive or on the Executive s behalf), (ii) exercising any rights the Executive may have under Section 7 of the U.S. National Labor Relations Act, such as the right to engage in concerted activity, including collective action or discussion concerning wages or working conditions; or (iii) discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination based on a protected characteristic or any other conduct that the Executive has reason to believe is unlawful. In addition, the Executive acknowledges receipt of the following notice of immunity rights under the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act, which states: (1) An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (2) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose a trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal, and (B) does not disclose a trade secret, except pursuant to court order. The Executive does not need the prior authorization of the Company to make any such reports or disclosures or to participate or cooperate in any governmental investigation, action or proceeding, and the Executive is not required to notify the Company that the Executive has made such reports and disclosures or has participated or cooperated in any governmental investigation, action or proceeding. 

5. Additional Representations and Warranties by Executive. The Executive promises and represents that the Executive has not filed any lawsuit against the Company and/or the Company Releasees, and that the Executive has not filed or submitted any complaint or charge against the Company and/or the Company Releasees with any government agency (including but 

10 

not limited to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Department of Labor, the California Labor Commissioner or Department of Labor Standards Enforcement, and/or the California Labor Workforce Development Agency). Subject to Section 5(f) above, the Executive further represents that Executive will not in the future, file, participate in, encourage, instigate, or assist in the prosecution of any claims, complaints, charges or in any lawsuit by any party in any state or federal court against the Company Releasees, or any of them, unless such aid or assistance is ordered by a court or government agency or sought by compulsory legal process, claiming that the Company Releasees, or any of them, have violated any local, state, or federal laws, statutes, ordinances, or regulations based upon events occurring prior to the execution of this Agreement. 

6. Cooperation . For up to two years following the Last Day of Service, the Executive will reasonably cooperate in connection with any litigation, arbitration, proceedings, government hearing or investigation involving the Company or any other matter that relates to the Executive s employment period and about which the Executive has knowledge; provided, however, that such cooperation shall be provided at times that are mutually convenient to the Executive and the Company, and the Company shall make good faith efforts to arrange for such cooperation to be provided by the Executive telephonically. The Company will provide the Executive with reasonable advanced notice in the event Executive s assistance is required. The Company recognizes that the Executive s ability to cooperate will necessarily be impacted by other personal, professional, and work obligations. The Company will reimburse Executive for reasonable expenses incurred in providing such cooperation and will reasonably compensate Executive for his time based on Executive s hourly rate with the Company as of the Last Day of Service. 

7. Best Pay Provision . 

(a) In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of the Executive s employment) (each a Payment ), would (A) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (B) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then such Payment shall be either (1) the full amount of such Payment or (2) such lesser amount (with cash payments being reduced before stock option compensation) as would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in Executive s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the Payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction of any Payment(s) is required, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Payments by first reducing or eliminating any cash payments under this Agreement, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments which are to be paid the farthest in time from the date of the transaction triggering the Excise Tax. 

(b) All determinations required to be made under this Section 8, including whether and to what extent the Payments shall be reduced and the assumptions to be utilized in 

11 

arriving at such determination, shall be made by the nationally recognized certified public accounting firm used by the Company immediately prior to the effective date of the applicable change in ownership or control or, if such firm declines to serve, such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company (the Accounting Firm ). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to Executive and the Company at such time as is requested by the Company. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Executive and the Company. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 8, the Accounting Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good-faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. 

8. Survival . The covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties contained in or made in this Agreement shall survive the Last Day of Service or any termination of this Agreement. 

9. Third-Party Beneficiaries . Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not create, and shall not be construed as creating, any rights enforceable by any person not a party to this Agreement. 

10. Waiver . The failure of either party hereto at any time to enforce performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect such party s rights thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall the waiver by either party of any breach of any provision hereof be deemed to be a waiver by such party of any other breach of the same or any other provision hereof. 

11. Notices . Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered as follows with notice deemed given as indicated: (a) by personal delivery when delivered personally; (b) by overnight courier upon written verification of receipt; (c) by email, telecopy or facsimile transmission upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic transmission; or (d) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon verification of receipt.

To aid in the rapid and economical resolution of any disputes that may arise from this Agreement and the terms of it, the Executive and the Company agree that any and all disputes, claims, or demands in any way arising out of or relating to the terms of this Agreement, Company equity held by the Executive, the Executive s further employment relationship with the Company, or the termination of the Executive s employment or service relationship with the Company, shall be resolved by final, binding and confidential arbitration in San Diego County, California, conducted before a single neutral arbitrator selected and administered in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (the JAMS Streamlined Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1, et seq. A copy of the JAMS Streamlined Rules may be found on the JAMS website at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ and will be provided to Executive by the Company upon request. BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROCEDURE, EXECUTIVE AND THE COMPANY WAIVE THE RIGHT 

12 

TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE, CLAIM OR DEMAND THROUGH A TRIAL BY JURY OR JUDGE OR BY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION. The arbitrator shall administer and conduct any arbitration in accordance with California law and shall apply substantive and procedural California law to any such dispute, claim or demand, without reference to any conflict-of-law provisions of any jurisdiction. To the extent that the JAMS Rules conflict with California law, California law shall take precedence. The Parties agree that the prevailing party in any arbitration shall be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either the Executive or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to applicable law to prevent irreparable harm (including, without limitation, pending the conclusion of any arbitration). The arbitrator may award attorney s fees and costs to the prevailing party, except as prohibited by law. 

13. Interpretation; Construction . The headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be used in interpreting this Agreement. This Agreement has been drafted by legal counsel representing the Company, but the Executive has participated in the negotiation of its terms. Furthermore, the Executive acknowledges that the Executive has had an opportunity to review this Agreement and have it reviewed by legal counsel, if desired, and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement. Either Party s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, or prevent that Party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. 

14. Withholding and Other Deductions; Right to Seek Independent Advice . All compensation payable to the Executive hereunder shall be subject to such deductions as the Company is from time to time required to make pursuant to law, governmental regulation, or order. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor the Company s counsel has provided any legal or tax advice to the Executive and that the Executive is free to, and is hereby advised to, consult with a legal or tax advisor of his choosing. 

15. Section 409A . 

(a) The Executive s termination of employment on the Last Day of Service will constitute Executive s separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and the final regulations and any guidance promulgated thereunder Section 409A ). 

(b) This Agreement is not intended to provide for any deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, and, accordingly, the severance payments payable under Section 2(b) shall be paid no later than the later of: (A) the fifteenth (15 th day of the third month following the Executive s first taxable year in which such severance benefit is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, and (B) the fifteenth (15 th day of the third month following first taxable year of the Company in which such severance benefit is no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, as determined in accordance with Code Section 409A and any Treasury Regulations and other guidance issued thereunder. To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive 

13 

guidance issued thereunder. Any right to a series of installment payments pursuant to this Agreement is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. 

(c) If the Executive is a specified employee (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, on the date of the Executive s separation from service, to the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are subject to Section 409A of the Code and the delayed payment or distribution of all or any portion of such amounts to which the Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such portion deferred pursuant to this Section 16(c) shall be paid or distributed to the Executive in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the date that is six (6)-months following the Executive s Separation from Service, (ii) the date of the Executive s death or (iii) the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Any remaining payments due under the Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. 

(d) To the extent that any payments or reimbursements provided to the Executive under this Agreement are deemed to constitute compensation to the Executive to which Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) would apply, such amounts shall be paid or reimbursed reasonably promptly, but not later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of any such payments eligible for reimbursement in one year shall not affect the payments or expenses that are eligible for payment or reimbursement in any other taxable year, and the Executive s right to such payments or reimbursement of any such expenses shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 

(e) The Executive agrees and acknowledges that the Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to the application of Section 409A and other tax consequences to any payments hereunder and, by the acceptance of any such payments, the Executive agrees to accept the potential application of Section 409A and the other tax consequences of any payments made hereunder. In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or interest that may be imposed on the Executive pursuant to Section 409A or under any other similar provision of state tax law, including but not limited to, damages for failing to comply with Section 409A and/or any other similar provision of state tax law. 

16. Successors and Assigns . The rights of the Company under this Agreement may, without the consent of Executive, be assigned by the Company, in its sole and unfettered discretion, to any person, firm, corporation or other business entity which at any time, whether by purchase, merger or otherwise, directly, or indirectly, acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company. The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; provided, however, that no such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder; provided, further, that the failure of any such successor to so assume this Agreement shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise. The Executive shall not be entitled to assign any of the Executive s rights or obligations under this 

14 

Agreement, other than the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. 

17. Severability . In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to allow enforceability of the provision as so limited, it being intended that the parties shall receive the benefit contemplated herein to the fullest extent permitted by law. If a deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such arbitrator or court, the unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby. 

18. Governing Law and Venue . This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the State of California applicable to contracts made and to be performed wholly within such State, and without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.

Each party hereby agrees that any such court shall have in personam jurisdiction over it and consents to service of process in any manner authorized by California law. 

19. Entire Agreement . This Agreement, the Proprietary Information Agreement, that certain Indemnification Agreement executed by Executive in connection with his employment with the Company and attached hereto as Exhibit C (the Indemnification Agreement ), and the other agreements referenced herein and therein, constitute the entire agreement of the Parties in respect of the subject matter contained herein and therein and supersedes all prior or simultaneous representations, discussions, negotiations and agreements, whether written or oral, including, without limitation, any offer letter with the Company, the Severance Agreement and the Change in Control Agreement.
