 Overview 
 We have a diverse portfolio of iconic and market-leading hotels and resorts with significant underlying real estate value. We currently have interests in 41 hotels, consisting of premium-branded hotels and resorts with over 25,000 rooms, of which over 86 are luxury and upper upscale (as defined by Smith Travel Research) and are located in prime U.S. markets and its territories. Our high-quality portfolio currently includes hotels mostly in major urban and convention areas, such as New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Boston, New Orleans and Denver; and premier resorts in key leisure destinations, including Hawaii, Orlando, Key West and Miami Beach; as well as hotels in select airport and suburban locations. 
 Our objective is to be the preeminent lodging real estate investment trust REIT ), focused on consistently delivering superior, risk-adjusted returns to stockholders through active asset management and a thoughtful external growth strategy while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. As a pure-play real estate company with direct access to capital and independent financial resources, we believe our enhanced ability to implement compelling return on investment initiatives within our portfolio represents a significant embedded growth opportunity. Finally, given our scale and investment expertise, we believe we will be able to successfully execute single-asset and portfolio acquisitions and dispositions to further enhance the value and diversification of our assets throughout the lodging cycle, including potentially taking advantage of the economies of scale that could come from consolidation in the lodging REIT industry. 
 We operate our business through two operating segments, our consolidated hotels and unconsolidated hotels. Our consolidated hotels operating segment is our only reportable segment. Refer to Note 11: "Business Segment Information"

 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our operating segments. 
 Outlook 
 Economic disruptions, including as a result of elevated interest rates and elevated rates of inflation, may adversely affect our business by affecting consumer sentiment and demand for travel. However, inflationary concerns have moderated and expectations of further interest rate reductions continue. In addition, we are experiencing near-term disruption related to negotiations between our third-party operators and unions at certain hotels, which includes strikes and other labor activity and may include increases in labor or other costs to maintain or operate hotels during a labor disruption. We have relied on the performance of our hotels and active asset management to mitigate the effects of current macroeconomic uncertain ty and disruption from union activity. During the third quarter of 2024, we continued to experience improvements in overall demand across our portfolio, although average daily rate ("ADR") growth has slowed as the industry recovery has stabilized and seasonal patterns have normalized. While there can be no assurances that we will not experience further fluctuations in hotel revenues or earnings at our hotels due to inflation and other macroeconomic factors, local economic factors and demand, a potential economic slowdown or a recession and geopolitical conflicts , we expect the positive momentum to continue for the remainder of 2024 based on current demand trends, expected increases in city-wide events and as demand from international travel continues to improve. 
 Recent Events 
 In July 2024, the unconsolidated joint venture that owns and operates the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines sold the hotel for gross proceeds of approximately 165 million, and our pro-rata share of the gross proceeds was approximately 41 million, which was reduced by our portion of debt of approximately 17 million. We recognized a gain of approximately 19 million, which is included in equity in earnings from investments in affiliates in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Additionally, in August 2024, we permanently closed the Hilton Oakland Airport and subsequently terminated its ground lease, returning the property to the ground lessor. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of 35 million. 
 
 Key Business Metrics Used by Management 
 Occupancy 
 Occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity. We use occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help us determine achievable ADR levels as demand for rooms increases or decreases. 
 Average Daily Rate 
 ADR represents rooms revenue divided by total number of room nights sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the hotel industry, and we use ADR to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates have a more pronounced effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above. 
 Revenue per Available Room 
 Revenue per available room ("RevPAR") represents rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key factors of operations at a hotel or group of hotels: occupancy and ADR. RevPAR is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods.

 Comparable Hotels Data 
 We present certain data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis as supplemental information for investors. We present comparable hotel results to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing performance of our comparable hotels. Our comparable hotels data includes results from hotels that were active and operating in our portfolio since January 1st of the previous year and excludes results from property dispositions that have occurred through September 30, 2024 and the Hilton San Francisco Hotels, which were placed into receivership at the end of October 2023. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We also evaluate the performance of our business through certain other financial measures that are not recognized under U.S. GAAP. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit and net income (loss). 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA, presented herein, reflects net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest income, interest expense, income taxes and also interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings from investments in affiliates. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, presented herein, is calculated as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude the following items that are not reflective of our ongoing operating performance or incurred in the normal course of business, and thus, excluded from management's analysis in making day-to-day operating decisions and evaluations of our operating performance against other companies within our industry: 
 Gains or losses on sales of assets for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; 
 Costs associated with hotel acquisitions or dispositions expensed during the period; 
 Severance expense; 
 Share-based compensation expense; 
 Impairment losses and casualty gains or losses; and 
 Other items that we believe are not representative of our current or future operating performance. 
 Hotel Adjusted EBITDA measures hotel-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses for our consolidated hotels, which excludes hotels owned by unconsolidated affiliates, and is a key measure of our profitability. We present Hotel Adjusted EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our consolidated hotels. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures used by our management team to make day-to-day operating decisions and evaluate our operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the effect of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results; and (ii) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other methods of analyzing our operating performance and results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense; 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our income tax expense; 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; and 
 other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 We do not use or present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA as measures of our liquidity or cash flow. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow or other methods of analyzing our cash flows and liquidity as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Some of these limitations are: 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

 Nareit FFO attributable to stockholders and Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders 
 We present Nareit FFO attributable to stockholders and Nareit FFO per diluted share (defined as set forth below) as non-GAAP measures of our performance. We calculate funds from (used in) operations FFO attributable to stockholders for a given operating period in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ), as net income (loss) attributable to stockholders (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on sales of assets, impairment, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis. As noted by Nareit in its December 2018 Nareit Funds from Operations White Paper 2018 Restatement, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, Nareit adopted the FFO metric in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We believe Nareit FFO provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs. Our presentation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the terms in accordance with the current Nareit definition, or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently than we do. We calculate Nareit FFO per diluted share as our Nareit FFO divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during a given operating period. 
 We also present Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders and Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance and in our annual budget process. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance. We adjust Nareit FFO attributable to stockholders for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders: 
 Costs associated with hotel acquisitions or dispositions expensed during the period; 
 Severance expense; 
 Share-based compensation expense; 
 Casualty gains or losses; and 
 Other items that we believe are not representative of our current or future operating performance.

 Results of Operations 
 Our non-comparable hotels consist of one hotel sold and two hotels returned to the lessor upon termination of the ground leases since January 1, 2023. The results of operations of these hotels are included in our consolidated results only during our period of ownership. Additionally, our non-comparable hotels also consist of the two Hilton San Francisco Hotels, which are excluded from our consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the hotels being placed into receivership in October 2023, which had a significant effect on the year-over-year comparability of our operations as further illustrated in the table of Hotel Revenues and Operating Expenses below.

 Market-Specific Conditions 
 
 The increases in hotel revenues and operating expenses for our comparable hotels during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily attributable to our hotels in the Orlando, Key West, Chicago, New Orleans, Boston and New York markets. 
 Our Orlando hotels both benefited from an increase in group demand after the completion of the ballroom expansion project in early 2024, resulting in increases in occupancy and ADR of 1.4 percentage points and 7.0 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 3.3 percentage points and 6.9 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 at the Signia by Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek. The Waldorf Astoria Orlando benefited from increases in both group and transient demand, resulting in increases in occupancy and ADR of 17.0 percentage points and 6.9 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.9 percentage points and 4.3 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 The increases in the Key West market were driven by the Casa Marina Key West, Curio Collection, which was closed during the entirety of the third quarter of 2023 for a comprehensive renovation of the hotel that started in May 2023 when the hotel suspended operations, with all rooms reopening by December 2023. 
 The Hilton Chicago and the Hilton New Orleans Riverside both benefited from increased group demand, with occupancy and ADR at the Hilton Chicago increasing 12.9 percentage points and 0.9 , respectively, for the three months

 ended September 30, 2024 and 6.7 percentage points and 0.2 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Occupancy and ADR at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside increased 7.9 percentage points and 10.1 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 3.5 percentage points and 2.3 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Combined occupancy and ADR at our Boston hotels increased 1.5 percentage points and 5.2 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.9 percentage points and 4.6 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due to increases in transient demand. 
 The New York Hilton Midtown benefited from increases in group and transient demand, resulting in increases in occupancy and ADR of 2.1 percentage points and 1.3 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while occupancy and ADR remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 These increases were partially offset by decreases in hotel revenues and operating expenses at our two Hawaii hotels where combined occupancy decreased 5.0 percentage points and 3.1 percentage points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to a decrease in transient demand.

 Impairment and casualty loss 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized impairment losses of approximately 12 million related to two of our hotels subject to ground leases and our inability to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining lease term. Refer to Note 7: "Fair Value Measurements" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an impairment loss of approximately 202 million. Refer to Note 7: "Fair Value Measurements" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Gain on sale of assets, net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a net gain of 15 million from the sale of one consolidated hotel. 
 Gain on derecognition of assets 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of 15 million and 44 million, respectively, from the accrued interest expense associated with the default of the SF Mortgage Loan, which resulted in a corresponding increase of the contract asset in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, as we expect to be released from this obligation upon final resolution with the lender.

 Non-operating Income and Expenses 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased 3 million and 13 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily as a result of a decrease in average cash balances. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased 3 million and 6 million, respectively during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the issuance of the 550 million of senior notes due in 2030 ("2030 Senior Notes") and the 200 million senior unsecured term loan facility due May 2027 ("2024 Term Loan"), partially offset by the repurchase and redemption of all the 650 million senior notes due in 2025 ("2025 Senior Notes"). Interest expense associated with our debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Interest expense associated with hotels in receivership 
 Interest expense on the SF Mortgage Loan increased 1 million and 13 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to accrued default interest beginning in June 2023 when we ceased making payments on the loan. The stated rate on the loan is 4.11 , however, beginning June 1, 2023, the default interest rate on the loan is 7.11 . Additionally, beginning June 1, 2023, the loan accrues a monthly late payment administrative fee of 3 of the monthly amount due. 
 Other (loss) gain, net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss of approximately 4 million, which was primarily related to the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repurchase and redemption of all the 2025 Senior Notes. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of approximately 4 million for an early termination fee received from the lessor to terminate the lease for the Embassy Suites Phoenix Airport hotel.

 Equity in earnings from investments in affiliates 
 Equity in earnings from investments in affiliates increased 26 million and 20 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a 19 million gain from the sale of the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. 
 Income tax (expense) benefit 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized income tax expense of 2 million, which was primarily related to taxable income from our TRSs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of 9 million, which was primarily associated with the effective exit from the Hilton San Francisco Hotels and the reversal of 14 million of tax expense that is no longer expected to be incurred. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized income tax expense of 5 million, which was primarily related to taxable income from our TRSs. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We seek to maintain sufficient amounts of liquidity with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility. As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 480 million and 38 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash primarily consists of cash restricted as to use by our debt agreements and reserves for capital expenditures in accordance with certain of our management agreements. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we continued to experience improvements in overall demand across our portfolio and expect the improvement to continue through the remainder of 2024 based on current demand trends, including an increase in city-wide events and from international travel. We continue to mitigate the effects of macroeconomic and inflationary pressures through active asset management. 
 With approximately 950 million available under our Revolver and 480 million in existing cash and cash equivalents, we have sufficient liquidity to pay our debt maturities and to fund other liquidity obligations over the next 12 months and beyond. Excluding the SF Mortgage Loan for which we ceased to make debt service payments in June 2023 and is in default, and following the issuance of the 2030 Senior Notes and borrowings under the 2024 Term Loan, the proceeds from which collectively were used to repurchase or redeem all of the 2025 Senior Notes and for other general corporate purposes, we have no significant maturities until the fourth quarter of 2026. Refer to Note 6: "Debt" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. We may also take actions to improve our liquidity, such as the issuance of additional debt, equity or equity-linked securities, if we determine that doing so would be beneficial to us. However, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance, which may be in the near term, or that any such additional financing will be completed on favorable terms, or at all. 
 Our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures, including reimbursements to our hotel manager for payroll and related benefits, costs associated with the operation of our hotels, interest and contractually due principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures for in-progress renovations and maintenance at our hotels, corporate general and administrative expenses and dividends to our stockholders. In July 2024, we declared a third quarter dividend of 0.25 per share that was paid on October 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2024. Many of the other expenses associated with our hotels are relatively fixed, including portions of rent expense, property taxes and insurance. Since we generally are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have a greater adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins and profits. Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities, capital improvements at our hotels, and costs associated with potential acquisitions. 
 Our commitments to fund capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at our hotels will be funded by cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash to the extent permitted by our lending agreements and cash flow from operations. We have construction contract commitments of approximately 113 million for capital expenditures at our properties, of which 34 million relates to guestroom renovations at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort, 19 million relates to guestroom renovations at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and 6 million relates to guestroom renovations at the 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Hilton New Orleans Riverside. Our contracts contain clauses that allow us to cancel all or some portion of the work. Additionally, we have established reserves for capital expenditures FF E reserve in accordance with our management and certain debt agreements. Generally, these agreements require that we fund 4 of hotel revenues into an FF E reserve, unless such amounts have been incurred. 
 Our cash management objectives continue to be to maintain the availability of liquidity, minimize operational costs, make debt payments and fund our capital expenditure programs and future acquisitions. Further, we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In February 2023, our Board of Directors authorized and approved a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to 300 million of our common stock over a two-year period ending in February 2025, subject to any applicable limitations or restrictions set forth in our credit facility and indentures related to our Senior Notes. Stock repurchases may be made through open market purchases, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading programs, in privately negotiated transactions, or in such other manner that would comply with applicable securities laws. The timing of any future stock repurchases and the number of shares to be repurchased will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors, and we may suspend the repurchase program at any time. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million and 4.2 million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of 35 million and 60 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 90 million remained available for stock repurchases. 
 Sources and Uses of Our Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The following tables summarize our net cash flows and key metrics related to our liquidity: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Percent Change (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 349 377 (7.4) Net cash used in investing activities (134) (91) 47.3 Net cash used in financing activities (447) (439) 1.8 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flow from operating activities are primarily generated from the operating income generated at our hotels. The 28 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase of 9 million in cash paid for taxes, a decrease in interest received of 13 million due to a decrease in average cash balances and timing of receipts from our customers and payments to our vendors and other third parties. 
 Investing Activities 
 The 134 million in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to 164 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by 33 million of distributions from unconsolidated affiliates primarily related to the sale of the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. 
 The 91 million in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to 206 million in capital expenditures and land acquisitions, partially offset by 116 million of net proceeds from the sale of one of our hotels. 
 Financing Activities 
 The 447 million in net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the issuance of 550 million of 2030 Senior Notes and the 200 million 2024 Term Loan, offset by 656 million of debt repayments, 459 million of dividends paid and the repurchase of approximately 4.2 million shares of our common stock for 60 million. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 The 439 million in net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the repurchase of approximately 14.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately 180 million, 132 million of debt repayments and 120 million of dividends paid. 
 Dividends 
 As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Therefore, as a general matter, we intend to make distributions of all, or substantially all, of our REIT taxable income (including net capital gains) to our stockholders, and, as a result, we will generally not be required to pay tax on our income. Consequently, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs from our annual taxable income. Instead, we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts, if any, by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income. 
 We declared the following dividends to holders of our common stock during 2024: 
 Record Date Payment Date Dividend per Share March 29, 2024 April 15, 2024 0.25 June 28, 2024 July 15, 2024 0.25 September 30, 2024 October 15, 2024 0.25 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness was approximately 3.9 billion, including over 2 billion of our Senior Notes, and excluding both the 725 million SF Mortgage Loan (that we ceased making debt service payments in June 2023) and approximately 157 million of our share of debt from investments in affiliates. Substantially all the debt of such unconsolidated affiliates is secured solely by the affiliates assets or is guaranteed by other partners without recourse to us. Refer to Note 6: "Debt" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. We have discussed those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or the methods or assumptions we apply. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates, which may affect our future income, cash flows and fair value, depending on changes to interest rates. In certain situations, we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act )), as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were 
 30

 effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports filed or submitted with the Securities and Exchange Commission (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums, including proceedings involving tort and other general liability claims, employee claims and consumer protection claims. Most occurrences involving liability, claims of negligence and employees are covered by insurance with solvent insurance carriers. For those matters not covered by insurance, which include commercial matters, we recognize a liability when we believe the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. We believe we have adequate reserves against such matters. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and proceedings will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations in a particular period. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in response to Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 (3) On February 17, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized and approved a 300 million stock repurchase program, which expires on February 21, 2025. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 In June 2023, we ceased making debt service payments toward the SF Mortgage Loan, and we have received a notice of default from the servicer. As of October 30, 2024, the total arrearage related to the SF Mortgage Loan, including interest and fees was 84 million, of which 39 million is default interest. In October 2023, the trustee for the SF Mortgage Loan filed a lawsuit against the borrowers under the SF Mortgage Loan. In connection with the lawsuit, the court has appointed a receiver to take control of the Hilton San Francisco Hotels, which serve as security for the SF Mortgage Loan, and their operations, and thus, we have no further economic interest in the operations of the hotels. The receiver will operate and has authority over the hotels and, until no later than March 31, 2025, has the ability to sell the hotels. The lawsuit contemplates the receivership will end with a non-judicial foreclosure by July 15, 2025, if the hotels are not sold within the predetermined sale period.
