Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial position, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business.

 Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that we may not predict.

 and , respectively, and and for the quarter and three quarters ended September 24, 2023 , respectively . The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to the quarter and three quarters ended September 24, 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against a portion of the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the secondary offering in Q1 2024 and return to provision adjustments, partially offset by an increase in the Company's ownership interest in Portillo's OpCo, which increases its share of taxable income (loss) of Portillo's OpCo. The Company s annual effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21 primarily because the Company is not liable for federal or state income taxes on the portion of Portillo's OpCo s earnings that are attributable to non-controlling interests, deferred tax adjustments and impacts from equity-based award activity. 
 
 We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establish valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. As of September 29, 2024, the Company concluded, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, that all of its deferred tax assets (except for those deferred tax assets relating to the basis difference in its investment in Portillo's OpCo that will never be realizable or only reverse upon the eventual sale of its interest in Portillo's OpCo, which we expect would result in a capital loss which we do not expect to be able to utilize) are more likely than not to be realized.

Overview 
 
 Portillo s serves iconic Chicago street food through high-energy, multichannel restaurants designed to ignite the senses and create a memorable dining experience. Since our founding in 1963 in a small trailer which Dick Portillo called The Dog House, we have grown to become a treasured brand with a passionate (some might say obsessed) nationwide following. Our diverse menu features all-American favorites such as Chicago-style hot dogs and sausages, Italian beef sandwiches, char-broiled burgers, chopped salads, crinkle-cut fries, homemade chocolate cake and our signature chocolate cake shake. We create a consumer experience like no other by combining the best attributes of fast casual and quick service concepts with an exciting, energy-filled atmosphere and restaurant model capable of generating tremendous volumes. Nearly all of our restaurants were built with double lane drive-thrus and have been thoughtfully designed with a layout that accommodates a variety of access modes including dine-in, carryout, delivery, and catering in order to quickly and efficiently serve our guests. No matter how our guests order from us, our highly productive kitchens and team members consistently serve high quality food and deliver a memorable guest experience. We believe the combination of our craveable food, multichannel sales model, dedication to operational excellence, and distinctive culture driven by our team members gives us a competitive advantage. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, we owned and operated 88 Portillo s restaurants across ten states, including a restaurant owned by C O Chicago, L.L.C. ("C O") of which Portillo s owns 50 of the equity.

Recent Developments and Trends 
 
 In the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2024, total revenue grew 6.9 or 11.4 million and 6.9 or 33.9 million, respectively, primarily due to new restaurant openings in 2023 and 2024. Same-restaurant sales declined 0.9 during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, compared to 3.9 same-restaurant sales growth during the same quarter in 2023. Same-restaurant sales declined 0.9 during the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, compared to 6.1 same-restaurant sales growth during the three quarters ended September 24, 2023. Refer to "Selected Operating Data" section below for definition of Same-Restaurant Sales. 
 
 In the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2024, commodity inflation was 3.6 and 5.1 , respectively, compared to 3.5 and 5.8 for the quarter and three quarters ended September 24, 2023, respectively. Labor, as a percentage of revenue, net increased 0.3 and 0.2 during the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2024, respectively, compared to the quarter and three quarters ended September 24, 2023, primarily due to lower transactions and incremental wage rate increases, partially offset by an increase in our average check. For the full year 2024, we expect to achieve negative comparable sales of approximately 1.0 and restaurant-level margins between 23 and 24 . 
 
 In the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2024, total revenue, operating income, net income, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA all improved versus the prior year. We believe this improvement stemmed from maintaining concentration on our four strategic pillars, which guide our short-term objectives and form the basis for long-term growth: 
 
 Running world class operations : In the third quarter, we continued to focus on enhancing our guest experience. We redirected our general managers' efforts toward the key factors that drive transactions and sales growth, placing renewed emphasis on training our Team Members to improve speed and cultivate a sense of urgency. 
 
 Innovating and amplifying the Portillo's experience : In the third quarter, we introduced self-service kiosks at select locations, enhancing guest convenience and providing an additional ordering channel. We also re-launched our advertising in the Chicagoland market, consisting of TV commercials, billboards, and more. Our comprehensive advertising campaign coincided with the start of the NFL season. In late August, we also launched our first new cake flavor in 20 years: the Salted Caramel Spice Cake. 

Portillo's Inc. Form 10-Q | 22 

Building restaurants with industry leading returns : We continued our progress on our Restaurant of the Future concept, a 6,200 square foot prototype restaurant. We will have two Texas restaurants with this footprint by the end of 2024. 
 
 Taking great care of our teams : In the third quarter, we hosted our annual General Manager Summit to motivate, inspire, and celebrate our team members. 

Development Highlights 
 During the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, we opened four new restaurants. Subsequent to September 29, 2024, we opened one additional restaurant, bringing our total restaurant count to 89, as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including a restaurant owned by C O of which Portillo s owns 50 of the equity. We plan to open five more restaurants, all in December, for a total of 10 new restaurants opened in the fiscal year 2024, including further expansion into the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth markets in Texas.

 Revenues, Net 
 Revenues primarily represent the aggregate sales of food and beverages, net of discounts. Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues. Revenues in any period are directly influenced by, among other factors, the number of operating weeks in the period, the number of open restaurants, restaurant traffic, our menu prices, third-party delivery platform prices and product mix. 
 
 Revenues for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 were 178.3 million compared to 166.8 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, an increase of 11.4 million or 6.9 . The increase in revenues was primarily attributed to the opening of eight restaurants in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and four restaurants during the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in our same-restaurant sales. Restaurants not in our Comparable Restaurant Base contributed 13.6 million of the total year-over-year increase. This increase in revenues was offset by a same-restaurant sales decrease of 0.9 , or 1.4 million in the quarter. The same-restaurant sales decline was attributable to a 3.5 decrease in transactions, partially offset by an increase in average check of 2.6 . The higher average check was driven by an approximate 4.4 increase in certain menu prices partially offset by product mix. To address inflationary cost pressures, we increased select menu prices by approximately 1.5 in January 2024 and again at the end of March 2024. In June 2024, we implemented a 1 price increase primarily by re-tiering some of our restaurants in higher-cost areas. Revenue was negatively impacted by 1.0 million in the third quarter due to the shifting of comparable weeks. For the purpose of calculating same-restaurant sales for the quarter ended September 29, 2024, sales for 70 restaurants that were open for at least 24 full fiscal periods were included in the Comparable Restaurant Base (as defined in "Selected Operating Data" below).

 Revenues for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 were 525.9 million compared to 492.0 million for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023, an increase of 33.9 million or 6.9 . The increase in revenues was primarily attributed to the opening of twelve restaurants in 2023 and four restaurants during the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in our same-restaurant sales. Restaurants not in our Comparable Restaurant Base contributed 40.2 million of the total year-over-year increase. This increase in revenues was offset by a same-restaurant sales decrease of 0.9 , or 4.0 million. The same-restaurant sales decline was attributable to a 3.0 decrease in transactions, partially offset by an increase in average check of 2.1 . The higher average check was primarily driven by an approximate 4.6 increase in menu prices partially offset by product mix.

 Pre-opening expenses consist primarily of wages, occupancy expenses, which represent rent expense recognized during the period between the date of possession of the restaurant facility and the restaurant opening date, travel for the opening team and other supporting team members, food, beverage, and the initial stocking of operating supplies. All such costs incurred prior to the opening are expensed in the period in which the expense was incurred. Pre-opening expenses can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of openings and the specific pre-opening expenses incurred for each restaurant. Additionally, restaurant openings in new geographic market areas will experience higher pre-opening expenses than our established geographic market areas, such as the Chicagoland area, where we have greater economies of scale and incur lower travel and lodging costs for our training team. 
 
 Pre-opening expenses for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 were 1.7 million compared to 2.4 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, an decrease of 0.7 million or 27.5 .

 Net Income Attributable to Equity Method Investment 
 
 Net income attributable to equity method investment consists of a 50 interest in C O, which runs a single restaurant located within the Chicagoland market. We account for the investment and financial results in the condensed consolidated financial statements under the equity method of accounting as we have significant influence but do not have control. 
 
 Net income attributable to equity method investment was 0.4 million for both the quarter ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023. 
 
 Net income attributable to equity method investment for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 was 0.9 million compared to 1.0 million for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023, a decrease of 0.1 million or 8.6 . This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in restaurant-level operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in sales.

 Interest expense for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 was 6.5 million compared to 6.6 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, a decrease of 0.1 million or 1.9 . This decrease was primarily driven by a lower effective interest rate.

This decrease was primarily driven by a lower effective interest rate and the improved lending terms associated with our 2023 Term Loan and 2023 Revolver Facility. 
 
 Our effective interest rate on the 2023 Term Loan and 2023 Revolver Facility was 8.32 and 8.50 as of September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively.

 We are party to a Tax Receivable Agreement liability with certain members of PHD Group Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries ("Portillo's OpCo that provides for the payment by us of 85 of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that Portillo's Inc. actually realizes or in some cases is deemed to realize as a result of certain transactions. 
 
 The Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment was 1.7 million for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 and 2.7 million for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 related to a remeasurement primarily due to activity under equity-based compensation plans. The Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment was 0.5 million and 1.7 million for the quarter and three quarters ended September 24, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment

Loss on debt extinguishment for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023 was 3.5 million due to the write-off of debt discount and deferred issuance costs associated with the payoff of the 2014 Credit Agreement as described in Note 8. Debt. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Portillo's OpCo is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal, as well as state and local income tax purposes and is not subject to taxes. Rather, any taxable income or loss generated by Portillo's OpCo is allocated to its members in relation to their respective ownership percentage of Portillo's OpCo. We are subject to U.S. federal, as well as state and local, income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Portillo's OpCo, as well as any stand-alone income or loss generated by Portillo's Inc. 
 
 Income tax expense for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 was 2.5 million compared to 2.6 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, a decrease of 0.1 million or 3.2 . Our effective income tax rate for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 was 22.4 , compared to 28.6 for the quarter ended September 24, 2023. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 24, 2023 was primarily driven by return to provision adjustments, partially offset by an increase in the company's ownership interest in Portillo's OpCo, which increases its share of taxable income (loss) of Portillo's OpCo. 
 
 Income tax expense for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 was 4.9 million compared to income tax expense of 3.6 million for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023, an increase of 1.3 million or 35.9 . Our effective income tax rate for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 was 17.8 , compared to 19.2 for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to the three quarters ended September 24, 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against a portion of the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the secondary offering in Q1 2024 and return to provision adjustments, partially offset by an increase in the Company's ownership interest in Portillo's OpCo, which increases its share of taxable income (loss) of Portillo's OpCo. 
 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
 
 We are the sole managing member of Portillo's OpCo. We manage and operate the business and control the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Portillo s OpCo and we also have a substantial financial interest in Portillo s OpCo. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of Portillo s OpCo, and a portion of our net income is allocated to non-controlling interests to reflect the entitlement of the pre-IPO LLC Members who retained their equity ownership in Portillo's OpCo (the "pre-IPO LLC Members"). The weighted average ownership percentages for the applicable reporting periods are used to attribute net income (loss) to Portillo's Inc. and the non-controlling interest holders. 
 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 was 1.6 million, compared to net income attributable to non-controlling interests of 2.2 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, a decrease of 0.6 million or 28.9 . The decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the non-controlling interest holders' weighted average ownership from 24.1 for the quarter ended September 24, 2023 to 15.8 for the quarter ended September 29, 2024, partially offset by an increase in net income for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 24, 2023. 
 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 was 4.4 million, compared to net income attributable to non-controlling interest of 4.5 million for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023, a decrease of 0.1 million or 3.1 . The

 decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the non-controlling interest holders' weighted average ownership, from 26.6 for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023 to 17.7 for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, partially offset by an increase in net income for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to the three quarters ended September 24, 2023. 

Selected Operating Data and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to the GAAP measures presented in our financial statements, we use the following selected operating data and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts and make strategic decisions. These key measures include restaurant openings, average unit volume ("AUV"), same-restaurant sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Company includes these measures because management believes that they are important to day-to-day operations and overall strategy and are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.

AUVs for the quarters ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 represent AUVs for the twelve months ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively. Total restaurants indicated are as of September 29, 2024. 
 (b) Excludes a restaurant that is owned by C O of which Portillo s owns 50 of the equity. 
 (c) For the quarter ended September 29, 2024, same-restaurant sales compares the 13 weeks from July 1, 2024 through September 29, 2024 to the 13 weeks from July 3, 2023 through October 1, 2023. For the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, same-restaurant sales compares the 39 weeks from January 1, 2024 through September 29, 2024 to the 39 weeks from January 2, 2023 through October 1, 2023. 
 
 Change in Same-Restaurant Sales 
 
 The change in same-restaurant sales is the percentage change in year-over-year revenue (excluding gift card breakage) for the comparable restaurant base, which is defined as the number of restaurants open for at least 24 full fiscal periods (the Comparable Restaurant Base ). For the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, there were 70 and 66 restaurants in our Comparable Restaurant Base, respectively. The Comparable Restaurant Base excludes a restaurant that is owned by C O, of which Portillo s owns 50 of the equity. 
 
 A change in same-restaurant sales is the result of a change in restaurant transactions, average guest check, or a combination of the two. We gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the guest transaction counts and the mix of menu items sold to strategically evaluate menu pricing and demand. Measuring our change in same-restaurant sales allows management to evaluate the performance of our existing restaurant base. We believe this measure provides a consistent comparison of restaurant sales results and trends across periods within our core, established restaurant base, unaffected by results of restaurant openings and enables investors to better understand and evaluate the Company s historical and prospective operating performance. 
 
 Average Unit Volume ("AUV") 
 
 AUV is the total revenue (excluding gift card breakage) recognized in the Comparable Restaurant Base, including C O, divided by the number of restaurants in the Comparable Restaurant Base, including C O, by period. 
 
 This key performance indicator allows management to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Accordingly, these measures are not required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP, but rather are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants. You should be aware that these measures are not indicative of overall results for the Company and that Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders because of corporate-level expenses excluded from such measures. These measures are supplemental measures of operating performance and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. These measures are important measures to evaluate the performance and profitability of our restaurants, individually and in the aggregate, but also have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income taxes, adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing core operating performance as identified in the reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, net. 
 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (i) to evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategies, (ii) internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors and (iii) as factors in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation. 
 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are important measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to our core operating performance.

Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA excludes corporate level expenses and depreciation and amortization on restaurant property and equipment. Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, net. 
 
 We believe that Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin are important measures to evaluate the performance and profitability of our restaurants, individually and in the aggregate.

 (1) Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues, net. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and availability under our 2023 Revolver Facility. As of September 29, 2024, we maintained a cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of 18.5 million and had 80.7 million of availability under our 2023 Revolver Facility, after giving effect to 5.3 million in outstanding letters of credit. 
 
 Our primary requirements for liquidity are to fund our working capital needs, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, and general restaurant support center needs. Our requirements for working capital are not significant because our guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or on debit or credit cards at the time of the sale and we are able to sell many of our inventory items before payment is due to the supplier of such items. Our ongoing capital expenditures are principally related to opening of new restaurants, existing capital investments (both for remodels and maintenance), as well as investments in our restaurant support center infrastructure. 
 
 Based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, we expect that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months, and the foreseeable future. 
 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 
 In connection with the IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement ("TRA") with certain of our pre-IPO LLC Members, pursuant to which we will generally be required to pay 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local income tax that we actually realize or are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) our allocable share of existing tax basis in depreciable or amortizable assets relating to LLC Units acquired in the IPO, (ii) certain favorable tax attributes acquired by the Company from entities treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes that held LLC Units prior to the Transactions ("Blocker Companies") (including net operating losses and the Blocker Companies' allocable share of existing tax basis), (iii) increases in our allocable share of then existing tax basis in depreciable or amortizable assets, and adjustments to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets, of Portillo s OpCo and its subsidiaries, as a result of (x) sales or exchanges of interests in Portillo s OpCo (including the repayment of the redeemable preferred units) in connection with the IPO and (y) future redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units by pre-IPO LLC Members for Class A common stock and (iv) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including payments made under the TRA. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, we estimate that our obligation for future payments under the TRA totaled 326.7 million. Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the TRA and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the TRA to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related TRA payments. The payments that we are required to make will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize to fund the required payments. Assuming no material changes in relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the TRA, we estimate that the tax savings associated with all tax attributes described above would aggregate to approximately 384.3 million as of September 29, 2024. Under this scenario, we would be required to pay the TRA Parties approximately 85 of such amount, or 326.7 million, primarily over the next 15 years, substantially declining in year 16 through year 47. In the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 and 
 
 Portillo's Inc. Form 10-Q | 33 

Table of Contents 

 September 24, 2023, we made TRA payments of 4.4 million relating to tax year 2022 and 0.8 million relating to tax year 2021, respectively. We expect a payment of 7.7 million relating to tax year 2023 to be paid within the next 12 months. 

Summary of Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands): Three Quarters Ended September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 71,954 53,570 Net cash used in investing activities (56,437) (57,579) Net cash used in financing activities 
 (7,435) (27,471) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 8,082 (31,480) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 10,438 44,427 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 18,520 12,947 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 was 72.0 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 53.6 million for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023, an increase of 18.4 million or 34.3 . This increase was primarily driven by the change in operating assets and liabilities of 14.6 million and an increase in net income of 7.5 million, partially offset by the change in non-cash items of 3.7 million. 
 
 The 14.6 million change in our operating assets and liabilities balances was primarily driven by operating assets and liabilities being a source of net cash of 17.1 million in the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, compared to a source of net cash of 2.6 million in three quarters ended September 24, 2023 driven by the change in accounts payable, deferred lease incentives, other current assets, and accounts receivable in the three quarters ended September 29, 2024. The increase in net income for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to the factors driving the aforementioned change in revenues and expenses as described in the condensed consolidated results of operations in the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to the three quarters ended September 24, 2023. The 3.7 million change from the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 in non-cash charges is primarily driven by the loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year, lower equity-based compensation expense, and lower income tax expense, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization in the current year. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 56.4 million for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to 57.6 million for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023, a decrease of 1.1 million or 2.0 . This decrease was primarily due to adopting a more cost effective restaurant format, number and timing of restaurant openings, and buildings in process during the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to the three quarters ended September 24, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 7.4 million for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 27.5 million for the three quarters ended September 24, 2023, a decrease of 20.0 million or 72.9 . This decrease is primarily due to the payment and borrowing of long-term debt in connection with our refinancing during the three quarters ended September 24, 2023, as described in Note 8. Debt. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in payments related to the Tax Receivable Agreement liability of 3.6 million for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the three quarters ended September 24, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Information regarding certain legal proceedings to which the Company is a party are discussed in Note 13. Contingencies in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as updated in the Company's last Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and as set forth below. 
 
 Matters relating to employment and labor law could have a material adverse effect, result in litigation or union activities, add significant costs and divert management attention. 
 
 Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationships with our team members and affect our operating costs, including the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which governs worker health and safety, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages and overtime, and a variety of federal, state and local laws that govern employment law matters like employee classifications, unemployment tax rates, workers compensation rates, family leave, working conditions, safety standards, immigration status, payroll taxes, discrimination, and citizenship requirements. In addition, under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA ), we must provide affordable coverage, as defined in ACA, to eligible team members, or make a payment per team member based on ACA's affordability criteria. Additionally, some state and local laws mandate certain levels of health benefits by some employers. Significant additional government regulations and new laws, including mandated increases in minimum wages, changes in exempt and non-exempt status, paid leave, or increased mandated benefits such as health care and insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in federal or state workplace regulations could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial targets. 
 
 Federal law requires that we verify that our team members have the proper documentation and authorization to work in the U.S. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our team members may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the E-Verify program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government to verify employment eligibility, in Arizona and Florida, which are the only states in which we operate where participation is required. However, use of the E-Verify program does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and we may be subject to fines or penalties if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized. Termination of a significant number of team members who lack work authorization may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new team members and result in adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. As a result of such events, we could experience adverse publicity that may negatively impact our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified team members. These factors could materially adversely affect our our business, financial condition and results of operations (collectively, "our Results"). 
 
 Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by team members, consumers, suppliers, shareholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. In recent years, restaurant companies, including us, have been subject to lawsuits, including class actions, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment conditions, discrimination and similar matters. Some lawsuits have resulted in substantial damage awards. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, overtime eligibility of managers and failure to pay for all hours worked. Whether or not claims against us are valid or whether we are found liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and result in increases in our insurance premiums. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce guest traffic and sales. Although we believe we maintain adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover all potential liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could have a material adverse effect on our Results. 
 
 Portillo's Inc. Form 10-Q | 37 

Certain of our team members at our commissaries in Addison, IL and Aurora, IL voted on April 13, 2023 and April 30, 2024, respectively, in favor of being represented by a union. We filed objections to the 2023 election with the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB") on April 19, 2023, asserting that the promises made by the union and its agent prevented a free and fair election. We have appealed to the NLRB to set aside the election results. We filed an objection to the 2024 election with the NLRB on May 7, 2024, asserting that the promises made by the union and its agents prevented a free and fair election. Although we have not received other petitions to unionize, it is possible that additional team members may seek to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a significant number of our team members were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could have a material adverse effect on our Results. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all our team members may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of labor disputes could increase our costs. Further, if we enter into a new market with unionized construction companies, or the construction companies in our current markets become unionized, construction and build-out costs for new restaurants in such markets could materially increase. 
 
 Security breaches, system interruptions, material failure of our system, or complications with the implementation or usage of our new enterprise resource planning system could disrupt our operations, compromise confidential personally identifying information, subject us to loss, harm our business, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our information technology systems, which in some cases rely on third-party providers, have in the past, and may in the future experience service interruptions, degradation or other performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism perpetrated by criminal third parties, third parties we do business with, or team members. Our reliance on third parties increases our exposure to such risks as we exercise less control over such persons. 
 
 While we endeavor to keep all systems current, there can be no guarantee that we can update and maintain our systems at all times. In instances where we are unable to do so, our risk mitigation efforts may fail. Any such failure could lead to website downtime, disruptions to our information technology systems, or malicious behavior by threat actors. In Q2 2024, we completed the implementation of our new ERP system, designed to accurately maintain the Company s financial records, enhance operational functionality, and provide timely information to the Company s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of personnel and financial resources as we support post-implementation efforts and system functionality. These post-implementation efforts could result in delays, increased costs, and other difficulties, and disruptions or difficulties in using our ERP system could result in harm to our business. Additionally, if the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to adequately assess those controls could be further delayed. 
 
 Our business requires the collection, transmission, and retention of large volumes of guest and team member data, including personally identifiable information, through information technology systems maintained by us or vendors retained by us. In particular, our omni-channel approach relies in large part on our information technology systems to operate successfully and allow for capabilities like mobile order and pay, third-party delivery, and digital menu boards. Like many other companies, we have experienced, and will continue to experience, attempts to compromise our information technology systems. As we expand our business channels, our risk exposure will increase proportionately. The techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks have occurred. While we continue to make significant investment in physical and technological security measures, team member training, and third-party services to anticipate cyberattacks and prevent breaches, protect our information technology networks and infrastructure, and to identify vendors and service providers that could be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, shutdowns, data loss, or breaches due to criminal conduct, team member error, negligence or malfeasance, utility failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing every possible instance of cyberattacks, breach, or data loss, any of which could disrupt our operations, resulting in inefficiencies and a loss of profits. 
 
 Additionally, the cybersecurity and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulations are evolving. Our systems may not be able to immediately satisfy applicable requirements, and may require significant additional investment and time to do so. A significant theft, loss or misappropriation of, or unauthorized access to, our guests data or other proprietary data could result in fines, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, which could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to claims from guests and team members, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our Results. Our cyber insurance and business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses that may result from a cybersecurity incident. As a result, if we experience any outsized material impacts from a failure of our systems, our Results could be materially

and adversely affected. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could be adversely affected, which could impair our ability to attract and retain guests and qualified employees.
