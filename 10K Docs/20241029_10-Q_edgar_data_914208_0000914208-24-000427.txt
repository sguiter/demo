 Change in Accounting Estimate 
 
 In September 2024, the company made changes to the retirement criteria for vesting of currently outstanding common share-based awards and other long-term awards (collectively, long-term awards) which resulted in a change in estimate for long-term awards granted to employees who meet the criteria. The change to the criteria became effective during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and resulted in the accelerated recognition of million in Employee compensation expense.

 Total Return Swap (TRS) 
 
 In addition to holding equity investments, the company has a TRS to hedge economically certain deferred compensation liabilities.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, market valuation gains related to the TRS were million and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 gains related to the TRS were million (three and nine months ended September 30, 2023: million net losses and million net gains). 
 
 The fair value of the TRS was determined under the market approach using quoted prices of the underlying investments and, as such, is classified as level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The TRS is not designated for hedge accounting.

million and under the guarantees is million. The fair value of the guarantee liability is not significant to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into agreements with financial institutions to guarantee certain obligations of other company subsidiaries. The company would be required to perform under these guarantees in the event of certain defaults. The company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
 
 Legal Contingencies 
 
 The company is from time to time involved in pending or threatened litigation relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. The nature and progression of litigation can make it difficult to predict the impact a particular lawsuit or claim will have on the company. There are many reasons that the company cannot make these assessments, including, among others, one or more of the following: the proceeding is in its early stages (or merely threatened); the damages sought are unspecified, unsupportable, unexplained or uncertain; the claimant is seeking relief other than compensatory damages; the matter presents novel legal claims or other meaningful legal uncertainties; discovery has not started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; and there are other parties who may share in any ultimate liability. 
 
 The company and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various regulatory inquiries, reviews and investigations and legal proceedings, including civil litigation, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions. These actions can arise from normal business operations and/or matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews. As a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country, at any given time, our business operations may be subject to review, investigation, or disciplinary action. 
 
 In assessing the impact that a legal or regulatory matter will have on the company, management evaluates the need for an accrual on a case-by-case basis. If the likelihood of a loss is deemed probable and is reasonably estimable, the estimated loss is accrued. If the likelihood of a loss is assessed as less than probable, a loss is not accrued. If a loss is deemed probable but an amount or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, a loss is not accrued but the matter is disclosed. 
 
 The company accrued a million liability in the second quarter in connection with a previously disclosed investigation by the SEC into compliance with electronic business communications recordkeeping requirements, which was resolved during the third quarter, and a separate regulatory matter, neither of which is expected to have a material impact on the company. 
 
 In management s opinion, adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2024 to provide for any losses that may arise from matters for which the company could reasonably estimate an amount and are deemed probable. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of claims or regulatory matters will not materially affect the company s business, revenue, net income or liquidity.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this Report. Except for the historical financial information, this Report may include statements that constitute forward-looking statements under the U.S. securities laws. Forward-looking statements include information concerning future results of our operations, expenses, earnings, liquidity, cash flow, capital expenditures, and AUM which could differ materially from actual results due to known and unknown risks and other important factors, including, but not limited to, industry or market conditions, geopolitical events and pandemics or health crises and their respective potential impact on the company, acquisitions and divestitures, debt and our ability to obtain additional financing or make payments, regulatory developments, demand for and pricing of our products, the prospects for certain legal contingencies, and other aspects of our business or general economic conditions. In addition, when used in this Report or such other documents or statements, words such as believes, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, projects, forecasts, and future or conditional verbs such as will, may, could, should, and would as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. None of this information should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, historical financial statements. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge them to carefully consider the risks described in this Report and our most recent Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q filed with the SEC.

 Executive Overview 
 
 The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management s discussion and analysis and supplements should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. 
 
 The company is an independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering a superior investment experience. Our comprehensive range of active, passive and alternative investment capabilities has been constructed over many years to help clients achieve their investment objectives. We draw on this comprehensive range of capabilities to provide solutions designed to deliver key outcomes aligned to client needs. One of Invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our diversification across investment capabilities, distribution channels and geographies. This broad diversification helps to mitigate some of the impact of different market cycles on Invesco and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels.

 We had 16.5 billion of net long-term inflows for the quarter, primarily driven by Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Index, Fundamental Fixed Income, and Multi-Asset/Other, driving total AUM to a record 1.8 trillion, an increase of 4.7 from the prior quarter. 
 
 We remain highly focused on our capital priorities, investing in our key capabilities, efficiently allocating resources, and simplifying and streamlining the organization to better position the company for greater scale, performance and improved profitability. We are delivering on our commitment to improve our leverage profile and maintain a strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of over 1 billion and a zero balance on our credit agreement. We believe the progress we have made to build financial flexibility has Invesco well-positioned to navigate various market conditions and deliver long-term growth. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2024, the company repurchased 1.5 million common shares for 25.0 million in the open market, and we plan to continue common share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 

Presentation of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of Consolidated Investment Products 
 
 The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, investment products sponsored by the company in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this Report as CIP. The company s economic risk with respect to each investment in CIP is limited to its equity ownership, unfunded equity commitments and any uncollected management and performance fees. See also Note 11, "Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information regarding the impact of the consolidation of managed funds. 
 
 The majority of the company s CIP balances are related to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company s direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider these assets to be company assets. Likewise, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. 
 
 Due to the significant impact that CIP has on the presentation of the company s Consolidated Financial Statements, the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-GAAP disclosures (among other adjustments). See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information" for additional information regarding these adjustments. The following discussion therefore combines the results presented under U.S. GAAP with the company s non-GAAP presentation.

 Investment Capabilities Performance Overview 
 
 Invesco's first strategic objective is a commitment to deliver the excellence our clients expect, which includes strong investment performance over the long-term for our clients. The table below presents investment performance of our actively managed investment products measured by the percentage of our AUM in the first and second quartile compared to our peers and above benchmark for the investment capabilities for which peer and benchmark data are available.

 (1) Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary funds, unit investment trusts (UITs), fund of funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds and collateralized debt obligations. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. 
 AUM measured in the one, three and five year quartile rankings represents 39 , 38 and 38 of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one, three and five year basis represents 50 , 49 , and 46 of total Invesco AUM as of 9/30/2024. Peer group ranking are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund s market (Morningstar, IA, Lipper, eVestment, Mercer, Galaxy, SITCA, Value Research) and asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and prior month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings are calculated against all funds in each peer group. Rankings for the primary share class of the most representative fund in each composite are applied to all products within each composite. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor s experience.

 Assets Under Management 
 
 The following presentation and discussion of AUM includes Passive and Active AUM. Passive AUM includes index-based ETFs, UITs, non-management fee earning AUM and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM. 
 
 Non-management fee earning AUM includes non-management fee earning ETFs, UITs and product leverage. The net flows in non-management fee earning AUM can be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield. 
 
 The AUM tables and the discussion below refer to certain AUM as long-term. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds. Long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital upon maturity. We present net flows into money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and the flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. 
 
 Changes in AUM by investment approach were as follows:

 (1) U.S. GAAP Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to U.S. GAAP annualized total Operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (Invesco Great Wall or IGW) AUM. The average AUM for IGW in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 90.0 billion and 87.0 billion (three and nine months ended September 30, 2023: 86.1 billion and 88.9 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of IGW as the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. The U.S. GAAP Gross revenue yield is not a good measure because the numerator excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Net revenue yield metrics include the Net revenues and Average AUM of IGW and CIP. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of Operating revenues to Net revenues. 
 (2) Performance fees are earned when certain performance metrics are achieved and QQQ ETFs do not earn net revenues. Therefore, net revenue yield is calculated excluding performance fees and QQQ AUM. Passive net revenue yield is calculated excluding QQQ AUM.

 Flows 
 
 There are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investments, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients, and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor s decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows. 
 
 Market Returns 
 
 Market gains and losses include the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period. The table in the Executive Overview section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis summarizes returns based on price appreciation/(depreciation) of several major market indices for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Rates 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced an increase in AUM of 16.3 billion and 4.2 billion, respectively, due to changes in foreign exchange rates. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, AUM decreased by 6.5 billion and 11.4 billion, respectively, due to foreign exchange rate changes.

 (1) Total Revenue Adjustments remove pass through investment management fees, service and distribution fees, and other revenues and equal the same amount as the Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses. 
 (2) See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. 
 
 Our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net inflows (or outflows), and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. See the company s disclosures regarding the changes in AUM during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information. 
 
 Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than Active AUM, and therefore, changes in the mix of AUM between Active and Passive have an impact on revenues and net revenue yield. Average AUM were 1,742.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,528.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The impact of the increase in AUM on our revenues was partially offset by the shift in AUM toward lower yield passive products, such as ETFs. As a result, net revenue yield excluding performance fees and QQQ declined to 30.3 basis points (bps) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 32.9 bps for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Average AUM were 1,674.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,495.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impact of the increase in AUM on our revenues was partially offset by the shift in AUM toward lower yield passive products, such as ETFs. As a result, net revenue yield excluding performance fees and QQQ declined to 30.4 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 32.7 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In addition, as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to the mix of AUM between geographies and exchange rates have an impact on revenues and net revenue yields.

 Investment Management Fees 
 
 Investment management fees were 1,100.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,041.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of higher average AUM partially offset by the shift in AUM toward lower yield products. See discussion above on how AUM changes impact our Investment management fees. 
 
 Investment management fees were 3,215.0 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3,102.7 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of higher average AUM partially offset by the shift in AUM toward lower yield products. See discussion above on how AUM changes impact our Investment management fees. 
 
 Service and Distribution Fees 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, Service and distribution fees were 360.3 million as compared to 353.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher distribution fees resulting from higher AUM to which the fees apply. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Service and distribution fees were 1,098.9 million as compared to 1,030.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher distribution fees of 58.2 million resulting from higher AUM to which the fees apply and administrative fees of 9.2 million primarily resulting from higher fund-related service fees. 
 
 Performance Fees 
 
 Performance fees were 2.8 million and 12.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and were primarily generated from private markets products. 
 
 Performance fees were 2.0 million and 27.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and were primarily generated from private markets products. 
 
 Other Revenues 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, Other revenues were 51.8 million as compared to 45.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Other revenues was primarily driven by higher transaction fees. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other revenues were 147.8 million as compared to 143.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Other revenues was primarily driven by higher transaction fees. 
 
 Invesco Great Wall 
 
 The company s most significant joint venture is our investment in IGW. The company reflects 100 of IGW's results in its Net revenues and Adjusted operating expenses because it is important to evaluate the contribution that IGW is making to the business. The company s non-GAAP operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying AUM and flows. Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of Net revenues. 
 
 Net revenues from IGW were 76.9 million and average AUM was 90.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Net revenues were 90.7 million and average AUM was 86.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023). The decrease in IGW revenues was primarily driven by the shift in AUM toward lower yield products. 
 
 Net revenues from IGW were 237.7 million and average AUM was 87.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Net revenues were 288.8 million and average AUM was 88.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023). The decrease in IGW revenues was primarily driven by the regulatory mandated fee reductions in China and the shift in AUM toward lower yield products.

 Management, performance and other fees earned from CIP 
 
 Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust Operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating Net revenues. As Management and Performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these Operating revenues back in the calculation of Net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of Net revenues. 
 
 Management and Performance fees earned from CIP were 11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (three months ended September 30, 2023: 13.7 million). 
 
 Management and Performance fees earned from CIP were 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 38.8 million).

 Transaction, Integration and Restructuring 
 
 Transaction, integration and restructuring charges incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily comprised of compensation-related restructuring costs relating to our strategic evaluation which we completed in the first quarter of 2023. With the completion of strategic initiatives, any costs related to on-going projects are classified in the income statement based on the nature of the expense. 
 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 
 The main categories of Other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows: 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, Variance September 30, Variance (in millions) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 2.1 16.9 (14.8) (87.6) 22.9 62.2 (39.3) (63.2) Interest and dividend income 10.9 10.8 0.1 0.9 34.3 26.5 7.8 29.4 Interest expense (13.4) (17.3) 3.9 (22.5) (45.6) (53.7) 8.1 (15.1) Other gains/(losses), net 28.3 (23.3) 51.6 N/A 67.8 25.0 42.8 171.2 Other income/(expense) of CIP, net 16.7 15.2 1.5 9.9 88.1 (5.4) 93.5 N/A Total other income and expenses 44.6 2.3 42.3 1,839.1 167.5 54.6 112.9 206.8 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 16.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by losses on our private markets investments and lower earnings from our joint venture investment in IGW as discussed above. 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased to 22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 62.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower earnings from our joint venture investment in IGW as discussed above and losses on our private markets investments. 
 
 Interest and dividend income 
 
 Interest and dividend income was 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest and dividend income was 34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 26.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned from Cash and cash equivalents and higher dividend income earned on our private markets investments. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense was 13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the decrease in outstanding debt. 
 
 Interest expense was 45.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 53.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the decrease in outstanding debt. 
 
 Other gains/(losses), net 
 
 Other gains/(losses), net was a net gain of 28.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of 23.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included net market gains on deferred compensation related investments, other hedging instruments, and seed capital investments.

Table of Contents 

 Other gains/(losses), net was a net gain of 67.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net gain of 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included net market gains on deferred compensation related investments, other hedging instruments, and seed capital investments. 
 
 Other income/(expense) of CIP, net 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Other income/(expense) of CIP, net was net income of 16.7 million (three months ended September 30, 2023: net income of 15.2 million). Interest and dividend income of CIP decreased 36.3 million to 144.9 million (three months ended September 30, 2023: 181.2 million). Interest expense of CIP decreased 0.1 million to 118.0 million (three months ended September 30, 2023: 118.1 million). Unrealized gains/(losses) of CIP were net losses of 10.2 million (three months ended September 30, 2023: net losses of 47.9 million). 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other income/(expense) of CIP, net was net income of 88.1 million (nine months ended September 30, 2023: net expense of 5.4 million). Interest and dividend income of CIP decreased 89.3 million to 395.2 million (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 484.5 million). Interest expense of CIP decreased 37.2 million to 284.9 million (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 322.1 million). Unrealized gains/(losses) of CIP were net losses of 22.2 million (nine months ended September 30, 2023: net losses of 167.8 million). 
 
 Net impact of CIP and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 
 
 The adjustment to Net income for the Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities removes the income/(expense) of CIP which is attributable to third-party investors. Therefore, the consolidation of investment products did not have an impact on Net income attributable to Invesco for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Also, the net income or loss of CIP is taxed at the investor level, not at the product level; therefore, a tax provision is not reflected in the net impact of CIP. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 The company s subsidiaries operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory tax rate. As a result, the blended statutory tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses from each jurisdiction. 
 
 Our effective tax rate increased to 28.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (three months ended September 30, 2023: 26.7 ). The increase in the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible executive compensation related to the one-time acceleration of compensation expense for long-term awards. 
 
 Our effective tax rate decreased to 25.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 28.3 ). The decrease in the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities.

 Schedule of Non-GAAP Information 
 
 We utilize the following non-GAAP performance measures: Net revenues (and by calculation, Net revenue yield on AUM), Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco and Adjusted diluted EPS. The company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company s ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors. These measures also assist the company s management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are Operating revenues (and by calculation, Gross revenue yield on AUM), Operating income, Operating margin, Net income attributable to Invesco and diluted EPS. Each of these measures is discussed more fully below. 
 
 The following are reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to the non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. The tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. Notes to the reconciliations follow the tables.

 (1) Revenue adjustments: The company calculates Net revenues by reducing Operating revenues to exclude fees that are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company s managed funds. The Net revenue presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the company, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco s own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates Net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to Net revenues divided by Average AUM during the reporting period, as an indicator of the Net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage. 
 Investment management fees are adjusted by renewal commissions and certain administrative fees. Service and distribution fees are primarily adjusted by distribution fees passed through to broker dealers for certain share classes and pass through fund-related costs. Other revenues are primarily adjusted by transaction fees passed through to third parties. 
 (2) Invesco Great Wall: The company reflects 100 of IGW in its Net revenues and Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin . The company s non-GAAP operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying AUM and flows. Adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. 
 (3) CIP: See note 11, Consolidated Investment Products, for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of CIP. The company believes that the CIP may impact a reader s analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust Operating revenues and Operating income for the impact of CIP in calculating the respective Net revenues and Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin). 
 (4) Transaction, integration and restructuring: The company believes it is useful to adjust for the Transaction, integration and restructuring charges in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and restructuring related charges. Transaction, integration and restructuring charges were restructuring costs relating to our strategic evaluation which we completed in the first quarter of 2023. 
 (5) Amortization of intangible assets: The company removes amortization expense related to acquired assets in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition-related charges. 
 (6) Market valuation changes related to deferred compensation plan liabilities: Certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments. The company economically hedges the exposure to market movements on these deferred compensation liabilities. Since these plans are economically hedged, the company believes it is useful to remove the market movements related to the deferred compensation plan liabilities from the calculation of Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin) and to remove the net impact of the economic hedge from the calculation of Adjusted net income (and by calculation, Adjusted diluted EPS) to produce results that will be more comparable period to period.

 (7) One-time acceleration of compensation expense for currently outstanding long-term awards: In the third quarter of 2024, the company recorded a one-time acceleration of Compensation expense of 147.6 million resulting from changes to the retirement criteria for vesting of currently outstanding long-term awards. Due to the non-recurring nature of this item, the company removed this expense in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS as this will aid comparability of our results period to period. 
 (8) General and administrative: In the second quarter of 2024, the company recorded a 50.0 million liability related to regulatory matters. Due to the non-recurring nature of these items, the company removed the expense in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS as this will aid comparability of our results period to period. The adjustment in 2023 removed insurance recoveries related to fund-related losses incurred in prior periods. 
 (9) Operating margin is equal to Operating income divided by Operating revenues. 
 (10) Adjusted operating margin is equal to Adjusted operating income divided by Net revenues. 
 (11) Tax adjustment for amortization of intangible assets and goodwill: The company reflects the tax benefit realized on the tax amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in Adjusted net income. The company believes it is useful to include this tax benefit in arriving at the Adjusted diluted EPS measure. 
 (12) Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted common shares outstanding.

 Investments 
 
 Investments are comprised primarily of the equity method investment in IGW, seed capital and co-investments in affiliated funds, and investments related to the company s deferred compensation plans. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 the company had 1,011.2 million and 956.0 million in seed capital and co-investments, respectively, including direct investments in CIP. Total seed capital and co-investments is presented as a helpful measure for investors and represents our total net investment interest including our investment in CIP. The following table reconciles the investments balance to the total seed capital and co-investment balance.

 (1) Included in the total seed capital and co-investments balance as of September 30, 2024 is 299.7 million of seed capital and 711.5 million of co-investments (December 31, 2023: 314.1 million of seed capital and 641.9 million of co-investments). 
 
 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 
 
 Goodwill and intangible assets, net increased from 14,539.6 million at December 31, 2023, to 14,547.1 million at September 30, 2024. The increase includes foreign exchange impacts of 41.4 million offset by amortization of 33.9 million. If our revenue and operating income are adversely impacted by our AUM mix or unfavorable market conditions, including a significant decline in our stock price for an extended period of time, an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets may occur in future periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit agreement and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating expenses, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements.

 Capital Management 
 
 Our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include, in no particular order of priority: reinvestment in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the company repurchased 1.5 million common shares for 25.0 million in the open market. 
 
 Our capital process is executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain strong, investment grade credit ratings. As of the date of our filing, Invesco held credit ratings of BBB+/Stable, A3/Stable and A/Stable from Standard Poor s (S P) Ratings Service, Moody s Investor Services and Fitch Ratings, respectively.

 Other Items 
 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital, liquidity, and working capital. Such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance, and review from regulators. These and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. Our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us. 
 
 We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the company s minimum regulatory capital requirement was 349.1 million (December 31, 2023: 395.8 million). 
 
 We meet the regulatory liquidity and working capital requirements by holding cash and cash equivalents in the European sub-group. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group in the countries where it is located. Due to the liquidity and working capital requirements, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. 
 
 The consolidation of 8,606.6 million of assets and 6,562.6 million of debt of CIP as of September 30, 2024, respectively, did not impact the company s liquidity and capital resources. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 11, Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. 

Cash Flows Discussion 
 
 The following table represents a reconciliation of the cash flow information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis to the cash flows information excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIP for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the table: 
 
 Cash flows information (1)

 (1) These tables include non-GAAP presentations. Cash held by CIP is not available for use by Invesco. Additionally, there is no recourse to Invesco for CIP debt. The cash flows of CIP do not form part of the company s cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Operating cash flows include the receipt of Investment management and other fees generated from AUM, offset by Operating expenses and Changes in operating assets and liabilities. After allowing for the change in cash held by CIP, investment activities, non-cash activity, and seasonal payments such as bonus payments in the first quarter, our operating cash flows generally move in the same direction as our Operating income. 
 
 Cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding the impact of the consolidation of CIP, was partially driven by net inflows from changes in payables and receivables due to timing of payments and receipts.

 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding the impact of the consolidation of CIP, included Purchase of investments of 149.5 million (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 118.0 million purchases), partially offset by proceeds of 129.8 million from Capital distributions from equity method investees (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 19.4 million; this period also included proceeds of 50.8 million from the Sale of investments). In addition, the company had capital expenditures of 76.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 124.0 million). Our capital expenditures related principally to investments in foundational technology projects. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Financing cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding the impact of the consolidation of CIP, included 278.7 million of common dividend payments for the dividends declared in January, April and July (nine months ended September 30, 2023: common dividends paid of 267.7 million), 177.6 million of preferred dividend payments for dividends declared in January, April and July (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 177.6 million) and the payment of 28.3 million to meet employees withholding tax obligations on common share vestings (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 33.1 million). The nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included a 600.0 million redemption of our senior notes (nine months ended September 30, 2023: none). Financing cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included purchases of common shares through the open market of 25.0 million (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 150.0 million). 

Dividends 
 
 When declared, Invesco pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. Holders of our preferred shares are eligible to receive dividends at an annual rate of 5.9 of the liquidation preference of 1,000 per share, or 59 per share per annum. The preferred stock dividend is payable quarterly on a non-cumulative basis when, if and as declared by our Board of Directors. However, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for a particular dividend period, we may not declare or pay dividends on, redeem, purchase or acquire, our common stock or other junior securities in the next succeeding dividend period. In addition, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for six quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors of the company will be increased by two and the holders of the preferred shares shall have the right to elect such two additional members of the Board of Directors. 
 
 On October 21, 2024, the company declared a third quarter 2024 cash dividend of 0.205 per common share to the holders of common shares. The dividend is payable on December 3, 2024, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on November 14, 2024, with an ex-dividend date of November 14, 2024. 
 
 On October 21, 2024, the company declared a preferred dividend of 14.75 per preferred share, representing the period from September 1, 2024 through November 30, 2024. The preferred dividend is payable on December 2, 2024. 
 
 The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The company has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels and historical dividend payouts. 

Debt 
 
 The carrying value of our debt at September 30, 2024 was 890.3 million (December 31, 2023: 1,489.5 million). See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 4, Debt, for additional disclosures. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company s weighted average cost of debt was 4.70 (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 4.28 ). 
 
 Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of an Adjusted debt/Earnings before income tax, depreciation, amortization, interest expense, common share-based compensation expense, unrealized (gains)/losses from investments, net, and unusual or otherwise non-recurring gains and losses (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00, (ii) an interest coverage ratio (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA/interest expense for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00. As of 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At September 30, 2024, our leverage ratio was 0.26:1.00 (December 31, 2023: 0.69:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 23.96:1.00 (December 31, 2023: 20.40:1.00). 
 
 The September 30, 2024 coverage ratio calculations are as follows: 
 (in millions) Total Q3 2024 Q2 2024 Q1 2024 Q4 2023 Net income/(loss) attributable to Invesco Ltd. (413.6) 55.0 132.2 141.5 (742.3) Dividends on preferred shares 236.8 59.2 59.2 59.2 59.2 Interest expense 62.4 13.4 16.3 15.9 16.8 Tax expense/(benefit) (92.2) 41.5 64.0 68.7 (266.4) Amortization/depreciation/impairment 1,430.8 44.0 46.4 45.1 1,295.3 Common share-based compensation expense 77.8 17.5 18.4 21.1 20.8 One-time acceleration of compensation expense for currently outstanding long-term awards (2)

 393.8 Leverage ratio as of September 30, 2024 (Adjusted debt/Covenant Adjusted EBITDA - maximum 3.25:1.00) 
 0.26 Interest coverage ratio as of September 30, 2024 (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA/Interest expense - minimum 4.00:1.00) 
 23.96 
 (1) Adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our credit agreement, may also include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures. 
 (2) Unusual or otherwise non-recurring gains and losses, as defined in our credit agreement, are adjusted for in the determination of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. A one-time acceleration of 147.6 million in expense resulting from changes to the criteria for retirements for currently outstanding long-term awards recorded in the third quarter of 2024 and a liability related to regulatory matters recorded in the second quarter of 2024 are non-recurring expenses and have been removed from the determination of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. 
 (3) Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted debt are non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management in connection with certain debt covenant calculations under our credit agreement. The calculation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA above (a reconciliation from Net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore Net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to Covenant Adjusted EBI TDA. The calculation of Adjusted debt is defined in our credit agreement and equals debt of 890.3 million plus 3.5 million in letters of credit less 500.0 million of excess unrestricted cash (cash and cash equivalents less the minimum regulatory capital requirement, not to exceed 500 million). 
 
 Credit and Liquidity Risk 
 
 The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk), through measurement and analysis. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. As of September 30, 2024, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent bal ances is 1,044.9 million, of which 548.6 million is invested in affiliated money market funds. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 2, "Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities," for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds. 
 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 Liquidity Risk 
 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they become due. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 890.3 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit agreement, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue. 
 
 Effects of Inflation 
 
 Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. A decline in the values of AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the value of AUM. 

Common Share Repurchase Plan 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 the company repurchased 1.5 million common shares for 25.0 million in the open market (three months ended September 30, 2023: none; nine months ended September 30, 2023 9.6 million common shares for 150.0 million). At September 30, 2024, approximately 357.2 million remains available under the share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board on July 22, 2016. 

Off Balance Sheet Commitments 
 
 See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Contingencies, for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Critical accounting policies are those that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and would therefore be deemed the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Recent Accounting Standards 
 
 See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 1, "Accounting Policies - Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted. 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 In the normal course of its business, the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of AUM market price risk, securities market risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. There have not been any material changes to the company s exposures to market risks during the period ended September 30, 2024 that would require an update to the disclosures provided in the most recent Form 10-K. 
 
 AUM Market Price Risk 
 
 The company s investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of AUM. Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities, commodities and derivatives, or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: 
 
 Causing the value of AUM to decrease. 
 Causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease (impacting performance fees). 
 Causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the company does not serve. 
 Causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that the company manages into investments that the company does not manage. 
 Causing clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher revenues into products that earn lower revenues. 
 
 Underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors. 
 
 Assuming the revenue yield on AUM for the year remains unchanged, a decline in the average AUM for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue. Certain expenses, including distribution and compensation expenses, may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of AUM. As such, the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of AUM may be greater than the percentage decline in the market value of AUM. 
 
 Securities Market Risk 
 
 The company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments are generally made to establish a track record for a new fund or investment vehicle or to hedge economically exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. The company s exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 4, Debt, for details of the company s debt arrangemen ts. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rates on 100.0 of the company s borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 9.15 years, and the company had a zero balance on its floating rate credit agreement. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 The net assets and financial results of the company s foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation into Invesco. 
 
 The company is also exposed to foreign translation risk on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies. Net foreign exchange revaluation losses were 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (nine months ended September 30, 2023: 1.9 million gains) and are included in General and administrative expenses and Other gains/ (losses), net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information the company is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We have evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We have evaluated any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and have concluded that there was no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
