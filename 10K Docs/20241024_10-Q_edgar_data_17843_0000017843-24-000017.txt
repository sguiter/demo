The Company has elected to use the practical expedient that permits a company to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects that at the contract inception, the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. 
 
 Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling activities to fulfill the Company's promise to transfer the goods are included in revenues and costs incurred by the Company for the delivery of goods are classified as cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Shipping terms may vary for products shipped outside the United States depending on the mode of transportation, the country where the material is shipped and any agreements made with the customers. 
 
 Contract liabilities are recognized when the Company has received consideration from a customer to transfer goods or services at a future point in time when the Company performs under the purchase order or contract. Contract liabilities were million and million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Revenue recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was not significant and substantially all of our contract liabilities are recognized within a twelve-month period.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company increased the liability for environmental remediation costs by million. The liabilities recorded for environmental remediation costs at Superfund sites, other third party-owned sites and Carpenter-owned current or former operating facilities remaining at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively. Additionally, the Company has been notified that it may be a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against the Company. Neither the exact amount of remediation costs nor the final method of their allocation among all designated PRPs at these Superfund sites have been determined. Accordingly, at this time the Company cannot reasonably estimate expected costs for such matters. The liability for future environmental remediation costs that can be reasonably estimated is evaluated by management on a quarterly basis. The Company accrues amounts for environmental remediation costs that represent management's best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable future costs related to environmental remediation. 
 
 Estimates of the amount and timing of future costs of environmental remediation requirements are inherently imprecise because of the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements, the availability and application of technology, the identification of currently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the PRPs. Based upon information currently available, such future costs are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows over the long-term. However, such costs could be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular future quarter or year.

 Substantially all of the Company's derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, or similar agreements with each counterparty, which provide for the option to settle contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day and in the same currency. In addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. The Company presents the outstanding derivative contracts on a net basis by counterparty in the consolidated balance sheets.

 According to the provisions of the Company's derivative arrangements, in the event that the fair value of outstanding derivative positions with certain counterparties exceeds certain thresholds, the Company may be required to issue cash collateral to the counterparties. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had cash collateral held by counterparties. 
 
 The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its derivative instruments as well as credit or performance risk with respect to its customer commitments to perform. Although nonperformance is possible, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the parties. In addition, various master netting arrangements are in place with counterparties to facilitate settlements of gains and losses on these contracts.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Background and General 
 
 We are a producer and distributor of premium specialty alloys, including titanium alloys, powder metals, stainless steels, alloy steels and tool steels. We are a recognized leader in high-performance specialty alloy materials and process solutions for critical applications in the aerospace and defense, medical, energy, transportation and industrial and consumer markets. Founded in 1889, we have evolved to become a pioneer in premium specialty alloys including nickel, cobalt, and titanium and material process capabilities that solve our customers' current and future material challenges. We primarily process basic raw materials such as nickel, cobalt, titanium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting, hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet, bar, rod, wire and narrow strip in many sizes and finishes. We also produce certain metal powders and parts. Our sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors. Unlike many other specialty steel producers, we operate our own worldwide network of service and distribution centers. These service centers, located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just-in-time stocking programs. 
 
 As part of our overall business strategy, we have sought out and considered opportunities related to strategic acquisitions and joint collaborations as well as possible business unit dispositions aimed at broadening our offering to the marketplace. We have participated with other companies to explore potential terms and structures of such opportunities and expect that we will continue to evaluate these opportunities. 
 
 Our discussions below in this Item 2 are based upon the more detailed discussions about our business, operations and financial condition included in Item 7 of our 2024 Form 10-K. Our discussions here focus on our results during or as of the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and the comparable period of fiscal year 2024, and to the extent applicable, on material changes from information discussed in the 2024 Form 10-K and other important intervening developments or information that we have reported on Form 8-K. These discussions should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K for detailed background information and with any such intervening Form 8-K.

 Impact of Raw Material Prices and Product Mix 
 
 We value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology. Under the LIFO inventory costing method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials may have been acquired at potentially significantly different values due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw materials to the sale of the processed finished goods to the customers. In a period of rising raw material costs, the LIFO inventory valuation normally results in higher cost of sales. Conversely, in a period of decreasing raw material costs, the LIFO inventory valuation normally results in lower cost of sales. 
 
 The volatility of the costs of raw materials has impacted our operations over the past several years. We, and others in our industry, generally have been able to pass cost increases on major raw materials through to our customers using surcharges that are structured to recover increases in raw material costs. Generally, the formula used to calculate a surcharge is based on published prices of the respective raw materials for the previous month which correlates to the prices we pay for our raw material purchases. However, a portion of our surcharges to customers may be calculated using a different surcharge formula or may be based on the raw material prices at the time of order, which creates a lag between surcharge revenue and corresponding raw material costs recognized in cost of sales. The surcharge mechanism protects our net income on such sales except for the lag effect discussed above. However, surcharges have had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and operating margin percentages as described later in this report. 
 
 Approximately 40 percent of our net sales are sales to customers under firm price sales arrangements. Firm price sales arrangements involve a risk of profit margin fluctuations, particularly when raw material prices are volatile. In order to reduce the risk of fluctuating profit margins on these sales, we enter into commodity forward contracts to purchase certain critical raw materials necessary to produce the related products sold. Firm price sales arrangements generally include certain annual purchasing commitments and consumption schedules agreed to by the customers at selling prices based on raw material prices at the time the arrangements are established. If a customer fails to meet the volume commitments (or the consumption schedule deviates from the agreed-upon terms of the firm price sales arrangements), we may need to absorb the gains or losses associated with the commodity forward contracts on a temporary basis. Gains or losses associated with commodity forward contracts are reclassified to earnings (loss) when earnings are impacted by the hedged transaction. Because we value most of our inventory under the LIFO costing methodology, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period attempting to match the most recently incurred costs with revenues. Gains and/or losses on the commodity forward contracts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) together with the actual purchase price of the underlying commodities when the underlying commodities are purchased and recorded in inventory. To the extent that the total purchase price of the commodities, inclusive of the gains or losses on the commodity forward contracts, are higher or lower relative to the beginning of year costs, our cost of goods sold reflects such amounts. Accordingly, the gains and/or losses associated with commodity forward contracts may not impact the same period that the firm price sales arrangements revenue is recognized, and comparisons of gross profit from period to period may be impacted. These firm price sales arrangements are expected to continue as we look to strengthen our long-term customer relationships by expanding, renewing and, in certain cases, extending to a longer term, our customer arrangements. 
 
 We produce hundreds of grades of materials with a wide range of pricing and profit levels depending on the grade. In addition, our product mix within a period is subject to the fluctuating order patterns of our customers as well as decisions we may make on participation in certain products based on available capacity, including the impacts of capacity commitments we may have under existing customer agreements. While we expect to see positive contribution from a more favorable product mix in our margin performance over time, the impact by period may fluctuate and period-to-period comparisons may vary. 

Net Pension Expense 
 
 Net pension expense, as we define it below, includes the net periodic benefit costs related to both our pension and other postretirement plans. The net periodic benefit costs are determined annually based on beginning of year balances and are recorded ratably throughout the fiscal year, unless a significant remeasurement event occurs. We currently expect the total net pension expense for fiscal year 2025 will be 24.8 million as compared with total net pension expense of 76.0 million in fiscal year 2024. Fiscal year 2024 included a noncash settlement charge of 51.9 million within other expense, net.

 The following is the net pension expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 Pension plans 6.5 6.4 Other postretirement plans (0.3) (0.5) Net pension expense 6.2 5.9 
 
 The service cost component of net pension expense represents the estimated cost of future pension liabilities earned associated with active employees. The pension earnings, interest and deferrals is comprised of the expected return on plan assets, interest costs on the projected benefit obligations of the plans and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and benefits. 
 
 Net pension expense is recorded in accounts that are included in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and other expense, net, based on the function of the associated employees and nature of expense. The following is a summary of the classification of net pension expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Operating Performance Overview and Outlook 
 
 In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we reported operating income of 113.6 million, an increase of 44.6 million compared to the prior year same quarter. Excluding the special item, as identified below, adjusted operating income was 117.2 million. This represents the most profitable first quarter in the Company's history. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 we continued to drive earnings momentum through improved productivity, product mix optimization and pricing actions. Notably, the SAO segment exceeded expectations delivering 134.5 million of operating income with an adjusted operating margin of 26.3 percent, an increase over the prior year same quarter of 19.4 percent. The SAO performance was driven by higher sales and expanding margins and marks the eleventh consecutive quarter with increasing adjusted operating margins in SAO. 
 
 In addition to the strong operating performance, we generated 40.2 million of cash from operating activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with cash generated from operating activities of 7.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. With a strong balance sheet and adjusted free cash flow, we will continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation: sustaining our current asset base to achieve our targets, investing in incremental growth initiatives, and returning cash to stockholders. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 230,000 shares of our common stock on the open market for an aggregate of 32.1 million. 
 
 Although we are navigating near-term uncertainty in the Aerospace supply chain, given the solid execution of the business, strong market position and unique manufacturing capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our operating performance goals and believe our earnings growth journey will extend far beyond fiscal year 2025. 
 
 Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income of 84.8 million, or 1.67 per diluted share. Excluding the special item, as identified below, adjusted earnings per diluted share was 1.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This compares with net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 43.9 million, or 0.88 per diluted share. The results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflect an ongoing improvement in product mix with a shift in capacity to more complex, higher value materials as well as pricing actions and expanding operational efficiencies compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of 3.6 million as a result of actions taken to streamline operations in the Carpenter Additive business as announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 

Net Sales 
 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 717.6 million, which was a 10 percent increase over the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding surcharge revenue, sales increased 17 percent on a 3 percent increase in shipment volume from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The results excluding surcharge revenue reflect realized price increases, improving product mix as well as stronger demand in the end-use markets of Aerospace and Defense and Energy during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding surcharge revenue, sales in the Aerospace and Defense end-use market increased 34 percent compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Geographically, sales in the United States increased 7 percent from the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 421.1 million. Excluding surcharge revenue, domestic sales increased 15 percent from the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by stronger demand in the Aerospace and Defense end-use market. Sales outside the United States increased 15 percent from the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 296.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding surcharge revenue, sales outside the United States increased 21 percent from the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting stronger demand in the Aerospace and Defense end-use market in the European and South America regions as well as higher sales in the Medical and Energy end-use markets in the European and Asia Pacific regions compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. A portion of our sales outside the United States are denominated in foreign currencies. The fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 0.1 million decrease in net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net sales outside the United States represented 41 percent and 40 percent of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Gross Profit 
 
 Our gross profit in the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased to 176.3 million, or 24.6 percent of net sales, as compared with 124.1 million, or 19.0 percent of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of surcharge revenue, our adjusted gross margin in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 30.5 percent as compared to 25.2 percent in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increased gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects an ongoing improvement in product mix with a shift in capacity to more complex, higher value materials as well as pricing actions and expanding operational efficiencies. 
 
 Our surcharge mechanism is structured to recover increases in raw material costs, although in certain cases with a lag effect as discussed above. While the surcharge generally protects the absolute gross profit dollars, it does have a dilutive effect on gross margin as a percent of sales. We present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of these items provides a more consistent and meaningful basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. See the section "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for further discussion of these financial measures. The following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharge on gross margin. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 Net sales 717.6 651.9 Less: surcharge revenue 140.2 159.1 Net sales excluding surcharge revenue 577.4 492.8 Gross profit 176.3 124.1 Gross margin 24.6 19.0 Gross margin excluding surcharge revenue 30.5 25.2 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 59.1 million or 8.2 percent of net sales (10.2 percent of net sales excluding surcharge) as compared with 55.1 million or 8.5 percent of net sales (11.2 percent of net sales excluding surcharge) in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflect higher salary, benefit and variable compensation costs compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring and asset impairment charges were 3.6 million, compared to no restructuring and asset impairment charges in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring charges were a result of actions taken to streamline operations in our Carpenter Additive business in the PEP segment, as announced in the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 12.4 million compared with 12.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Capitalized interest reduced interest expense by 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The lower interest expense, net is due to no short-term borrowings under our Credit Facility in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest on borrowings in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other Expense, Net 
 
 Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.1 million as compared with 4.0 million of other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2024, reflects 3.9 million of expense from pension earnings, interest and deferrals partially offset by interest income and favorable market returns on investments used to fund Company-owned life insurance contracts and investments held in rabbi trusts. The three months ended September 30, 2023 includes 3.5 million of expense from pension earnings, interest and deferrals.

 Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense was 16.3 million, or 16.1 percent of pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with income tax expense of 8.4 million, or 16.1 percent of pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes discrete tax benefits of 6.8 million attributable to employee share-based compensation and 0.9 million for the impact of restructuring charges. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, included a discrete tax benefit of 4.1 million attributable to employee share-based compensation. Also included was the unfavorable impact of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit can be recognized. 
 
 On October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") released a statement on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges of the digital economy. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two model rules defining a 15 percent global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected by calendar year 2024. We determined the Pillar Two Framework does not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 Specialty Alloys Operations Segment 
 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the SAO segment increased 13 percent to 645.1 million, as compared with 570.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding surcharge revenue, net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 22 percent on flat shipment volume compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The higher sales excluding surcharge revenue in the SAO segment reflect double-digit percentage growth in the end-use markets of Aerospace and Defense, Medical and Energy driven by productivity gains, stronger product mix and pricing actions compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Operating income for the SAO segment was 134.5 million or 20.8 percent of net sales (26.3 percent of net sales excluding surcharge revenue) in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with operating income of 80.8 million or 14.2 percent of net sales (19.4 percent of net sales excluding surcharge revenue) in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects stronger product mix and improved operational efficiencies compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Performance Engineered Products Segment 
 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the PEP segment decreased 1 percent to 100.8 million, as compared with 101.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding surcharge revenue, net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1 percent on 14 percent higher shipment volume compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The current quarter results reflect lower sales in the Distribution end-use market partially offset by higher sales in the Medical end-use market. The three months ended September 30, 2024 also reflect fewer shipment days due to mandatory weather-related closures. 
 
 Operating income for the PEP segment was 7.3 million or 7.2 percent of net sales (7.9 percent of net sales excluding surcharge revenue) in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with operating income of 9.1 million or 8.9 percent of net sales (9.8 percent of net sales excluding surcharge revenue) in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The lower results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflect weaker demand conditions and lower margins compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Financial Resources 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash from operating activities of 40.2 million as compared to 7.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our adjusted free cash flow, which we define under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below, was positive 13.3 million as compared to negative 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement in cash from operating activities and adjusted free cash flow for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from higher earnings after noncash adjustments to net income partially offset by higher pension contributions and capital expenditures compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used to build inventory was 16.8 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 67.8 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash used for accounts receivable was 3.4 million compared to 18.4 million of cash generated from accounts receivable in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Capital expenditures for property, plant, equipment and software were 26.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In fiscal year 2025, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 125.0 million. 
 
 We evaluate liquidity needs for alternative uses including funding external growth opportunities, share repurchases as well as funding consistent dividend payments to stockholders. Dividends for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 10.1 million as compared to 9.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we declared and paid quarterly dividends of 0.20 per share. Additionally, we will discretionarily use excess cash for a share repurchase program up to 400.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The primary use of this program will be to offset dilution. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 230,000 shares of our common stock on the open market for an aggregate of 32.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, 367.9 million remains available for future purchases.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made pension contributions of 9.6 million to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We currently expect to contribute 17.0 million to our qualified defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of fiscal year 2025. 
 
 We have demonstrated the ability to generate cash to meet our needs through cash flows from operations, management of working capital and the ability to access capital markets to supplement internally generated funds. We target minimum liquidity of 150.0 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents added to available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. 
 
 On April 14, 2023, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer and the other lenders, agents and arrangers party thereto. The Credit Facility amended and restated our then existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 26, 2021, which had been set to expire on March 31, 2024. The Credit Facility extends the maturity to April 12, 2028. 
 
 The Credit Facility is a secured revolving credit facility with a commitment of 350.0 million subject to our right, from time to time, to request an increase of the commitment by the greater of (i) 300.0 million or (ii) an amount equal to our consolidated EBITDA; and provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to a 40.0 million sub-limit. We have the right to voluntarily prepay and re-borrow loans, to terminate or reduce the commitments under the Credit Facility, and, subject to certain lender approvals, to join subsidiaries as subsidiary borrowers. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing rate for the Credit Facility was 7.09 however, we had no short-term borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.1 million of issued letters of credit under the Credit Facility and the balance of the Credit Facility, 348.9 million, remains available to us. 
 
 We believe that our total liquidity of 499.1 million as of September 30, 2024, which includes total cash and cash equivalents of 150.2 million and available borrowing capacity of 348.9 million under the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our cash needs over the foreseeable future. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 22.2 million held at various foreign subsidiaries. Our global cash deployment considers, among other things, the geographic and institutional location of our subsidiaries' cash balances, the locations of our anticipated liquidity needs and the cost to access international cash balances, as necessary. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repatriate cash from foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, we may make short-term intercompany borrowings against our cash held outside the United States in order to reduce or eliminate any required borrowing under our Credit Facility. 
 
 We are subject to certain financial and restrictive covenants under the Credit Facility which requires the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 4.00 to 1.00. The restrictions of these covenants (other than the financial ratio covenants) are subject to certain exceptions or threshold triggering amounts or events specified in the Credit Facility, and in some cases the restrictions may be waived by the lenders. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility. 
 
 The following table shows our actual ratio performance with respect to the financial covenants as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 Covenant Covenant Requirement Actual Ratio Consolidated interest coverage ratio 3.00 to 1.00 (minimum) 11.14 to 1.00 Consolidated net leverage ratio 4.00 to 1.00 (maximum) 1.05 to 1.00 
 
 To the extent that we do not comply with the current or modified covenants under the Credit Facility, this could reduce our liquidity and flexibility due to potential restrictions on borrowings available to us unless we are able to obtain waivers or modifications of the covenants.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The following provides additional information regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures that we use in this report. Our definitions and calculations of these items may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies. 
 
 Net Sales and Gross Margin Excluding Surcharge Revenue 
 
 This report includes discussions of net sales as adjusted to exclude the impact of raw material surcharge and the resulting impact on gross margin, which represent financial measures that have not been determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). We present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of raw material surcharge from net sales provides a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period for the reasons discussed earlier in this report. Management uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, our Board of Directors and others. See our earlier discussion of "Gross Profit" for a reconciliation of net sales and gross margin, excluding surcharge revenue, to net sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Net sales and gross margin excluding surcharge revenue is not a U.S. GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net sales and gross margin calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin Excluding Surcharge Revenue and Special Items 
 
 This report includes discussions of operating income and operating margin as adjusted to exclude the impact of raw material surcharge revenue and special items which represent financial measures that have not been determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of raw material surcharge from net sales provides a more consistent and meaningful basis for comparing results of operations from period to period for the reasons discussed earlier in this report. In addition, management believes that excluding special items from operating income and operating margin is helpful in analyzing our operating performance, as these items are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, our Board of Directors and others. See our earlier discussion of operating income for a reconciliation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin excluding surcharge revenue and special items to operating income and operating margin determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin excluding surcharge revenue and special items are not U.S. GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income and operating margin calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Adjusted Earnings Per Share

 Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 49.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Management believes that the presentation of earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of special items is helpful in analyzing the operating performance of the Company, as these items are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company's Board of Directors and others. Our definitions and calculations of these items may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies. Adjusted earnings per share is not a U.S. GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, earnings per share calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 
 This report includes discussions of adjusted free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to adjusted free cash flow reported by other companies. The following provides a reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow, as used in this report, to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided from operating activities 40.2 7.4 Purchases of property, plant, equipment and software (26.9) (22.0) Adjusted free cash flow 13.3 (14.6) 
 Management believes that the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it is a measure of cash generated which management evaluates for alternative uses. It is management's current intention to use excess cash to fund investments in capital equipment, acquisition opportunities and consistent dividend payments. Additionally, we will discretionally use excess cash for a share repurchase program up to 400.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The primary use of this program will be to offset dilution. Adjusted free cash flow is not a U.S. GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, cash flows calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Contingencies 
 
 Environmental 
 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to pollution, protection of public health and the environment, natural resource damages and occupational safety and health. Although compliance with these laws and regulations may affect the costs of our operations, compliance costs to date have not been material. We have environmental remediation liabilities at some of our owned operating facilities and have been designated as a PRP with respect to certain third party Superfund waste-disposal sites and other third party-owned sites. We accrue amounts for environmental remediation costs that represent our best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable future costs related to environmental remediation. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we increased the liability for environmental remediation costs by 0.1 million. The liabilities recorded for environmental remediation costs at Superfund sites, other third party-owned sites and Carpenter-owned current or former operating facilities remaining at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were 17.4 million and 17.3 million, respectively. Additionally, we have been notified that we may be a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against us. Neither the exact amount of remediation costs nor the final method of their allocation among all designated PRPs at these Superfund sites have been determined. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate expected costs for such matters. The liability for future environmental remediation costs that can be reasonably estimated is evaluated on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Estimates of the amount and timing of future costs of environmental remediation requirements are inherently imprecise because of the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements, the availability and application of technology, the identification of currently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the PRPs. Based upon information currently available, such future costs are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows over the long-term. However, such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular future quarter or year. 
 
 Other 
 
 We are defending various routine claims and legal actions that are incidental to our business, and that are common to our operations, including those pertaining to product claims, commercial disputes, patent infringement, employment actions, employee benefits, compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, personal injury claims and tax issues. Like many other manufacturing companies in recent years we, from time to time, have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to chemicals and substances in the workplace such as asbestos. We provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing (both as to recording future charges to operations and cash expenditures) of the resolution of such matters. While it is not feasible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that the total liability from these matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows over the long-term. However, there can be no assurance that an increase in the scope of pending matters or that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular future quarter or year.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 A summary of other significant accounting policies is discussed in our 2024 Form 10-K Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 thereto. 
 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over the fair value of the assets based upon estimated future discounted cash flows. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment by individual business unit. Changes in estimated cash flows could have a significant impact on whether or not an asset is impaired and the amount of the impairment. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested at least annually for impairment as of June 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. Effective in fiscal year 2022, and prospectively, we will perform the required annual goodwill impairment test as of June 1 rather than on June 30 which was our previous practice. We believe this change is preferable as it more closely aligns with the timing of our annual budgeting process. We do not believe this change resulted in any delay, acceleration or avoidance of impairment. Furthermore, a retrospective application to prior periods is impracticable as we are unable to objectively determine, without the use of hindsight, the assumptions which would be used in earlier periods. 
 
 Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any impairment loss is measured by the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The discounted cash flow analysis for each reporting unit tested requires significant estimates and assumptions related to cash flow forecasts, discount rates, terminal values and income tax rates. The cash flow forecasts include significant judgments and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, which include perpetual growth rates, gross margin and weighted average cost of capital. The cash flow forecasts are developed based on assumptions about each reporting unit's markets, product offerings, pricing, capital expenditure and working capital requirements as well as cost performance. 
 
 The discount rates used in the discounted cash flow are estimated based on a market participant's perspective of each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. The terminal value, which represents the value attributed to the reporting unit beyond the forecast period, is estimated using a perpetuity growth rate assumption. The income tax rates used in the discounted cash flow analysis represent estimates of the long-term statutory income tax rates for each reporting unit based on the jurisdictions in which the reporting units operate. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have two reporting units with goodwill recorded. Goodwill associated with the SAO reporting unit as of September 30, 2024, was 195.5 million and represents 86 percent of total goodwill. The remaining goodwill recorded as of September 30, 2024, of 31.8 million is associated with the Dynamet reporting unit in the PEP segment. The fair value for both reporting units is estimated using a weighting of discounted cash flows and the use of market multiples valuation techniques. 
 
 Goodwill associated with the SAO reporting unit is tested at the SAO segment level. As of June 1, 2024, the fair value of the SAO reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 203 percent. The discounted cash flows analysis for the SAO reporting unit includes assumptions related to our ability to increase volume, improve mix, expand product offerings and continue to implement opportunities to reduce costs over the next several years. For purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis for SAO's fair value, a weighted average cost capital of 9.5 percent and a terminal growth rate assumption of 2.5 percent were used. If the long-term growth rate for this reporting unit had been hypothetically reduced by 0.5 percent at June 1, 2024, the SAO reporting unit would have a fair value that exceeded the carrying value by approximately 196 percent. 
 
 Goodwill associated with the PEP segment is tested at the Dynamet reporting unit level. As of June 1, 2024, the fair value of the Dynamet reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 144 percent. For purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis for Dynamet's fair value, a weighted average cost capital of 11.0 percent and a terminal growth rate assumption of 2.5 percent were used. If the long-term growth rate for this reporting unit had been hypothetically reduced by 0.5 percent at June 1, 2024, the Dynamet reporting unit would have a fair value that exceeded the carrying value by approximately 140 percent. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

The estimate of fair value requires significant judgment. We based our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our business units. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill and identifiable intangible asset testing as of the time of testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding business projections, competitive environments or anticipated growth rates are not correct, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or earlier, if an indicator of an impairment is present before our next annual evaluation. We continuously monitor for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value of our reporting units.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We use derivative financial instruments to reduce certain types of financial risk. Firm price sales arrangements involve a risk of profit margin fluctuations particularly as raw material prices have been volatile. Firm price sales arrangements generally include certain annual purchasing commitments and consumption schedules agreed to by the customers at selling prices based on raw material prices at the time the arrangements are established. As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, "Financial Statements," in order to reduce the risk of fluctuating profit margins on these sales, we enter into commodity forward contracts to purchase certain critical raw materials necessary to produce the products sold under the firm price sales arrangements. If a customer fails to perform its obligations under the firm price sales arrangements, we may realize losses as a result of the related commodity forward contracts. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.1 million of net deferred losses related to commodity forward contracts to purchase certain raw materials. A large portion of this balance is related to commodity forward contracts to support firm price sales arrangements associated with many customers in addition to credit already extended to these customers in connection with outstanding trade receivables. Our customers have historically performed under these arrangements, and we believe that they will honor such obligations in the future. 
 
 We are actively involved in managing risks associated with energy resources. Risk containment strategies include interaction with primary and secondary energy suppliers as well as obtaining adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for potential business interruption related to lack of availability of energy resources. In addition, we have used forwards to fix the price of a portion of our anticipated future purchases of certain energy requirements to protect against the impact of significant increases in energy costs. We also use surcharge mechanisms to offset a portion of these charges where appropriate. 
 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could subject us to risk of losses on anticipated future cash flows from our international operations or customers. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge certain foreign exchange risk. 
 
 Historically, we have used interest rate swaps to achieve a level of floating rate debt relative to fixed rate debt where appropriate. From time to time, we have entered into forward interest rate swap contracts to manage the risk of cash flow variability associated with fixed interest debt expected to be issued. 
 
 All hedging strategies are reviewed and approved by senior financial management before being implemented. Senior financial management has established policies regarding the use of derivative instruments that prohibit the use of speculative or leveraged derivatives. 
 
 Based on the current funding level, the benchmark allocation policy for the Company's largest pension plan assets is to have approximately 75 percent in return seeking assets and 25 percent in liability-hedging assets. Return seeking assets include global equities, diversified credit and real assets. Liability-hedging assets include bond funds and cash. When the funding level of the plan reaches 95 percent and improves to fully or over-funded status in increments of 5 percent, assets will be shifted from return seeking to liability-hedging assets in accordance with the glidepath policy outlined in the pension plan's Investment Policy Statement. 
 
 The status of our financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 is provided in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Assuming either of the following occurred on September 30, 2024, (a) an instantaneous 10 percent decrease in the price of raw materials and energy for which we have commodity forward contracts, or (b) a 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies for which foreign exchange forward contracts existed, our results of operations would not have been materially affected in either scenario.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required under the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, including a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Pending legal proceedings involve ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, which we do not believe would have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of their outcome. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contingencies." 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 We have evaluated the risks associated with our business and operations and determined that those risk factors included in Part 1, Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K adequately disclose the material risks that we face.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 In July 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 400.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. There is no stated expiration for the share repurchase program. The shares may be repurchased from time to time at our discretion based on capital needs of the business, general market conditions and market price of the stock. The timing or amount of the shares to be repurchased cannot be assured. The share repurchase program may be discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024, 367.9 million of the 400.0 million remained available for future purchases. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased 230,000 shares pursuant to the terms of the share repurchase program. 
 
 The following table contains information about purchases by us of our common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number (or Approximate Dollar Value) of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (in millions) July 1-31, 2024 400.0 August 1-31, 2024 230,000 139.5 230,000 367.9 September 1-30, 2024 367.9 Quarter ended September 30, 2024 
 230,000 139.5 230,000 367.9 
 
 In addition to the share repurchase program, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 165,737 shares, at an average purchase price of 132.99, were surrendered by employees to the Company for the payment of the minimum tax liability withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock as well as the cost and tax obligations of stock options exercised. We do not consider this a share buyback program.
