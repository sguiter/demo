 Components of Our Results of Operations Revenues Platform subscriptions Platform subscriptions revenues consist primarily of user fees to provide our clients access to our SaaS solution. Fees consider various components such as number of users, connectivity, trading volume, data usage, and product coverage. Platform subscription clients do not have the right to take possession of the platform s software and do not have any general return right. Platform subscriptions revenues are recognized ratably over the period of contractually enforceable rights and obligations, beginning on the date that the client gains access to the platform. Fees are generally invoiced at the end of each calendar month during the subscription term. There is no financing available. Managed services Managed services revenues primarily consist of client-selected middle- and back-office, technology-powered services. Managed services revenues are recognized ratably over the period of contractually enforceable rights and obligations, beginning on the contract effective date. Clients are invoiced a set fee for managed services typically at the end of each month. Generally, invoices have a 30-day payment period in accordance with the associated contract. There is no financing available. Other Other revenues consist of non-subscription-based revenue, primarily data conversion. We recognize revenues as these services are performed with invoicing generally occurring at the end of each month. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs associated with the delivery of our software and services, including base salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and related costs. Additionally, cost of revenues includes amortization of capitalized software development costs, allocated overhead, certain direct data and hosting costs, and stock-based compensation expense. Our cost of revenues has fixed and variable components and depends on the revenues earned in each period. We expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire personnel to provide onboarding and account management services to our growing client base. Market data expenses are also expected to increase in absolute dollars. Operating Expenses General and administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, and administrative personnel. These personnel costs and related expenses include salaries, benefits and bonuses, fees for external legal and other consulting services, and stock-based compensation expense.

 Technology and development Technology and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses related to our software development, including the development of non-enhancing features, maintenance, quality assurance, and ongoing refinement of our existing solutions. In addition, it includes expenses related to the exploration of new technologies and costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities which are expensed as incurred. We expect certain expenses to increase as we continue to scale and expand our client base and geographic footprint. Income Taxes Enfusion Ltd. LLC has historically been and is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal tax purposes and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. Income tax provision represents the income tax expense or benefit associated with our foreign operations based on the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Since its incorporation, Enfusion, Inc. has been subject to U.S. federal income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any U.S. taxable income of Enfusion Ltd. LLC and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. Enfusion, Inc. is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes. Accordingly, a provision for income taxes is recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations. We estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We regularly assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets as a crucial component of our tax strategy. As of September 30, 2024, our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, remain subject to valuation allowances. However, depending on our financial performance, our evaluation of the realization of our net deferred tax assets could result in the release of some or all of the valuation allowances. If this release occurs, it will lead to a significant non-cash income tax benefit in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and the recognition of additional deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If we obtain enough positive evidence in future quarters, we may determine that all or a substantial portion of the valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets are no longer needed. For further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to Note 12, Income Taxes , in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Non-Controlling Interests Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss, net assets, and comprehensive (loss) income of Enfusion Ltd. LLC that is not allocable to the Company based on our percentage of ownership of this entity. Income or loss attributed to the non-controlling interests is based on the Common Units outstanding during the period and is presented on the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Enfusion Ltd. LLC is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, exempting it from any entity-level U.S. federal income tax obligations. Instead, taxable income is apportioned among its members, encompassing Enfusion, Inc. and its subsidiaries and non-controlling interests (collectively called Members ). In partnership structures, it is common for the partnership to advance cash to its members to assist with their estimated quarterly tax payments. Such advances are deducted from future distributions from the partnership. Under the LLC Operating Agreement, Enfusion Ltd. LLC is obligated to make quarterly cash distributions to its members to cover their estimated quarterly tax payments Tax Distributions ). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Enfusion Ltd. LLC made Tax Distributions of 136 thousand to non-controlling interest holders.

We believe that our current sources of liquidity, cash flows from operations and existing available cash, together with our other available external financing sources, will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. We expect that our future uses of cash will also include paying obligations under our Tax Receivable Agreement, tax distributions under our LLC Operating Agreement, and income taxes. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or services, which could decrease our cash and cash equivalents and increase our cash requirements. As a result of these and other factors, we could use our available capital resources sooner than expected and may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Cash Flow Information The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated.

Cash paid for annual bonuses during the nine months ended September

 30, 2023 was 8.4 million. Cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included a 1.5 million cash outflow related to the return of funds to FTV Fund IV. The decrease in cash paid related to annual bonuses is attributable to the fact that part of the 2023 Annual Bonus Incentive Plan was paid in stock. Refer to Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. Investing activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 11.2 million attributable to 5.5 million of capitalized software development costs and 2.7 million of property and equipment purchases. In addition, we invested in a privately-held technology company which resulted in a 3.0 million cash outflow in exchange for an unsecured convertible promissory note. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash outflows included 4.1 million of capitalized software development costs and 3.2 million of property and equipment purchases. Financing activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 1.4 million in cash flows from financing activities, including 1.3 million in payments of withholding taxes on stock-based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we used 42.5 million in cash flows resulting primarily from 59.9 million in payments of withholding taxes on stock-based compensation, offset by 17.3 million in net stock issuance proceeds and a refund from the Internal Revenue Service of approximately 1.5 million related to FTV Enfusion Holdings, Inc. LLC for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2020. We obtained the rights to this refund as a result of the merger of FTV Enfusion Holdings, Inc. with and into one of our subsidiaries in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. Indebtedness On September 15, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with Bank of America and a syndicate of lending institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 100.0 million, including a 10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a swingline subfacility of up to 10.0 million. The Credit Agreement also includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows for up to 50.0 million of additional borrowing capacity, subject to obtaining lender commitments and the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. We were in compliance with all loan covenants and requirements as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 99.9 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement, with the remaining 100 thousand issued as a letter of credit in the second quarter of 2024. Concurrent with entering into the Credit Agreement on September 15, 2023, the Company terminated its 5.0 million revolving credit agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which by its terms was scheduled to mature on December 17, 2025. At the time of termination, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement. On June 21, 2024, the Company executed the First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Amendment ). Among other things, the Amendment modified the definition of Permitted Acquisitions within the Credit Agreement by removing a fixed maximum aggregate purchase price for all acquisitions and instead requiring that the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio after each acquisition not exceed 3:1 after giving effect to an acquisition. Refer to Note 7, Debt , in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the Credit Agreement.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements If it has taxable income, Enfusion Ltd. LLC may be obligated to make quarterly cash distributions under the LLC Operating Agreement to its members to cover their estimated quarterly tax payments. As of September 30, 2024, we have operating lease agreements and have service agreements for the use of data processing facilities, which are also leases under ASC 842, Leases . As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that may be material to investors. Dividend Policy Assuming Enfusion Ltd. LLC makes any distributions to its members in any given year, any determination to pay dividends to our Class A common stockholders out of any portion of such distributions remaining after the payment of our obligations and expenses will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time. Tax Receivable Agreement The payment obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement is an obligation of Enfusion, Inc. and not of Enfusion Ltd. LLC. We expect that as a result of the size of the existing tax basis and basis adjustments acquired in the IPO, the increase in existing tax basis and the anticipated tax basis adjustment of the tangible and intangible assets of Enfusion Ltd. LLC upon the purchase or exchange (or deemed exchange) of Common Units for shares of Class A common stock or distributions (or deemed distributions) with respect to Common Units and our possible utilization of certain tax attributes, the payments that we may make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate the amount of existing tax basis and basis adjustments acquired in the IPO to be approximately 364.7 million. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual cash tax benefits that Enfusion, Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and/or if distributions directly and/or indirectly to Enfusion, Inc. by Enfusion Ltd. LLC are not sufficient to permit Enfusion, Inc. to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement after it has paid taxes and other expenses. Late payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will accrue interest at an uncapped rate equal to one-year LIBOR (or its successor rate) plus 500 basis points. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the Pre-IPO Owners. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such difference may be material. For a discussion of how these and other factors may affect our business, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The critical accounting estimates that we believe affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on

 Form 10-Q are described under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Emerging Growth Company Status We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act ), and, for so long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions relate to, among other things, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from being required to: comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation, and seek shareholder approval of certain golden parachute payments. In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we: (i) are no longer an emerging growth company; or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to our market risk during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.
