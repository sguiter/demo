warrants to purchase shares of common stock at per share at per warrant. (See Note 16.) 

Basis
of Presentation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and include the Company s
wholly-owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation process. Certain accounts
relating to the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation. These reclassifications had
no effect on the net loss or net assets as previously reported. 

Stock
Split On May 11, 2024, the Board and stockholders of the Company approved, and on May 14, 2024 the Company
effected, a .57-for-1 reverse stock split. All share and per share numbers included in these Financial Statements as of and for all periods
presented reflect the effect of that stock split unless otherwise noted. 

Unaudited
Interim Financial Information The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024,
the condensed consolidated statement of operations and the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders deficit, for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments,
which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the Company s financial position as of September 30,
2024 and the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The
financial data and other information disclosed in these notes related to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 are also unaudited. The results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative
of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, any other interim periods, or any future year or period. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the Company s audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company s registration statement on Form S-1, as
amended (File No. 333-279382). These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

million, (of which approximately ) stemmed from the net (decrease) in fair value of certain convertible notes, and warrants).
During the and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net income of approximately million (of
which approximately million stemmed from the net increase in fair value of certain convertible notes, warrants and contingencies
and approximately million stemmed from the net gain recognized on investments). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company reported net cash used in operations of approximately million. On September 30, 2024, the accumulated deficit was
approximately million and the stockholders deficit was approximately million. Excluding the approximately
 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increase in fair value million inception to date
increase in fair value) of the aforementioned convertible notes, warrants and contingencies: the Company would have incurred a net loss
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately million; at September 30, 2024, the accumulated
deficit would have been approximately million; and the stockholders deficit would have been approximately million.
In connection with these condensed consolidated financial statements, management evaluated whether there were conditions and events, considered
in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to meet its obligations as they become due within one
year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. Management assessed that there were such conditions and events, including
a history of recurring operating losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities, and significant current debt obligations.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company believes its current cash balances coupled with anticipated cash flow from operating activities
may not be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for at least one year from the date of the issuance of the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements.

had previously incurred deferred transaction costs related to a proposed Business Combination Agreement that was terminated May 18 2023,
with related deferred transaction costs then being expensed (in the quarter ended June 30, 2023). Subsequent to the termination
of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company prepared for an initial public offering IPO (which the Company successfully
consummated on November 25, 2024). Accordingly, the deferred offering costs relating to the Company s contemplated IPO continued
to be deferred and capitalized as incurred as of September 30, 2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, in November 2024, the deferred
offering costs relating to the Company s contemplated IPO were offset against IPO proceeds upon the consummation of the Company s

Note 5 Payment Upon Sale of Flavored Bourbon, LLC. In January 2024, Flavored Bourbon LLC conducted a
capital call, seeking to raise million from current and new investors at the same valuation as the last raise (which was in
2021). The Company chose not to participate in the raise, but still retained its rights to full recovery of is capital account of
 million, with the Company being guaranteed a pay out of this million in the event the brand is sold to a third
party, or the Company can block such sale. As of September 30, 2024, a total of of the million was raised,
with the remainder targeted to be raised by the end of 2024. As a result of the January 2024 capital call, which was the first triggering event
to perform a review of the fair value of its Investment in Flavored Bourbon, LLC since the prior transaction in 2021, in accordance
with adjusting for observable price changes for similar investments of the same issuer pursuant to ASC 321 as noted above, the
Company performed a qualitative assessment of its Investment in Flavored Bourbon, LLC. The Company determined that the Class E Units
being offered were similar enough to the Company s investment in Class A Units (with differences including the Class A
Units liquidation preference seniority and preferential voting rights related to sale or liquidation) to trigger a
reassessment of the value of the Company s Investment in Flavored Bourbon LLC, which was done using the Option Pricing Model
Backsolve Valuation Method OPM Backsolve Valuation Method ). The Company s analysis determined the fair
value of its Investment in Flavored Bourbon, LLC, should be adjusted to as of June 30, 2024 from recorded
previously, with the resulting increase in fair value of recorded as gain on increase in value of Flavored Bourbon, LLC

borrowing capacity of . The Silverview Loan originally matured on April 15, 2025, which was extended to October 25, 2026
as part of the Silverview Loan modification executed subsequent to September 30, 2024 (on October 1, 2024). The Silverview Loan accrued
interest through the 18-month anniversary of the closing date at (i) a fixed rate of , which portion was payable in cash, and
(ii) at a fixed rate of , which portion was payable in kind and added to the outstanding obligations as principal. Effective
on the 19 th month anniversary of the closing date, the Silverview Loan accrues interest at a fixed rate of through maturity.

including working capital needs and capital expenditures. The Company violated various financial and other debt covenants regarding
its failure to comply with the financial covenants and to timely furnish its consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2023. As the chance of meeting the same or more restrictive covenants at subsequent compliance measurement dates
within the following year was remote, the Company determined that the Silverview Loan should be classified as a current liability as
of December 31, 2023. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the Silverview
Loan was . The lender had previously agreed to waive any existing covenant compliance matters as of December 31,
2022 and to forbear exercising its rights and remedies under the loan agreement through December 31, 2023.

time, the value of the shares and prepaid warrants will be recorded as common stock at the IPO price of per share, and the remaining
fair value of the Convertible Notes will be recognized as Change in Value of Convertible Notes on the Company s condensed consolidated
statement of operations. (See Note 16.) 

Valuation of Acquisition Contingency Liability
 In conjunction with the Thinking Tree Spirits acquisition, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded estimated
fair values of in estimated future contingent payments. The acquisition was recorded at a fair value probability applied to
the contingent earn out payments based on assumptions made at that time. The fair value of the acquisition will be re-measured for each
subsequent reporting period until resolution of the contingent earn out payments, and any resulting increases or decreases in fair value,
are recorded on the income statement as an operating loss or gain. The recorded fair value of the acquisition was reviewed as of June
30, 2024, with a decrease in valuation for the contingent earn out payments to , resulting in a decrease in fair value recorded
on the income statement as an operating gain of for the period ended June 30, 2024. (See Note 10.) As of September 30, 2024,
the recorded fair value of the acquisition was reviewed, with no further change in fair value. 

Valuation of Convertible Notes The
fair value of the Convertible Notes at issuance and at each reporting period is estimated based on significant inputs not observable
in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company used a probability weighted expected
return method PWERM and the Discounted Cash Flow DCF method to incorporate estimates and assumptions
concerning the Company s prospects and market indications into a model to estimate the value of the notes. The most significant
estimates and assumptions used as inputs in the PWERM and DCF valuation techniques impacting the fair value of the 2022 Notes are the
timing and probability of an IPO, deSPAC Merger and default scenario outcomes (see the table below). Specifically, the Company discounted
the cash flows for fixed payments that were not sensitive to the equity value of the Company at payment by using annualized discount
rates that were applied across valuation dates from issuance dates of the Convertible Notes to September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023. The discount rates were based on certain considerations including time to payment, an assessment of the credit position of the
Company, market yields of companies with similar credit risk at the date of valuation estimation, and calibrated rates based on the fair
value relative to the original issue price from the Convertible Notes.

Valuation of Warrant Liabilities The
fair value of the warrant liabilities at issuance and at each reporting period was estimated based on significant inputs not observable
in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The warrants are free-standing instruments
and determined to be liability-classified in accordance with ASC 480. The Company used the PWERM and the Monte Carlo Simulation MCS to incorporate estimates and assumptions concerning the Company s prospects and market indications into the
models to estimate the value of the warrants. The most significant estimates and assumptions used as inputs in the PWERM and MCS valuation
techniques impacting the fair value of the warrant liabilities are the timing and probability of IPO, deSPAC Merger and default scenario
outcomes (see the table below). The most significant estimates and assumptions used as inputs in the PWERM and MCS valuation techniques
impacting the fair value of the warrant liabilities are those utilizing certain weighted average assumptions such as expected stock price
volatility, expected term of the warrants, and risk-free interest rates.

to purchase common stock were exercised into shares of common stock. 

Prepaid Warrants to Purchase Common Stock
-- In August 2024, certain holders of shares of common stock agreed to exchange an aggregate of shares of their common
stock into a like number of pre-paid warrants. Such pre-paid warrants will be eligible for exercise without the payment of additional
consideration at any time that the respective holder beneficially owns a number of shares of common stock that is less than of

and vesting of ISOs ceases upon termination of service to the Company. Vested ISOs are exercisable for three months after the date
of termination of service. The terms and conditions of any ISO shall comply in all respects with Section 422 of the Code, or any
successor provision, and any applicable regulations thereunder. The exercise price of each ISO is the fair market value of the Company s
stock on the applicable date of grant. The Company used the mean volatility estimate from Carta s 409A valuation based on the median
5-year volumes of select peer companies. Fair value is estimated based on a combination of shares being sold at up through February
of 2019 and the most recent 409A completed when these ISOs were issued in April of 2018 valuing the Company s stock at 
per share. No ISOs may be granted more than ten (10) years after the earlier of the approval by the Board, or the stockholders,

During the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, the Company recognized no stock-based compensation expense in connection with RSU awards granted under the plans. Compensation
expense for RSU awards is recognized upon meeting both the time-vesting condition and the triggering event condition. During the three

In May 2024, RSUs were voluntarily terminated, leaving issued RSUs to settle at a grant value of per unit.
In May 2024, the Board of Directors approved awarding RSUs to employees, directors and consultants with a fair grant value
of per unit. These RSUs contain a double trigger and, upon grant, were deemed to have met their time-based service requirements
for vesting. They will settle on the expiration of the Market Stand-off provision in the 2019 stock incentive plan (or May 24, 2025,

in May 2023, certain senior level employees elected to defer a portion of their salary until such time as the Company completed
a successful public registration of its stock (which occurred subsequent to September 30, 2024, on November 25, 2024). Upon success of
the Company s initial public offering, each employee will then be paid their deferred salary plus dollars in RSUs or stock options
(under the new 2024 Plan noted above) for every dollar of deferred salary. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded approximately
 including employer tax obligation of such deferred payroll expense, in accrued liabilities. Accordingly, as of September 30,
2024 the Company has also committed to issue approximately in equity compensation related to the deferred compensation.

to a true-up provision (to the price per share of the Company s anticipated IPO, if lower as of September 30, 2024: 
per share or shares) that expired on August 31, 2024. 

In September 2024, the Company extended the true-up
provision under the terms of the TTS stock sale from August 31, 2024 to the date of settlement of the Thinking Tree Spirits Dissenters
Rights Process, resulting in the delay in reclassifying the TTS purchase price liability to equity (under ASC-480). Subsequent to September
30, 2024, upon the November 25, 2024 initial public offering at per share, the true-up provision related to the at 
per share equaled shares, an increase of shares over the original shares. (See below and also Note 16). 

ASC 480 requires a financial instrument
to be classified as a liability if such financial instrument contains a conditional obligation that the issuer must or may settle by
issuing a variable number of its equity securities if, at inception, the monetary value of the obligation is predominantly based on a
known fixed monetary amount. In September 2024, under the terms of the TTS stock sale, the true-up provision for the purchase
price payment in the form of common stock was extended through the settlement of the Thinking Tree Spirits Dissenters Rights Process
(See Note 16), Once the final determination is made on the amount owed to dissenters, if any, that amount will be deducted from the true-up
amount and the resulting number of shares of common stock will be issued at the price per share of the common stock in the Company s
initial public offering (which occurred subsequent to September 30, 2024, on November 25, 2024, at per share), at which time, the
conversion price will become fixed and the purchase price will no longer qualify to be classified as a liability in accordance with ASC 480,
and will be reclassified to equity. The estimated fair value of the in estimated future contingent values (discussed also
below) is recorded as a (long term) liability until such time as their obligation for potential payment becomes established as something
more than zero and the payment number of shares is established, at which time, such future contingent payments will likewise be reclassified
from liabilities to equity in accordance with ASC 480.

The fair value of property and equipment was
estimated by applying the cost approach, which estimates fair value using replacement or reproduction cost of an asset of comparable
utility, adjusted for loss in value due to depreciation and economic obsolescence. The fair value of the contingent earn-out was estimated
using a discounted cash flow approach, which included assumptions regarding the probability-weighted cash flows of achieving certain
capacity development milestones. 

Intangible assets were determined to meet the
criterion for recognition apart from tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values of intangible assets were estimated
based on various valuation techniques including the use of discounted cash flow analyses, and multi-period excess earnings valuation
approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. These valuation inputs
included estimates and assumptions about forecasted future cash flows, long-term revenue growth rates, and discount rates. The fair value
of the customer relationships intangible asset was determined using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the excess earnings
method and will be amortized on an accelerated basis over the projected pattern of economic benefits of approximately 6 to 10 years.

Thinking Tree Spirits Dissenters 
Rights Process: In July 2024 three Thinking Tree Spirits shareholders served their notice to exercise dissenters rights under
Oregon law. Dissenters rights statutes allow a party opposed to certain transactions to demand payment in cash for the value
of their interests held rather than receive shares in the resulting entity. Parties can either agree upon a negotiated value or a
dissenter who does not believe they are being fairly compensated for the value of their interests may seek a judicially determined
value. In the case of a private entity, or a transaction involving private companies with no public clearing price for their stock,
certain methods, models and assumptions are used to attempt to estimate or derive a fair market value. The statutory deadline has
passed for any other Thinking Tree Spirits shareholders to claim dissenter s rights.

infringement claims. 

In the normal course of business, the Company
may agree to indemnify third parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors, and parties to
other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these
third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party
claims that the Company s products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other
third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability
under these indemnification obligations due to the Company s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts
and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each claim.

an aggregate of up to shares of common stock (the Common Warrants at an exercise price of per share. The
Common Warrants were sold in such private placement for a purchase price of per Common Warrant, which was equal to the price

will not have the right to exercise any portion of its Common Warrants if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially
own in excess of (or, at the election of the holder, of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to such exercise. The Company offered the Common Warrants to enable certain existing securityholders of the Company that
were expected to participate in the offering to maintain their percentage ownership interest in the Company without violating the purchaser
concentration rules of Nasdaq applicable to initial public offerings of common stock. The Common Warrants and the shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise of such warrants were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ),

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related
notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. In addition to historical consolidated financial information,
the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could
differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Unless the context otherwise requires, for the purposes
of this section, Heritage, we, us, our, or the Company refer to
Heritage Distilling Holding Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

Business Overview 

We are a craft distiller producing, marketing
and selling a diverse line of award-winning craft spirits, including whiskeys, vodkas, gins, rums, and ready-to-drink canned
cocktails. We recognize that taste and innovation are key criteria for consumer choices in spirits and innovate new products for trial
in our company-owned distilleries and tasting rooms. We believe we have developed differentiated products that are responsive to consumer
desires for rewarding and novel taste experiences. 

We compete in the craft spirits segment, which
is the most rapidly-growing segment of the overall 288 billion spirits market. According to the American Craft Spirits Association,
a craft distillery is defined generally as a distillery that produces fewer than 750,000 gallons annually and holds an ownership interest
of 51 or more of a distilled spirits plant that is licensed by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department
of the Treasury. According to the Craft Spirits Global Market Report 2023 of Grand View Research, the craft spirits segment had revenues
of more than 21.4 billion in 2023 and is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 29.4 between
2024 and 2030. We believe we are well positioned to grow more than the growth rate of the market by increasing our marketing efforts,
increasing the size of our sales teams and broadening our wholesale distribution. 

Out of the more than 2,600 craft producers
in North America, we have been recognized with more awards for our products from the American Distilling Institute, the leading independent
spirits association in the U.S., than any other North American craft distiller for each of the last ten years. Plus, numerous other
Best of Class, Double Gold and Gold medals from multiple national and international spirits competitions. We are one of the largest craft
spirits producers on the West Coast based on revenues and are developing a national reach in the U.S. through traditional sales
channels (wholesale, on-premises and e-commerce) and our unique and recently-developed Tribal Beverage Network TBN sales
channel. Based upon our revenues and our continued track record of winning industry awards in an increasingly competitive environment,
we believe we are one of the leading craft spirits producers in the United States. 

We sell our products through wholesale distribution,
directly to consumers through our five owned and operated distilleries and tasting rooms located in Washington and Oregon and by shipping
directly to consumers on-line where legal. Currently, we sell products primarily in the Pacific Northwest with limited distribution in
other states throughout the U.S. In addition, in collaboration with Native American tribes, we have recently developed a new sales,
manufacturing and distribution channel on tribal lands that we expect will increase and broaden the recognition of our brand as that
network expands nationally. 

Our growth strategy is based on three primary
areas. First, we are focused on growing our direct-to-consumer DtC sales via shipping to legal purchasers to their homes
where allowed. We currently use a three-tier compliant, third-party platform to conduct these sales and deliveries in 46 states in which
approximately 96.8 of the U.S. population reside. This allows us to develop a relationship directly with the consumer through higher-margin
sales while collecting valuable data about our best performing products. We can then use this data to target the consumer based on location,
age, key demographics and product types. With the data collected, we can also retarget and resell to them generating more revenue. 

44 

Our DtC sales also support our second growth
area, which entails growing our wholesale volume with our distributors through key national accounts both on-premises and off-premises.
By building brand recognition for key products in selected regions or states through DtC sales, we can better support the wholesale launch,
marketing and product pull-through of those products in partnership with wholesalers in those targeted states. While DtC sales result
in singular high-margin sales, growing volume through wholesale distribution is the most efficient way to drive large-scale growth across
retail chains. 

Third, we are focused on expanded growth of our
collaboration with Native American tribes through the TBN model we created. In concert with tribal partners, this sales channel includes
Heritage-branded micro production hubs, Heritage-branded stores and tasting rooms and the sale of our products and new tribally-branded
products. In the typical TBN collaboration, the tribes will own these businesses and we will receive a royalty on gross sales through
licenses we grant to use our brands, products, recipes, programs, IP, new product development, on-going compliance support and the other
support we provide. The TBN is expected to form a network of regional production hubs that will support product trials and sampling,
and will generate sales of finished, intermediate and bulk spirits depending on location, equipment and market. Importantly, because
these premium spirits will be produced locally, we believe the TBN will promote the positioning of our brands as local and regional.
We expect that, as the brands grow and the TBN footprint expands, there will be an important synergy with increased adoption and growth
through our wholesale channels in the regions where the TBN locations are driving trial and awareness. Similarly, as demand for our products
grows through our wholesale channels, there should be a positive effect on the demand for our products through the tribal distilleries. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 

Management believes that our performance and
future success depend on many factors that present significant opportunities, but also pose challenges, including the following: 

Pricing, Product Cost and Margins 

To date, most of our revenue has been generated
by retail sales of our spirits in our retail tasting rooms and through our eCommerce platform. Having completed the construction of our
existing production facilities and contracted with established distributors, we now intend to focus our production capacity, record of
success in developing award-winning products, and a portion of the net proceeds from the Company s IPO on the growth of our wholesale
channel. Going forward, we expect to sell our products in a variety of vertical industry markets in partnership with our distributors
across states and geographic regions. Pricing may vary by region due to market-specific dynamics and various layers of taxes applied
by the states at the different steps of distribution and retail sales. As a result, our financial performance will depend, in part, on
the mix of our sales in different markets during a given period and our ability to scale efficiently. 

We have experienced inflation in some of our
raw inputs, particularly in grains, bottles, cans and barrels. Some of these price increases began to moderate beginning in the second
half of 2021, such as in grain. Grain prices increased due to supply chain issues associated with the war in Ukraine and the increased
input cost of fertilizers tied to high natural gas prices. Grain prices have moderated as some additional sources of supply opened up
and the market price for grain has come down from its recent historic highs. Aluminum prices for cans and bottles increased in 2021 and
early 2022, but began to decline in the second half of 2022, and we were able to achieve more favorable pricing based on larger order
quantities in late 2022. While glass bottle prices also increased, we were able to lock in pricing for two years at favorable prices
in 2021. In 2023, our suppliers indicated their price increases were moderating and their supply chains were returning to normal. During
the uncertain periods in 2021 and 2022, we elected to take possession of glass bottle quantities designed to last two years at favorable
prices, insulating these costs to a measurable degree moving into 2024. The cost of oak barrels necessary for the aging of spirits escalated
by approximately 30 since the beginning of 2022 due to the growing demand for barrels needed to age whiskey and constraints in the raw
oak market. While constraints in the freight market caused historically high shipping rates, those shipping rates were returning to their
previous levels until the subsequent bankruptcy announcements by several freight companies in the U.S. Those bankruptcies, when
combined with high diesel prices and a lack of licensed drivers, continued to cause uncertainty in the freight markets. More recently
we have seen freight prices moderate. Likewise, employees are facing financial stress as inflation hits them at home, and their desire
for more compensation creates higher cost pressures on overall operations absent finding offsetting cost efficiencies. In addition, the
annual minimum wage increases for hourly retail and production staff in the states in which we operate are higher than other parts of
the U.S. Unlike singular commodity spikes in the recent past due to an isolated incident, or short-term supply chain issues, the
confluences of these factors created pressure across all parts of our operations, requiring us to manage each aspect carefully. Finally,
we have begun to see a change in the buying habits of consumers who are looking for experiences rather than buying things, 
and we believe consumers are electing to buy fewer but more premium items. As a result, we must re-examine how we engage with consumers
at retail and online to ensure we stay relevant. 

45 

On the positive side, there is an excess of quality
aged bourbon in Kentucky in which barrels have accumulated to never before seen levels as investors piled into the idea of owning barrels
of whiskey and bourbon to capitalize on their price appreciation. As a result of the buildup of inventory we are seeing price fall for
wholesale barrel sales, which works in our favor as we look to expand our Salute Series line of spirits. In some cases, the price for
barrels of quality aged Kentucky bourbon in bulk have fallen by more than half, reducing our input costs for our most premium products.
We view this as a tremendous arbitrage opportunity that works in our favor just as we expand our offerings under the Salute Series. 

Continued Investment and Innovation 

Our performance is dependent on our ability to
continue to develop products that resonate with consumers. It is essential that we continually identify and respond to rapidly-evolving
consumer trends, develop and introduce innovative new products, enhance our existing products, and generate consumer demand for our products.
Management believes that investment in beverage product innovation will contribute to long-term revenue growth, especially in the premium
and ultra-premium segments. 

Key Components of Results of Operations 

Net Sales 

Our net sales consist primarily of the sale of
spirits and services domestically in the United States. Customers consist primarily of wholesale distributors and direct consumers.
Substantially all revenue is recognized from products transferred at a point in time when control is transferred, and contract performance
obligations are met. Service revenue represents fees for distinct value-added services that we provide to third parties, including production,
bottling, marketing, consulting and other services, including for the TBN, aimed at growing and improving brands and sales. Service revenue
is recognized over the period in which the service is provided. 

Cost of Sales 

We recognize the cost of sales in the same manner
that the related revenue is recognized. Our cost of sales consists of product costs, including manufacturing costs, duties and other
applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs,
and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities and personnel-related expenses associated with supply chain logistics. 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

Our gross profit is the difference between our
revenues and cost of sales. Gross margin percentage is obtained by dividing gross profit by our revenue. Our gross profit and gross margin
are, or may be, influenced by several factors, including: 

Market conditions
 that may impact our pricing; 

Our cost structure
 for manufacturing operations, including contract manufacturers, relative to volume, and our
 product support obligations; 

Our capacity utilization
 and overhead cost absorption rates; 

Our ability to
 maintain our costs on the components that go into the manufacture of our products; and 

Seasonal sales offerings
 or product promotions in conjunction with plans created with our distributors or retail channels. 

We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over
time, depending on the factors described above. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily
of employee-related costs for individuals working in our sales and marketing departments, our tasting room general managers and Cask
Club directors, our hourly tasting room sales associates, the executives to whom all general managers report, and the executives whose
primary function is sales or marketing, and rent and associated costs for running each tasting room. The expenses include our personnel
responsible for managing our e-commerce platform, wages, commissions and bonuses for our outside sales team members who market and sell
our products to distributors and retail end users and the associated costs of such sales. Sales and marketing expenses also include the
costs of sports and venue sponsorships, radio, television, social media, influencers, direct mail and other traditional marketing costs,
costs related to trade shows and events and an allocated portion of overhead costs. We expect our sales and marketing costs will increase
as we expand our headcount, open new locations in partnership with tribes, expand our wholesale distribution footprint and initiate new
marketing campaigns. 

46 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily
of personnel-related expenses associated with our executive, finance, legal, insurance, information technology and human resources functions,
as well as professional fees for legal, audit, accounting and other consulting services, and an allocated portion of overhead costs.
We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as a result of operating as a public company,
including expenses necessary to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange
and related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as increased expenses for
general and director and officer insurance, investor relations, and other administrative and professional services. In addition, we expect
to incur additional costs as we hire additional personnel and enhance our infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business.
We expect that the one-time large costs associated with preparing our initial public offering will not need to be recurring expenses,
allowing us to focus on baseline costs. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding restricted stock units RSUs that, upon vesting, will settle into an aggregate of 11,064 shares based upon the grant date with a fair value of
 157.89 and 232,025 shares based upon the grant date with a fair value of 4.00. We will recognize an aggregate of 2,674,995, of previously-unrecognized
compensation expense for RSU awards upon completion of the Company s IPO. Included above are an aggregate of 232,025 RSUs to employees,
directors and consultants that the Board of Directors approved in May 2024, with a fair grant value of 4.00 per unit. These RSUs contain
a double trigger and, upon grant, were deemed to have met their time-based service requirements for vesting. They will settle on the expiration
of the lock-up agreements that were entered into in connection with the Company s IPO. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expenses include cash interest accrued
on our secured debt, cash interest and non-cash interest paid or accrued on our notes payable, interest on leased equipment or assets,
and costs and interest on credit cards. 

Change in Fair Value of Convertible Notes and Warrant Liabilities 

We elected the fair value option for the convertible
notes we issued in 2022 and 2023 (the Convertible Notes and the warrants that were issued in connection with the Convertible
Notes under ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments , with changes in fair value reported in our consolidated statements of operations
as a component of other income (expense). We believe the fair value option better reflects the underlying economics of the Convertible
Notes and the related warrants given their embedded conversion or exercise features. As a result, the Convertible Notes and the related
warrants were recorded at fair value upon issuance and were subsequently, and will continue to be, remeasured at each reporting date
until settled or converted. Accordingly, the Convertible Notes and the related warrants are recognized initially and subsequently (through
and including their exchange for common stock, or in the case of the warrants, the fixing of their exercise price) at fair value, inclusive
of their respective accrued interest at their stated interest rates, which are included in convertible notes on our consolidated balance
sheets. The changes in the fair value of the Convertible Notes and related warrants are recorded as changes in fair value 
as a component of other income (expenses) in our consolidated statements of operations. The changes in fair value related to the accrued
interest components of the Convertible Notes are also included within the single line of change in fair value of convertible notes on
our consolidated statements of operations. 

Changes in Fair Value of Investment in Flavored Bourbon, LLC

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
we had a 12.2 and 15.1 ownership interest in Flavored Bourbon, LLC, respectively, and did not record any impairment charges related
to our investment in Flavored Bourbon, LLC for the year ended December 31, 2023. In January 2024, Flavored Bourbon LLC conducted a capital
call, looking to raise 12 million from current and new investors at the same valuation as its last raise. We chose not to participate
in the raise, but still retained our rights to full recovery of our capital account of 25.3 million, with the Company being guaranteed
a pay out of this 25.3 million, which we must be paid in the event the brand is sold to a third party, or we can block such sale. As
of September 30, 2024, a total of 9,791,360 of the 12 million had been raised, with the remainder targeted to be raised by the end
of 2024. We retain a 12.2 ownership interest in this entity plus a 2.5 override in the waterfall of distributions. As a result of the
January 2024 capital call, in accordance with adjusting for observable price changes for similar investments of the same issuer pursuant
to ASC 321 as noted above, we performed a qualitative assessment of our Investment in Flavored Bourbon, LLC. On the basis of our analysis
we determined that the fair value of our Investment in Flavored Bourbon, LLC, should be adjusted to 14,285,000, with the resulting increase
in fair value of 3,421,000 recorded as gain on increase in value of Flavored Bourbon, LLC on our condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Changes in Fair Value of Convertible Notes 

As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the
Convertible Notes that were issued in 2022 and 2023 and were exchanged in October and November 2023 for a fixed number of shares of common
stock and prepaid warrants, was revalued to 18,482,353, which reflected the impact of the then-anticipated pricing of the Company s
IPO of 5.00 per share in the valuation calculation methodology, resulting in a 17,801,538 decrease in the fair value of such notes.
Upon the effectiveness of the Company s IPO, the September 30, 2024 fair value of the Convertible Notes will be reclassified from
a liability to equity in the aggregate amount of 18,482,353 (representing 15,278,168 of paid in capital from the 3,312,148 shares of
common stock and 507,394 prepaid warrants for which the Convertible Notes were exchanged multiplied by the price per share of our common
stock in the Company s IPO of 4.00 per share, with the remaining 3,204,185 will be recorded as a gain for the decrease
of the fair value of those Convertible Notes for the period from September 30, 2024 to the date of the closing of the Company s
IPO. 

As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the
convertible notes issued in 2024 and related warrant liabilities, which notes and warrants were exchanged for 2,399,090 shares of common
stock and 546,927 prepaid warrants in April 2024, was 14,283,752 and 18,658, respectively, which reflected the impact of the then-anticipated
pricing in the Company s IPO of 5.00 per share in the valuation calculation methodology. Upon the consummation of the Company s
IPO, the September 30, 2024 fair value of such convertible promissory notes and related warrant liabilities in the aggregate amount of
 14,302,410 were reclassified from a liability to equity in the aggregate amount of 14,302,410 (representing 11,784,068 of paid in
capital from the 2,399,090 shares of common stock and 546,927 prepaid warrants for which the Convertible Notes were exchanged multiplied
by the 4.00 price per share of our common stock in the Company s IPO, with the remaining 2,518,342 will be recorded
as a gain for the decrease of the fair value of those convertible notes and related warrant liabilities for the period from September
30, 2024 to the date of the closing of the Company s IPO. 

As the exchange of the Convertible Notes to common
stock was conditioned upon the closing of an initial public offering of our common stock prior to a specified date, the aggregate fair
value of the Convertible Notes were reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet until the closing of the Company s
IPO, at which time the Convertible Notes were reclassified from convertible notes payable to equity as the remaining contingency to the
exchange of the Convertible Notes to common stock had been satisfied. With the satisfaction of that remaining contingency, the exchange
of the convertible notes payable for common stock qualified for equity classification. See also Notes 5 and 16 to our unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Changes in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

We issued certain warrants for the purchase of
shares of our common stock in connection with certain Convertible Notes and classified such warrants as liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheet pursuant to ASC Topic 480 because, when issued, the warrants were to settle by issuing a variable number of shares
of our common stock based on the then-unknown price per share of our common stock in the Company s IPO. The warrant liabilities
were initially recorded at fair value on the issuance date of each warrant and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting
date. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liabilities are recognized as a component of other income (expense) in the consolidated
statements of operations. As originally drafted, changes in the fair value of the warrant liabilities are recognized until the warrants
are exercised, expire or qualify for equity classification. 

48 

In April 2024, certain of such warrants and the
related Convertible Notes were exchanged (contingent upon the consummation of our IPO) for common stock. The remaining warrants, which
remained outstanding subsequent to the closing of our IPO, were amended to fix the exercise price at 6.00 per share effective upon the
closing of our IPO, thereby removing the floating price optionality. See also Notes 5 and 16 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Income Taxes 

Our income tax provision consists of an estimate
for U.S. federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions,
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax law.

Net Sales 

Net sales were approximately 1,761,000 and 2,088,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of approximately 327,000, or 15.7 , period over
period. The decrease in net sales resulted primarily from: 

an increase in product
 sales of approximately 186,000, or 15.6 , to approximately 1,375,000 for the three months
 ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1,189,000 for the three months ended
 September 30, 2023, due mainly to the launch of the Salute Series product line in
 November 2023. 

a decrease of approximately
 512,000, or 57.1 , in services sales, to approximately 386,000 for the three months
 ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 899,000 for the three months ended
 September 30, 2023 resulting primarily from the termination of a modest third-party bottling
 contract in January 2024. 

The decision
in January 2024 to terminate the low margin production contract in favor of focusing our effort and resources on higher margin activities
is demonstrating success, as we saw our gross margin of 34 for the quarter ending September 30, 2023 increase to 35 in the quarter
ending September 30, 2024. 

The approximately 186,000 net increase in products
sales, period over period, included:

The approximately
 175,000 increase in retail products sales was primarily a result of the launch of our Salute
 Series line in November 2023 that we continued to grow through the first nine months
 of 2024. As we worked through the preparation of our initial public offering, we were cash
 constrained, limiting our ability to keep some products in stock and our ability to fully
 focus on deploying our digital marketing strategy. 

The approximately
 38,000 increase in third-party products sales was primarily a result of our production of
 bulk spirits under contract for third parties as we moved our focus to high margin activities, 

The approximately 513,000 decrease in net sales

 (513,000 

The approximately
 249,000 decrease in third-party production resulted from the ending of a modest third-party
 bottling contract as of January 31, 2024. The bulk of our revenue in this category included
 production services revenue related to a contract we had to produce a gin for a large international
 spirit brand owner; contract bottling services; and third-party barrel storage revenues.
 We expect our barrel storage revenue to continue to increase as more third-party barrels
 are put into our warehouse. We terminated our gin production contract in early January 2024
 as we shifted our focus toward applying our resources in higher-margin activities under our
 own core brands and programs and reducing risks associated with hourly labor in certain markets. 

The approximately
 9,000 decrease in retail services included Cask Club sales increasing 27,000 and Cocktail
 orders in the tasting rooms increasing 49,000, offset by Tastings decreasing 18,000. 

The approximately 255,000 decrease in Consulting and Other sales was primarily due to timing of projects and no TBN Consulting in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales were approximately 1,132,000 and
 1,372,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of approximately 240,000, or 17.5 ,
period over period. The reduction in cost of sales resulted primarily from an approximately 240,000 decrease in services cost of sales,
to approximately 14,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared approximately 222,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023.

overhead of approximately 67,000 to approximately 482,000 as of September 30, 2024 from approximately 549,000 as of September 30,
2023. A decrease in unabsorbed overhead indicates a more efficient use of facilities and equipment, helping to increase the gross margin
on each unit made. We began analyzing unabsorbed overhead as a separate component of cost of sales in 2022.

The increase in spirits-retail
 of approximately 27,000 to approximately 211,000 for the three months ended September 30,
 2024, from approximately 184,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The increase in spirits-third
 party of approximately 20,000 is due to new activity in the three months ended September
 30, 2024 and no activity for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Our unabsorbed overhead,
 which is a measure of our capacity relative to our current utilization, decreased by approximately
 67,000 to approximately 482,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
 to approximately 549,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, indicating an
 decrease in our underutilization of current production capacity, or in other words, a more
 efficient use of our resources in production. We expect that our unabsorbed overhead will
 decrease over time as our production volumes increase with increased sales, as our overhead
 expenses will be more fully allocated to increased levels of production. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit was approximately 630,000 and 716,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of approximately 86,000, or 12 , period over period,

Gross margin was
 approximately 35.8 and 34.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based upon total net sales
 of approximately 1,761,000 and 2,088,000, respectively. As we add more Salute Series sales via online channels, we expect
 to see our overall gross margin increase. Likewise, as we add more states into our wholesale distribution channel focused solely on
 high-margin items, rather than any low-margin well vodka in those states, we expect to see additional margin increases. Also, as we
 add more cases of production through our system, we expect the unabsorbed overhead costs will be reduced as each additive case of
 new sales volume begins to carry incremental overhead costs as part of the normal manufacturing cost accounting, which should
 increase our overall margins. Finally, our third-party production contracts were very low margin for us, which is why management
 made the decision to end those contracts at the end of January 2024. Moving forward, management is focusing on higher-margin
 activities, which we expect will increase our overall margins.

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses were approximately
 1,271,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 1,470,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. This approximately 199,000 decrease included:

The approximately
 17,000 decrease in personnel expense was primarily a result of a decrease of two full-time
 marketing and retail administration staff in May 2023. 

The approximately
 30,000 increase in leases and rentals expenses was primarily due to; the opening of our
 Thinking Tree retail location in April 2024, eCommerce space no longer needed due to outsourcing
 and moved to G A, Adjustment in 2023 for Ballard, Washington retail location closing. 

The approximately
 210,000 decrease in sales and marketing expenses included: an increase in digital advertising
 production expense, which was offset by decreases in sponsorships and print advertising as
 we shifted to a new third-party e-commerce platform; two large sports sponsorships that were
 put under contract before COVID-19 shutdowns went into effect, which contracts were reinstated
 in 2022 and 2023, could not be cancelled and are not being renewed for 2024 or beyond. 

We note
the gross profits during the period ended September 30, 2024 was lower by just 86,000 compared to the same period ending Septebmer 30,
2023, even though our sales and marketing expenses were lower by 199,000 for the 2024 period versus the same period in 2023. This indicates
we are getting more efficient at driving high quality revenue while being conscious of the costs associated with marketing and selling
those goods. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were approximately
 1,439,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1,303,000 for the three months ended September

The approximately
 47,000 decrease in leases and rentals was primarily the result of our Ballard lease terminating
 April 2024. 

The approximately

 credits for closed tasting room, Capitol Hill (Seattle), in July 2023, travel, insurance
 and other expenses.

A majority of our
 professional fees expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were
 incurred as a result of general preparedness of our financial reporting and capital structure
 for an SEC filing event, including for our IPO. Accordingly, within that context, most
 of our professional fees expense and changes in expense levels between the respective year-over-year
 periods were as follows: 

The approximately 57,000 increase in accounting and valuation
services expenses included an increase in auditing services and valuations completed within three months ended September 30, 2024. 

The approximately 27,000 decrease in legal fees was primarily
the result of less legal work in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to legal work in the three months ended
September 30, 2023 related to work associated with the preparation of related filings with the SEC. 

The approximately 60,000 increase in other professional fees
was primarily the result of outsourcing human resources and payroll transition and public relations work during the three months ended
September 30, 2024. 

54 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased by approximately 25,000
to approximately 662,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 687,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was partly due to PPP loan, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense of
 6,000 was accrued on the PPP loan, while 80,000 accrual was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is offset
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest 59,000 were accrued on Factoring Agreements and subsequently converted to Preferred
Stock in July and September 2024, which were classified as an interest expense. 

Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial, primarily as we were in a net loss position for those periods. 

Comparison of the Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended

Net Sales 

Net sales were approximately 5,310,000 and 5,525,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of approximately 215,000, or 3.9 , period over
period, the bulk of which decrease was in the quarter period ending September 30. 2024 as we managed through several out of stock issues
on key products. The decrease in net sales resulted primarily from: 

an increase in
 product sales of approximately 678,000, or 20.1 , to approximately 4,051,000 for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 3,373,000 for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2023, due mainly to the launch of the Salute Series
 product line in November 2023. This increase would have been greater except for the closure
 of our Ballard, Washington retail location in late March 2023, which generated a full quarter of retail tasting room revenue in 2023, while the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included none of that revenue. 

a decrease of
 approximately 894,000, or 41.5 , in services sales, to approximately 1,259,000 for the
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 2,152,000 for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2023 resulting primarily from the termination of a third-party bottling
 contract in January 2024, which we strategically terminated so that we could focus on higher
 margin activities. 

We note that total sales for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 would have been higher than total sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 had we not closed our
Ballard, Washington tasting room in March of 2023 in connection with our decision not to renew the lease for that facility and if we
have chosen to keep the low margin third party production contract in place rather than terminate it in January 2024. We believe this
demonstrates that 2023 and 2024 were periods of stabilization in anticipation of new product launches and new markets to begin our growth
after the conclusion of our initial public offering. 

The approximately 678,000 net increase in products
sales, period over period, included:

 while the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included none of that revenue. 

The approximately
 2,000 decrease in third-party products sales was primarily a result of reducing the production
 of low margin bulk spirits under contract for third parties.

The approximately
 690,000 decrease in third-party production resulted from the ending of a low margin third-party
 bottling contract as of January 31, 2024. The bulk of our revenue in this category included
 production services revenue related to a contract we had to produce a gin for a large international
 spirit brand owner; contract bottling services; and third-party barrel storage revenues.
 We expect our barrel storage revenue to continue to increase as more third-party barrels
 are put into our warehouse. We terminated our gin production contract in early January 2024
 as we shifted our focus toward applying our resources in higher-margin activities under our
 own core brands and programs and reducing risks associated with hourly labor in certain markets. 

The approximately
 53,000 increase in retail services sales included Cask Club sales increasing by approximately
 27,000 and Cocktail orders in the tasting rooms increasing by approximately 49,000, offset
 by sales of Tastings decreasing by approximately 18,000.

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales were approximately 3,524,000 and
 4,135,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of approximately 611,000, or 14.8 ,
period over period. The reduction in cost of sales resulted primarily from an approximately 580,000 decrease in services cost of sales,
to approximately 95,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared approximately 675,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023.

The larger realized
 increase in third-party production costs indicates low margins on those efforts, which is
 the principal reason why management is moving us away from those efforts starting in 2024
 as we execute on our plan to open more TBN locations and look to realize significant gains
 in both topline revenue and high-margin DtC sales of our Salute Series line and expanded wholesale distribution of our core products in key states. Management
 is also working with our wholesale sales team to move us out of the low-margin well vodka
 business in favor of higher-margin premium whiskey products. 

The approximately
 46,000 in one-time aggregate hand sanitizer cost of sales for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2023 was due to a vendor invoice from 2020 that we did not receive until early
 2023 when the vendor audited its billings for prior years. There was no similar expense
 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we do not anticipate any future expenses
 associated with hand sanitizer moving forward. 

Our unabsorbed
 overhead, which is a measure of our capacity relative to our current utilization, increased
 by approximately 105,000 to approximately 1,654,000 for the nine months ended September
 30, 2024 compared to approximately 1,549,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
 2023, indicating an increase in our underutilization of current production capacity. This
 was driven by out of stock issues, meaning our equipment was not being used as much this
 year versus the period year as we worked through those stocking items as we progressed towards
 our initial public offering. We expect that our unabsorbed overhead will decrease over time
 as our production volumes increase with increased sales, as our overhead expenses will be
 more fully allocated to increased levels of production. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit was approximately 1,786,000 and
 1,390,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of approximately 396,000, or 28 , period

Gross margin was

 respectively, based upon total net sales of approximately 5,310,000 and 5,525,000, respectively.
 As we add more Salute Series sales via online channels, we expect to see
 our overall gross margin increase. Likewise, as we add more states into our wholesale distribution
 channel focused solely on high-margin items, rather than any low-margin well vodka in those
 states, we expect to see additional margin increases. Also, as we add more cases of production
 through our system, we expect the unabsorbed overhead costs will be reduced as each additive
 case of new sales volume begins to carry incremental overhead costs as part of the normal
 manufacturing cost accounting, which should increase our overall margins. Finally, our third-party
 production contracts were very low margin for us, which is why management made the decision
 to end those contracts at the end of January 2024. Moving forward, management will focus
 on higher-margin activities, which we expect will increase our overall margins.

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses were approximately 3,760,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 4,563,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This approximately

The approximately
 447,000 decrease in personnel expense was primarily a result of a decrease of five full-time
 marketing and retail administration staff in May 2023. 

The approximately
 8,000 decrease in leases and rentals expenses was primarily due to the closure of our Ballard,
 Washington retail location in March 2023. 

The approximately
 454,000 decrease in sales and marketing expenses included: an increase in digital advertising
 production expense, which was offset by decreases in sponsorships and print advertising as
 we shifted to a new third-party e-commerce platform; two large sports sponsorships that were
 put under contract before COVID-19 shutdowns went into effect, which contracts were reinstated
 in 2022 and 2023, could not be cancelled and are not being renewed for 2024 or beyond. 

The approximately
 91,000 increase in other sales and marketing expenses included increases in: professional
 fees for contracted Chief Revenue Officer services and e-commerce distribution services and
 travel; software for an improved point-of-sale software upgrade; location utilities and insurance;
 and a net increase in other sales and marketing expenses. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were approximately
 4,632,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 6,003,000 for the nine months ended September

The approximately
 122,000 increase in personnel expense was primarily a result of increasing staff 1 executive
 officer in March 2024 and rate increases to executive officers. 

The approximately
 141,000 decrease in recruiting and retention expenses included recruiting expenses related
 to hiring a Senior VP of Sales in the first quarter of 2023 and expense related to hiring
 a Chief Financial Officer in the second quarter of 2023. 

The approximately
 37,000 decrease in leases and rentals was primarily the result of our Capitol Hill lease
 terminating May 2023. This decrease was offset by; our Ballard tasting room closing, resulting
 in our move of lease cost from the retail and marketing category to G A expenses beginning
 in April 2023 and then this lease terminating April 2024, also a portion of our warehouse
 location was moved from retail and marketing category to G A expenses beginning May 2023. 

The approximately
 119,000 decrease in depreciation expense was primarily the result of accelerating depreciation
 in 2023 to write off the remaining assets of our Ballard tasting room, which was closed in
 March 2023. 

The approximately
 228,000 decrease in other general and administrative expenses included accumulative smaller
 changes in utilities, travel, insurance and other expenses.

A majority of
 our professional fees expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were
 incurred as a result of general preparedness of our financial reporting and capital structure
 for an SEC filing event, including for the Company s IPO, and previously, for the proposed
 SPAC transaction discussed below (which was terminated in May 2023). Accordingly,
 within that context, most of our professional fees expense and changes in expense levels
 between the respective year-over-year periods were as follows: 

The
 approximately 855,000 decrease in accounting and valuation services expenses to approximately
 381,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 1,236,000
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included: a decrease of approximately 645,000
 in professional fees for financial statement preparation and review expenses; an additional
 approximately 104,000 decrease related to the SPAC transaction; approximately 40,000 for
 contract chief financial officer services that ended in April 2023 and a decrease in general
 accounting and financial services of approximately 66,000. 

The approximately
 390,000 decrease in legal fees was primarily the result of legal work in the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024 related to our IPO (that were not otherwise deferred and subsequently
 capitalized) and general corporate purposes; compared to legal work in the nine months
 ended September 30, 2023 related to the merger agreement for the proposed SPAC transaction,
 work associated with the preparation of related filings with the SEC, and general corporate
 purposes. 

The approximately
 276,000 increase in other professional fees was primarily the result of the 180,000 media
 expense catch up in June 30, 2024 that was previously in deferred. 

Beginning in 2022, we began exploring funding
options, including preparations for the possible merger into a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). While the costs directly associated
with this activity were capitalized and deferred to the balance sheet to be recognized as a cost of the transaction upon a successful
completion or other disposition, we also incurred certain other expenses related to preparing for the transaction that did not directly
qualify for capitalization and deferral, such as the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements, and certain expenses for
valuation and other financial services. In May 2023, we abandoned work on the proposed SPAC transaction, and as of December 31,
2023, we expensed the approximately 424,000 of related costs that had previously been capitalized and deferred to the balance sheet.

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased by approximately 4,000
to approximately 1,897,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1,893,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was partly due to a loan agent fee for Silverwood of 25,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, while no such fee was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
interest expense of 1 (or 17,000) was accrued on the PPP loan, while no such accrual was recorded for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest and fees totaling 70,000 were accrued on Factoring Agreements and subsequently
converted to Preferred Stock in July and September 2024, which were classified as an interest expense. 

Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial, primarily as we were in a net loss position for those periods. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our consolidated financial statements,
which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand
and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures
used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not
be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin: Adjusted
gross profit represents GAAP gross profit adjusted for any nonrecurring gains and losses. Adjusted gross margin represents Adjusted gross
profit as a percentage of total net sales. We use these measures (i) to compare operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) for
planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget, and (iii) to evaluate the performance and
effectiveness of operational strategies. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: EBITDA
represents GAAP net loss adjusted for (i) depreciation of property and equipment; (ii) interest expense; and (iii) provision
for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for nonrecurring gains and losses. We believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA
help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we include in GAAP
operating loss. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information
prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are several limitations related to the use of this non-GAAP financial measure compared to
the closest comparable GAAP measure. Some of these limitations are that: 

Adjusted gross
 profit, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements
 for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted gross
 profit, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our
 working capital needs; 

Adjusted gross
 profit, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA exclude certain recurring, non-cash charges such as depreciation

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have prepared our financial statements assuming
we will continue as a going concern. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and experienced negative cash flows from operations
as we have invested in equipment, location buildout, inventory buildout (including laying down barrels of whiskey for aging) and marketing
to grow our presence and brands. To date, our primary sources of capital have been private placements of equity securities, term loans,
and convertible debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net income and (loss) of approximately
 5,426,000 and (31,642,000), respectively (of which, approximately 10,058,000 and (20,577,000), respectively, stemmed from the decrease/(increase)
in fair value of certain convertible notes, warrants and contingencies). We expect to incur additional losses and higher operating expenses
for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in inventory and the growth of our business. 

At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding aged
payables to vendors in the aggregate amount of approximately 5,632,000, inclusive of accrued amounts to service providers who were,
or are, providing services for us related to our IPO. We have reached agreements with most of these aged vendors, including the vendors
with the largest outstanding invoices, to pay such payables upon the closing of our IPO or periodically on payment dates following the
closing of our IPO. Of the aforementioned vendor obligations, approximately 834,000 are for services related to the preparation of our
IPO. Most of the remaining payables relate to services that were agreed upon or contracted for prior to the COVID-19 lockdowns, but were
put on hold or held over during those lockdowns and then restarted after the COVID lockdowns ended pursuant to the terms of the agreements.
Many of those contracts have been completed and will not renew or be renewed, and we expect to make payments to those vendors in a way
that allows us to manage our cash on hand as we grow our higher-margin revenue in 2025. Given our shift away from low-margin products
and services, management believes the use of cash for higher-margin activities and priorities, requiring fewer raw goods units to drive
more top line revenue, and more profitable revenue, will also assist with reducing and eventually eliminating our cash burn. While we
believe we have put in place satisfactory payment terms for the payment of our outstanding payables, there is a risk that one or more
of our vendors could demand a more immediate payment or initiate litigation against us in an attempt to force payment of the amounts
owed. In such a case, the litigation could cause us to incur significant costs defending such action, and any such payment could materially
affect our business, financial condition or liquidity. 

62 

From time to time, we have been out of compliance
with various financial and other debt covenants under the Silverview Loan, which is discussed below, with respect to our failure to meet
certain financial thresholds and tests and the furnishing of some of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,
2023 and 2022. As of October 1, 2024, the lender waived any existing covenant compliance matters as of December 31, 2023 and 2022
and agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the loan agreement for any covenant violations, defaults or breaches
through the Silverview Loan reporting period ending September 30, 2024. During the first six months of 2024, we were out of compliance
with certain debt covenants in connection with the furnishing of monthly income statements, meeting an EBITDA test, providing a monthly
cash balance report, and providing a monthly operational performance report, of which those covenant breaches were also waived in the
October 1, 2024 Silverview Loan modification. On October 1, 2024, we executed an agreement with our lender, which was further modified
on November 19, 2024, that went into effect upon the closing of our IPO and, among other changes favorable to us, waived any past defaults
and covenant breaches and simplified our financial tests and reporting requirements under the loan agreement, making it easier for us
to remain in compliance as we focus on growing our business. We used a portion of the net proceeds of our IPO to repay a portion of the
principal amount of the Silverview Loan. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors. 

We believe the net proceeds from our IPO, together
with our cash generated from our sales and services, will enable us to fund our operations, including our near-term expansion plans,
into at least the third quarter of 2025. However, we will continue seeking additional financing from time to time to meet our working
capital requirements, make continued investment in research and development and make capital expenditures needed for us to maintain and
expand our business. We do not have any credit facilities as a source of future funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be
able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms
favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it,
or if we expend capital on projects that are not successful, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to
business challenges could be significantly limited, or we may have to cease our operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible
debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights,
preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. 

Line of Credit and Debt Agreements 

In March 2021, we entered into a secured term
loan agreement with Silverview Credit Partners, L.P. (the Silverview Loan for a secured term loan of up to 15,000,000.
The Silverview Loan originally matured on April 15, 2025, but was extended to October 25, 2026 in the October 1, 2024 Silverview
Loan modification. The Silverview Loan initially accrued interest through the 18-month anniversary of the closing date at (i) a
fixed rate of 10.0 per annum, which portion was payable in cash, and (ii) a fixed rate of 6.5 per annum, which portion was payable
in kind and added to the outstanding obligations as principal. Commencing in October 2022, the Silverview Loan began accruing interest
at a fixed rate of 15.0 per annum through maturity. We had an option to prepay the Silverview Loan with a prepayment premium up to 30.0 
of the outstanding obligations during the first 24 months of the loan, after which time we could prepay the loan with no premium
due. We are now past that initial 24-month window and can prepay all or some of the outstanding balance without penalty. The Silverview
Loan is secured by substantially all of our assets. 

The original Silverview Loan contained certain
financial and other debt covenants that, among other things, imposed certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments and capital
expenditures. The financial covenants required that, at the end of each applicable fiscal period, as defined pursuant to the Silverview
Loan agreement, we either had (i) an EBITDA interest coverage ratio up to 2.00 to 1.00, or (ii) a cash interest coverage ratio
of not less than 1.25 to 1.00. Commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, we were required to maintain liquidity of
not less than 500,000. The Silverview Loan was used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures.
The covenants and tests have since been deleted as part of the October 1, 2024 and November 19, 2024 loan modifications. 

63 

As discussed above, in the past, we have violated
various financial and other debt covenants regarding our failure to comply with the financial covenants and to timely furnish our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. As the chance of meeting the same or more restrictive covenants at subsequent
compliance measurement dates within the following year was remote, we determined that the Silverview Loan should be classified as a current
liability as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding balance of the Silverview
Loan was 12,250,000. The lender had previously agreed to waive any existing covenant compliance matters as of December 31, 2022
and to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the loan agreement through December 31, 2023. In June 2024, we reached
an agreement in principal to modify the Silverview Loan in the following ways. The modification, which was executed by the parties on
October 1, 2024, and was further modified on November 19, 2024, and went into effect upon the closing of our IPO: 

1) extended the maturity
 date by 18 months to October 25, 2026; 

2) recast the amortization
 schedule to reduce the amount paid each quarter to allow us to preserve cash, as follows:
 974,729 due December 25, 2024, 700,000 due June 30, 2025 and then 500,000 due every six
 months thereafter; 

3) increased the per annum
 interest rate from 15 to 16.5 commencing in December 2024, with monthly interest payments
 remaining in effect but allowing us at our election to pay 100 of each interest payment
 in cash or to pay approximately 73.7 of such interest payment in cash and to add the balance
 of such interest payment to the principal amount of the loan through the end of December
 2025; 

4) waived any breach relating
 to past missed amortization or interest payments; 

5) waived any breach relating
 to any past covenant defaults; 

6) added a 1 additional
 exit fee due at loan payoff; 

7) added an additional
 1 exit fee due at payoff if we do not refinance or repay the entire loan by the original
 July 30, 2025 maturity date; 

8) eliminated the EBITDA
 coverage and interest coverage ratio tests; and 

9) reduced and simplified
 the reporting requirements to match the reporting we must make to the SEC as a public company. 

With these changes and the net proceeds we receive from our IPO, we
expect to remain in compliance with all financial covenants in the loan agreement. We used approximately 600,000 of the net proceeds
of the Company s IPO to repay a portion of the principal amount of the Silverview Loan. 

In April 2020, we were granted a loan under
the Paycheck Protection Program PPP offered by the Small Business Administration (the SBA under the Coronavirus
Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ), section 7(a)(36) of the Small Business Act for 3,776,100.
The proceeds from the PPP loan could only be used to retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage interest, lease and utility
payments and all or a portion of the loan could be forgiven if the proceeds are used in accordance with the terms of the program within
the eight or 24-week measurement period. The loan terms required the principal balance and 1 interest to be paid back within two years
of the date of the note. In June 2021, our bank approved forgiveness of the loan of 3,776,100. During the year ended of December 31,
2021, the forgiveness was partially rescinded by the SBA and we recognized 1,506,644 as other income in the consolidated statements
of operations, resulting in 2,269,456 in debt. Under the terms of the PPP loan, we have also recorded interest on the PPP loan at the
rate of 1 , for a total of 101,535 as of September 30, 2024. We are currently in the process of disputing a portion if not all of the
difference. The terms of the agreement state that we have 18-24 months to repay the PPP loan. Following the date of the forgiveness,
the remaining balance of the PPP loan of 2,269,456 is expected to be repaid in the next 12 months with our general assets. 

64 

In January 2022, we entered into an unsecured
business loan and security agreement with Channel Partners Capital, LLC (the 2022 Channel Partners Loan for an aggregate
borrowing capacity of 250,000. The Channel Partners Loan matured on June 26, 2023 and accrued interest at a fixed rate of 13.982 .
Principal of 16,528 plus interest is payable monthly. We had an option to prepay the Channel Partners Loan with a prepayment discount
of 5.0 . As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the 2022 Channel Partners Loan was 0 (having
been paid off in April 2023). In April 2023, we entered into a new secured business loan and security agreement with Channel Partners
Capital, LLC (the 2023 Channel Partners Loan for an aggregate borrowing capacity of 250,000, of which 47,104 of proceeds
were used to pay off the 2022 Channel Partners Loan. The 2023 Channel Partners Loan will mature on October 5, 2024 and accrues interest
at a fixed rate of 13.34 per annum. A principal payment of 16,944 plus interest is payable monthly. We have an option to prepay the
2023 Channel Partners Loan with a prepayment discount of 5.0 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance
of the 2023 Channel Partners Loan was 16,569 and 149,824, respectively. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we paid the remaining balance
due under the 2023 Channel Partners Loan in October 2024.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We had no obligations, assets or liabilities
that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 or for the periods presented. We do not participate
in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased
any non-financial assets. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements
is included in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations
in interest rates, which may adversely affect the results of operations and our financial condition. We seek to minimize these risks
through regular operating and financing activities. 

Inflation Risk 

We do not believe that inflation had a significant
impact on our results of operations for any periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. Nonetheless, if our costs were
to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs, and our inability or failure
to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and
expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on
historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

While our significant accounting policies are
described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are
those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Valuation of Convertible Notes 

The fair value of the convertible notes at issuance
and at each reporting period is estimated based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement
within the fair value hierarchy. We use a probability weighted expected return method PWERM and the Discounted Cash Flow DCF method to incorporate estimates and assumptions concerning our prospects and market indications into a model to estimate
the value of the notes. The most significant estimates and assumptions used as inputs in the PWERM and DCF valuation techniques impacting
the fair value of the convertible notes are the timing and probability of an initial public offering, de-SPAC Merger, held to maturity,
and default scenario outcomes. 

Specifically, we discounted the cash flows for fixed payments that were not sensitive to our equity value
by using annualized discount rates that were applied across valuation dates from issuance dates of the convertible notes to each reporting
period. The discount rates were based on certain considerations including time to payment, an assessment of our credit position, market
yields of companies with similar credit risk at the date of valuation estimation, and calibrated rates based on the fair value relative
to the original issue price from the convertible notes. 

67 

Valuation of Warrant Liabilities 

The fair value of the warrant liabilities at
issuance and at each reporting period are estimated based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level
3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The warrants are free-standing instruments and determined to be liability-classified in
accordance with ASC 480. We use the PWERM and the Monte Carlo Simulation MCS to incorporate estimates and assumptions
concerning our prospects and market indications into the models to estimate the value of the warrants. The most significant estimates
and assumptions used as inputs in the PWERM and MCS valuation techniques impacting the fair value of the warrant liabilities are the
timing and probability of an initial public offering, de-SPAC Merger, held to maturity, and default scenario outcomes. The most significant
estimates and assumptions used as inputs in the PWERM and MCS valuation techniques impacting the fair value of the warrant liabilities
are those utilizing certain weighted average assumptions such as expected stock price volatility, expected term of the warrants, and
risk-free interest rates. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

All long-lived assets used are evaluated for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider
in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant
negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. When such an event occurs,
future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated. If the undiscounted expected
future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the asset s
fair value and its carrying value. We did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth
company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable
to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition
period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until
the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the
extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards
as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, and our financial statements may not be comparable to other public
companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We may choose to early adopt
any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies. 

We will cease to be an emerging growth company
on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion
or more, (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our IPO, (iii) the
date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (iv) the
date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 

Further, even after we no longer qualify as an
emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to take advantage of
many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in
our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely
on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for
our common stock and our share price may be more volatile. 

68 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company ,
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on management s evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The material weaknesses,
which relate to internal control over financial reporting, that were identified are: 

a).
Due to our small size, we do not have a proper segregation of duties in certain areas of our financial reporting process. The areas where
we have a lack of segregation of duties include cash receipts and disbursements, approval of purchases and approval of accounts payable
invoices for payment. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements
of the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis; 

b).
we do not have any formally adopted internal controls surrounding our cash and financial reporting procedures; and, 

c). the lack of the quantity of resources to implement
an appropriate level of review controls to properly evaluate the completeness and accuracy of transactions entered into by our company. 

We are committed to improving our financial organization.
In addition, we will look to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function to resolve
non-routine or complex accounting matters. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become involved in
various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of
any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, or operating results. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company, 
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

We received gross proceeds of approximately 6.75 million from our initial public offering, before deducting underwriting discounts and
