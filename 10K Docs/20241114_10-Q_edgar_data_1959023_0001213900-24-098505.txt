ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Introduction
and Certain Cautionary Statements 

As
used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context requires otherwise, references to the Company, SG
DevCo, we, us, and our refer to Safe and Green Development Corporation and its subsidiaries.
The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and schedules included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and with our audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in
our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024 (the 2023
10-K ). This discussion, particularly information with respect to our future operations, includes forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading Special Note regarding forward-looking statements in this
Quarterly Report on Form10-Q. You should review the disclosure under the heading Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q and the 2023 10-K for a discussion for important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

Special
Note regarding forward-looking statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. The statements contained in this report that are not purely historical
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q may use forward-looking terminology, such as anticipates, believes, could, 
 would, estimates, may, might, plan, expect, intend, 
 should, will, or other variations on these terms or their negatives. All statements other than statements
of historical facts are statements that could potentially be forward-looking. We caution that forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements or
could affect the extent to which a particular objective, projection, estimate or prediction is realized. 

Forward-looking
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such
forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: 

Our limited operating history
 makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects. 

Our auditors have expressed
 substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our financial condition
 and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth or investments effectively. 

The long-term sustainability
 of our operations as well as future growth depends in part upon our ability to acquire land parcels suitable for residential projects
 at reasonable prices. 

We operate in a highly
 competitive market for investment opportunities, and we may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of real property assets. 

Our property portfolio
 has a high concentration of properties located in certain states. 

There can be no assurance
 that the properties in our development pipeline will be completed in accordance with the anticipated timing or cost. 

Our insurance coverage
 on our properties may be inadequate to cover any losses we may incur and our insurance costs may increase. 

Our operating results may
 be negatively affected by potential development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks. 

27 

We rely on third-party suppliers
 and long supply chains, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or
 if there is a significant interruption in our supply chains, our ability to timely and efficiently access raw materials that meet
 our standards for quality could be adversely affected. 

Previously undetected environmentally
 hazardous conditions may adversely affect our business. 

Legislative, regulatory,
 accounting or tax rules, and any changes to them or actions brought to enforce them, could adversely affect us. 

If we were deemed to be
 an investment company, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could
 have an adverse effect on our business. 

Our industry is cyclical
 and adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could reduce the demand for housing and, as a result, could have a material
 adverse effect on us. 

Fluctuations in real estate
 values may require us to write-down the book value of our real estate assets. 

We could be impacted by
 our investments through joint ventures, which involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole owner. 

We may not be able to sell
 our real property assets when we desire. 

Access to financing sources
 may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to maximize our returns. 

If we were to default in
 our obligation to repay the loan we received from BCV S G DevCorp or Peak One, it could disrupt or adversely affect our business
 and our stock price could decline. 

Future outbreaks of any
 highly infectious or contagious diseases, could materially and adversely impact our performance, financial condition, results of
 operations and cash flows. 

SG Holdings beneficially
 owns a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, and it may therefore be able to substantially control our management
 and affairs. 

We currently do not intend
 to pay dividends on our common stock. Consequently, our stockholders ability to achieve a return on their investment will
 depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock. 

We may issue shares of
 preferred or common stock in the future, which could dilute your percentage ownership of the company. 

If securities or industry
 analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume
 could decline 

Provisions in our corporate
 charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our
 stockholders to replace or remove our management. 

If securities or industry
 analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume
 could decline 

Our failure to comply with
 continued listing requirements of Nasdaq. 

Risks relating to ownership
 of our common stock, including high volatility and dilution. 

28 

The
risks and uncertainties included here are not exhaustive or necessarily in order of importance. Other sections of this report and other
reports we file with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our business and financial performance, including discussed
in Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as the Risk Factors set forth in
our 2023 10-K. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. 

In
addition, certain information presented below is based on unaudited financial information. There can be no assurance that there will
be no changes to this information once audited financial information is available. As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. We will not undertake to
update any forward-looking statement herein or that may be made from time to time on behalf of us. 

Overview 

We were formed in 2021 by Safe Green Holdings
Corp. SG Holdings for the purpose of real property development utilizing SG Holdings proprietary technologies and
SG Holdings manufacturing facilities. Our current business focus is primarily on the direct acquisition and indirect investment
in properties nationally that will be further developed in the future into green single or multi-family projects. We are focused on increasing
our presence in markets with favorable job formation and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily and/or single-family housing.
Our business model is flexible and we anticipate developing properties on our own and also through joint ventures in which we partner
with third-party equity investors or other developers. To date, we have generated minimal revenue and our activities have consisted mostly
of the acquisition and entitlement of three properties, an investment in two entities that have acquired two properties to be further
developed, entered into three joint ventures with the intention of developing properties in the Texas market and have invested in real-estate
related AI assets and entities, as further described below. 

We intend to develop the properties that we own
and invest in from the proceeds of sales of our securities and future financings, both at the corporate and project level, and/or sale
proceeds from properties that are sold. However, our ability to develop any properties will be subject to our ability to raise capital
either through the sale of equity or by incurring debt. 

In January 2024, we announced that we would strategically
look to monetize our real estate holdings throughout 2024 by identifying markets where our land may have increased in value, as demonstrated
by third-party appraisals. In connection with this strategy, we have entered into agreements to sell our St. Mary s site and our
Lago Vista site. Additionally, we expect to subdivide our McLean property into buildable single family lots that can subsequently be sold
to developers or developed internally. 

Recently, we have entered two joint ventures with
Milk Honey LLC , Sugar Phase I LLC and Hacienda Olivia Phase II LLC, with the intention of developing green single-family homes
in the Southern Texas market. To date, we have started construction on five single family homes in the Sugar Phase joint venture. The
homes are expected to be delivered by the first quarter of 2025. We are currently developing 57 single family lots through our Hacienda
Olivia joint venture and expect to begin vertical construction on those lots in the second quarter of 2025. We have also entered into
a joint venture named Pulga Internacional with the intention of developing an eco-friendly commercial retail outlet. 

29 

Additionally, we acquired a majority interest
in Majestic World Holdings LLC MWH during the first quarter of 2024. MWH is a prop-tech company that has created an AI
Software platform (the AI Powered Platform ). The AI Powered Platform, which was launched in April 2024, aims to decentralize
the real estate marketplace, creating an all-in-one solution that brings banks, institutions, home builders, clients, agents, vendors,
gig workers, and insurers into a seamlessly integrated and structured AI-driven environment. In addition, we purchased all of the assets
related to the A.I technology known as My Virtual Online Intelligent Assistant MyVONIA ). MyVONIA, an advanced artificial
intelligence (AI) assistant, utilizes machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to provide users with human-like conversational
interactions, tailored to their specific needs to help simplify daily tasks and improve productivity for individuals and businesses. 

During
the third quarter of 2024, we have generated minimal revenue and our primary source of funding has been from sales of debt and equity
described in more detail below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have generated limited revenue and have
incurred significant net losses in each year since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended
December 31, 2023 we incurred a net loss of 7,378,464 and 4,200,541, respectively. We expect to incur increasing losses in the
future when we commence development of our McLean Property. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 13,707
and 3,236, respectively. Prior to us becoming a public company, our operations were primarily funded through advances from SG
Holdings and we had been largely dependent upon SG Holdings for funding. We have recently funded our operations through bridge note
financing, project level financing, and the issuance of our equity and debt securities. We intend to develop the properties that we
own from the proceeds of sales of our securities to Arena Investors LP and future financings, both at the corporate and project
level, and/or sale proceeds from properties that are sold. Additional financing will be required to continue operations, which
may not be available at acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding when it becomes necessary, we
would likely be forced to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our operating activities, including selling some of our
properties. There is no guarantee we will be successful in raising capital outside of our current sources, we also
have amounts owed to us from SG Holdings for advances we made to them in the amount of 1,720,844, the collectability of which is
uncertain. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements have been prepared using
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). In connection with the preparation of the
financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience,
current trends, and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time the financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis,
we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly
and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could
differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules
and forms and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-1I). Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13-15(e), were ineffective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During the fiscal quarter ended September 30,
2024, other than the material weakness discussed below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Material Weakness 

During the course of the review of the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we identified a material weakness in our controls relating to the ineffective
design of certain management review controls across a portion of the Company s financial statements. Specifically, the controls
related to the review of internal and externally prepared reports and analysis utilized in the financial reporting process of outside
consultants that aid in the preparation of our financial statements. 

In order to remediate these material weaknesses,
we added four more external consultants to assist in the preparation of our financial statements. 

We are committed to maintaining a strong internal
control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses
are remediated as soon as possible. 

Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described
above, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity
with GAAP. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will
prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud
will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The
design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration
in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 

The information included in Note 11 -
Commitments and Contingencies of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report Form
10-Q is incorporated by reference into this Item. 

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 

Except as set forth below, there have been no
material changes in our risk factors from the risks previously reported in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K.
You should carefully consider the factors discussed in Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future
results. The risks described in our Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to
us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating
results. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Our auditors have expressed substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We have generated limited revenue and have incurred
significant net losses in each year since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 7,378,464
as compared to a net loss of 2,615,965 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect to incur increasing losses in the future
when we commence development of our McLean Property. We cannot offer any assurance as to our future financial results. Also, we cannot
provide any assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding from public or private offerings on terms acceptable to us, or
at all, if, and when needed. In addition, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to collect amounts owed to us from SG Holdings
and have taken a reserve against the 1,720,844 owed to us by SG Holdings, which is included in additional paid-in capital. Our inability
to achieve profitability from our current operating plans or to raise capital to cover any potential shortfall would have a material adverse
effect on our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. If we are not able to secure additional funding, if, and when needed,
we would be forced to curtail our operations or take other action in order to continue to operate. A significant portion of our funding
was historically provided by SG Holdings. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
If we are unable to meet our obligations and are forced to curtail or cease our business operations, our stockholders could suffer a complete
loss of any investment made in our securities. 

We identified a
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective
as of June 30, 2024. In the future, we may identify additional material weaknesses or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of
internal control over financial reporting or adequate disclosure controls and procedures, which may result in material errors in our financial
statements or cause us to fail to meet our period reporting obligations. 

Management and our Audit
Committee, in consultation with M K CPAS PLLC M K , our independent
registered public accounting firm, determined that there was a material weakness in our internal controls as of September 30, 2024. A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

Pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting
are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Annually, we perform activities that include reviewing,
documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal
control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control
environment, we could suffer misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely
cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could result in significant expenses to remediate any internal
control deficiencies and lead to a decline in our stock price. 

We cannot provide assurance
that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting. As a result, we may be required to implement further remedial measures and to design enhanced processes and controls to address
deficiencies. If we do not effectively remediate the material weaknesses identified by management and maintain adequate internal controls
over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to prepare reliable financial reports and comply with our reporting obligations
under the Exchange Act on a timely basis. Any such delays in the preparation of financial reports and the filing of our periodic reports
may result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect
our business, the market value of our common stock and our access to capital markets. 

45 

Our failure to meet the continued listing
requirements of the Nasdaq could result in a de-listing of our common stock. 

On April 16, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq
stating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Rule because our stockholders equity
of 1,887,777 as of December 31, 2023, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, was below the
minimum requirement of 2,500,000. Pursuant to Nasdaq s Listing Rules, we had 45 calendar days (until May 31, 2024), to submit a
plan to evidence compliance with the Rule (a Compliance Plan ). We submitted a Compliance Plan within the required time.
On July 22, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that based on the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission for the period ended March 31, 2024, and our submission to the Staff, dated May 29, 2024, it determined that we
were in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). The letter further stated that if we fail to evidence compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(b)(1) upon filing our next periodic report we may be subject to delisting. 

On August 26, 2024, we received a letter from
Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with the Rule because the stockholders equity of the Company of 2,018,263
as of June 30, 2024, as reported in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 14, 2024, was below
the minimum requirement of 2,500,000. 

Pursuant to Nasdaq s Listing Rules, we had
45 calendar days (until October 10, 2024), to submit a Compliance Plan. We submitted a Compliance Plan within the required time, although
there can be no assurance that the Compliance Plan will be accepted by Nasdaq. If the Compliance Plan is accepted by Nasdaq, we will be
granted an extension of up to 180 calendar days from August 26, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Rule. In the event the Compliance
Plan is not accepted by Nasdaq, or in the event the Compliance Plan is accepted but we fail to evidence compliance within the extension
period, we will have the right to a hearing before Nasdaq s Hearing Panel. The hearing request would stay any suspension or delisting
action pending the conclusion of the hearing process and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the panel following
the hearing. 

We intend to monitor our stockholders equity
and, if appropriate, consider further available options to evidence compliance with the stockholders equity requirement. 

On April 25, 2024, we received written notice
from Nasdaq notifying us that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days (March 14, 2024 through April 24, 2024), our Common Stock
did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 Minimum Bid Price Requirement per share as required by Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided a 180-calendar day period, or until October 22,
2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, following
stockholder approval at our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on July 2, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of
one (1) to twenty (20) on October 8, 2024, at which time our Common Stock began trading on a post-split basis. 

On October 22, 2024, we received a notification
letter (the Notification Letter from Nasdaq, informing us that we have regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement
set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, the closing bid of our shares
of common stock needed to be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days. The Notification Letter
confirmed that we achieved a closing bid price of 1.00 or greater per common share for ten (10) consecutive business days from
October 8, 2024 to October 21, 2024, thereby regaining compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 

If we fail to meet any of Nasdaq s listing standards,
our Common Stock will be subject to delisting. If that were to occur, our Common Stock would be subject to rules that impose additional
sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements
could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our Common Stock. This would adversely affect the ability of investors
to trade our Common Stock and would adversely affect the value of our Common Stock. Delisting from Nasdaq would cause us to pursue eligibility
for trading of our Common Stock on other markets or exchanges, or on an over-the-counter market. In such case, our stockholders 
ability to trade or obtain quotations of the market value of our Common Stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes
and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices of these securities.
There can be no assurance that our Common Stock, if delisted from the Nasdaq, would be listed on a national securities exchange, a national
quotation service or the over-the-counter markets. Delisting from the Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity, adversely affect
the market liquidity of our Common Stock, decrease securities analysts coverage of us or diminish investor, supplier and employee
confidence. In addition, our stock could become a penny stock, which would make trading of our Common Stock more difficult. 

The delisting of our Common Stock from Nasdaq
may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms in the future, or at all. Such a delisting would likely have a negative
effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. Further,
if our Common Stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our Common Stock would cease to be recognized as a covered security, and we would
be subject to additional regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Moreover, there is no assurance that the actions that
we have taken to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement will stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity
of our Common Stock, prevent our Common Stock from falling below the Nasdaq minimum bid price required for continued listing again or
prevent future non-compliance with other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements.

ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds 

We did not sell any equity securities during the
quarter ended September 3, 2024, in transactions that were not registered under the Securities Act other than as previously
disclosed in our filings with the SEC and as described below. 

On October 15th, 2024, we issued 35,335
shares of our Common Stock to a marketing firm for services provided. The marketing firm was a sophisticated investor, received shares
that had a restricted legend and had adequate access, though their relationship with the Company, to information about the Company. We
believe that such transaction was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(a)(2)
thereof. 

ITEM 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. Other Information 

During the third quarter of 2024, none of
our directors or executive officers or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule
10b5-1 trading arrangement (as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Registration S-K). 

On November 8 th , 2024 the Company entered
into an amendment to the Joint Venture Agreement for Hacienda Olivia Phase II. Pursuant to the amendment, in the event the Joint Venturers

deadlock.

deadlock. 

On November 8 th , 2024 the Company entered
into an amendment to the Joint Venture Agreement for Sugar Phase 1. Pursuant to the amendment, in the event the Joint Venturers are divided

in which the Company (the Offerer may elect to purchase the Joint Venture interest of the other Joint Venturer (the Offeree at an agreed upon valuation of 1,100,000 or the Company shall make the final decision to break the deadlock. 

On November 12 th , 2024 the Company
entered into Credit Extension Agreement (the Extension for the agreement with the Bryan Leighton Revocable Trust Dated

an extension fee of 8,750 dollars and issued an additional 2,500 shares of the Company s restricted common stock as consideration
for the extension. The rate of interest also increased from 12 per annum to 14 per annum retroactive to September 1, 2024. 

On November 13 th , 2024 we entered into

note will bear 10 interest per annum, provide for monthly interest payments and mature on March 15 th , 2025 with the option
to extend up to three times by paying 10,000 for each extension.
