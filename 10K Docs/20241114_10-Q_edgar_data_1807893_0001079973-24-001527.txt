and in its group of bank accounts at its primary lender as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As this
group of bank accounts is funded by the Company s line of credit (see Note 7), overdrafts are an expected part of the cash cycle.

The provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 provide guidance on the recognition, presentation,
and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. ASC 606 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides
guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. ASC 606 requires revenue to be recognized upon transfer of control of
promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for services that
are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. In such cases, revenue would be recognized at the time of delivery
or over time for each performance of service. However, ASC 606 exempts items under ASC 835-30 and ASC 310-20 (i.e. finance charges, late
charges and origination fee income for the Company).

the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

 Overview 

 We are an insurance premium financing
company, specializing primarily in commercial policies. We make it efficient for companies to access financing for insurance premiums.
Enabled by our network of marketing representatives and relationships with insurance agents, we provide a value-driven, customer-focused
lending service. 

We have offered premium financing
since 1991 through our wholly owned subsidiary, Standard Premium Finance Management Corporation. We are generally targeting premium financing
loans from 1,000 to 50,000, with repayment terms ranging from 6 to 10 months, although we may offer larger loans in cases we deem appropriate.
Qualified customers may have multiple financings with us concurrently, which we believe provides opportunities for repeat business, as
well as increased value to our customers. 

We originate loans primarily in
Florida, although we operate in several states. Over the past three years, the Company has expanded its operations, and currently is financing
insurance premiums in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.
Throughout 2023 and 2024, we have obtained additional licenses for a total of thirty-five states. We intend to continue to expand our
market into new states as part of our organic growth trend. Loans are originated primarily through a network of insurance agents solicited
by our in-house sales team and marketing representatives. 

We generate the majority of our
revenue through interest income and the associated fees earned from our loan products. We earn interest based on the rule of 78 
and earn other associated fees as applicable to each loan. These fees include, but are not limited to, a one-time finance charge, late
fees, and NSF fees. Our company charges interest to its customers solely by the Rule of 78. Charging interest per the Rule of 78 is the
industry standard among premium finance loans. The Rule of 78 is a method to calculate the amount of principal and interest paid by each
payment on a loan with equal monthly payments. The Rule of 78 is a permissible method of calculating interest in the states in which we
operate. The Rule of 78 recognizes greater amounts of interest income and lesser amounts of principal repayment during the first months
of the loan, while decreasing interest income and increasing principal repayment during the final months of the loan. Whenever a loan
is repaid prior to full maturity, the Rule of 78 methodology is applied and the borrower is refunded accordingly. 

We rely on a diversified set of
funding sources for the loans we make to our customers. Our primary source of financing has historically been a line of credit at a bank
collateralized by our loan receivables and our other assets. We receive additional funding from unsecured subordinated noteholders that
pays monthly interest to the investors. We have also used proceeds from operating cash flow to fund loans in the past and continue to
finance a portion of our outstanding loans with these funds. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding
our financing strategy. 

The Company s main source
of funding is its line of credit, which represented approximately 63 43,789,908) of its capital and total liabilities as of September
30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s subordinated notes payable and other loans represented approximately 17 12,023,202)
of the Company s capital and total liabilities, operating liabilities provide approximately 9 6,092,894) of the Company s
capital and total liabilities, preferred equity provides approximately 2 1,660,000) of the Company s capital and total liabilities,
and equity in retained earnings and common stock paid-in capital represents the remaining 8 5,516,685) of the Company s capital
and total liabilities.

Gross Revenue 

 Gross Revenue represents
the sum of interest and finance income, associated fees and other revenue. 

 Originations 

 Originations represent
the total principal amount of Loans made during the period. 

 Interest Earned Rate 

 The Interest Earned
Rate is the average annual percentage interest rate earned on new loans. 

 Cost of Funds Rate, Gross 

 Cost of Funds Rate,
Gross is calculated as interest expense divided by average debt outstanding for the period. 

 Cost of Funds Rate, Net 

 Cost of Funds Rate,
Net is calculated as interest expense divided by average debt outstanding for the period, net of the interest related tax benefit. 

 Reserve Ratio 

 Reserve Ratio is our
allowance for credit losses at the end of the period divided by the total amount of principal outstanding on Loans at the end of the period.
It excludes net deferred origination costs and associated fees. 

24 

Provision Rate 

 Provision Rate equals
the provision for credit losses for the period divided by originations for the period. Because we reserve for probable credit losses inherent
in the portfolio upon origination, this rate is significantly impacted by the expectation of credit losses for the period s originations
volume. This rate is also impacted by changes in loss expectations for contract receivables originated prior to the commencement of the
period. 

 Return on Assets 

 Return on Assets is
calculated as annualized net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the period divided by average total assets for the
period. 

 Return on Equity

Revenue 

 Revenue increased by 18.5 overall or 478,988
to 3,073,347 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,594,359 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
in revenue was primarily due to a 19.8 or 443,141 increase in finance charges and a 12.8 or 34,191 increase in late charges. Revenue
from finance charges comprised 87.2 and 86.2 of overall revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 During the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, the company financed an additional 1,262,830 in new loan originations,
an increase of 3.6 . This increase was due largely to increased marketing efforts throughout our established states and new states, primarily
by hiring additional marketing representatives in Florida and Texas. The total quantity of loan originations remained relatively stable
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The quantity of loan originations
is directly correlated to the origination charge revenue, as the Company immediately recognizes an origination fee on substantially all
new loans. 

 Under the terms
of the line of credit agreement, the loan receivables and our other assets provide the collateral for the loan. As the receivables increase,
driven by new sales, the company has greater borrowing power, giving it the opportunity to generate additional sales. In November 2022,
the Company extended the maturity of this line of credit until November 30, 2025. See Future Cash Requirements for the Company s
strategy regarding its line of credit. 

 Expense 

 Expenses increased
by 9.3 or 226,656 to 2,666,521 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,439,865 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

 The increase in expenses was primarily
due to increases in the following categories: 

126,625 increase in interest expense as a result of increased borrowings on the line of credit to fund growth in the loan portfolio. Due to benchmark interest rate increases adopted by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2022 and 2023, interest rates throughout the marketplace have increased accordingly. Our line of credit features a variable interest rate based on one-month SOFR. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our line of credit s interest rate was 7.95 and 8.08 , respectively. However, as of September 30, 2024, our net borrowings on the line
of credit had increased by 2,318,008 to 43,791,747 from 41,473,739 at September 30, 2023. This increase in borrowings is due primarily
to increased loan originations. 

71,318 increase in salaries and wages expense primarily related to the hiring of additional marketing representatives in new and existing territories. The Company also offered general wage increases for its existing staff. 

101,855 increase in commission expense as a result of increased originations. 

The increase in expenses was offset due
to a decrease in the following category: 

41,742 decrease in the provision for credit losses due to a change in the mix of write-offs that included more contra-revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Income before Taxes 

 Income before taxes increased by 252,332
to 406,826 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 154,494 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
attributable to the net increases and decreases as discussed above. 

 Income Tax Provision 

 Income tax provision increased 68,635
to 106,199 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 37,564 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
primarily attributable to an increase in taxable income. 

 Net Income 

 Net Income increased by 183,697 to 300,627
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 116,930 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable
to the 252,332 increase in income before taxes related primarily to increased finance charge revenue partially offset by the 68,635
increase in the provision for income taxes.

to 9,022,598 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6,981,603 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
in revenue was primarily due to a 31.9 or 1,898,533 increase in finance charges and a 16.4 or 124,244 increase in late charges. Revenue
from finance charges comprised 87.0 and 85.2 of overall revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 During the nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the company financed an additional 17,731,707 in new loan originations,
an increase of 18.1 . This increase was due largely to increased marketing efforts throughout our established states and new states, primarily
by hiring additional marketing representatives in Florida and Texas. The total quantity of loan originations remained relatively stable
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The quantity of loan originations

Expense 

 Expenses increased
by 23.3 or 1,517,256 to 8,015,938 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6,498,682 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

 The increase in expenses was primarily
due to increases in the following categories: 

627,910 increase in interest expense as a result of increased borrowings on the line of credit to fund growth in the loan portfolio. Due to benchmark interest rate increases adopted by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2022 and 2023, interest rates throughout the marketplace have increased accordingly. Our line of credit features a variable interest rate based on one-month SOFR. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our line of credit s interest rate was 7.95 and 8.08 , respectively. However, as of September 30, 2024, our net borrowings on the line
of credit had increased by 2,318,008 to 43,791,747 from 41,473,739 at September 30, 2023. This increase in borrowings is due primarily
to increased loan originations. 

320,172 increase in commission expense as a result of increased originations. 

283,379 increase in salaries and wages expense primarily related to the hiring of additional marketing representatives in new and existing territories. The Company also offered general wage increases for its existing staff. 

140,656 increase in provision for credit losses as a result of increases to the size of the loan portfolio. We maintained consistent allowance practices throughout 2024, which kept the reserves adequate for the size of the growing loan receivable portfolio. 

102,309 increase in other operating expenses as a result of general increases in overhead costs and a profit-sharing expense reversal during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the transfer of assets from a profit-sharing plan to a 401(k) plan for employee benefit management. 

Income before Taxes 

 Income before taxes increased by 523,739
to 1,006,660 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 482,921 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
attributable to the net increases and decreases as discussed above. 

 Income Tax Provision 

 Income tax provision increased 138,709
to 259,779 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 121,070 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
primarily attributable to an increase in taxable income. 

 Net Income 

 Net income increased by 385,030 to 746,881
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 361,851 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable
to the 523,739 increase in income before taxes related primarily to increased finance charge revenue offset by the 138,709 increase
in the provision for income taxes. 

 LIQUIDITY and CAPITAL RESOURCES as
of September 30, 2024 

 We
had 2,150 of cash and a working capital surplus of 15,084,023 at September 30, 2024. A significant working capital surplus is generally
expected through the normal course of business due primarily to the difference between the balance in loan receivables and the related
line of credit liability. As discussed in the Revenues section, the Company s line of credit is currently the primary source of
operating funds. In February 2021, the Company entered into a contract with a new lender, First Horizon Bank, for a two-year 35,000,000
line of credit. In October 2021, the Company further increased its borrowing power on its line of credit to 45,000,000, an increase of
 10,000,000. In November 2022, the Company extended the maturity of this line of credit until November 30, 2025 and replaced the benchmark
rate of the loan from 30-day LIBOR to 30-day SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate). LIBOR ceased to be published after June 30, 2023.
The terms of the amended line of credit include an interest rate based on the 30-day SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.55 - 2.96 ,
with a minimum rate of 3.35 . The applicable margin is based on the Company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company s applicable margin was 2.75 . On November 14, 2023, the Company executed an amendment of
the loan agreement, which provided a waiver of default on its Interest Coverage Ratio as of September 30, 2023. The amendment also reduced
the Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the following four quarters through September 30, 2024. We anticipate that the interest rate we
pay on our revolving credit agreement will remain elevated, but decrease over the next twelve months due to the expectations surrounding
benchmark interest rate decreases by the Federal Reserve Board. We believe that we will be able to pass along a portion of the interest
rate decreases to our net interest spread, which can improve profitability. Because of the short-term nature of our loans, we are not
bound to any particular loan and its fixed interest rate for a long period of time. Based on our estimates and taking into account the
risks and uncertainties of our plans, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate our business and repay our
obligations as they become due in the next twelve months. 

 During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised an additional 2,148,689 in subordinated notes payable related parties
and 1,028,000 in subordinated notes payable. The Company repaid 100,000 of notes payable and 10,000 of subordinated notes payable 
related parties. The Company utilizes its inflows from subordinated debt as a financing source before drawing additionally from the line
of credit. 

28 

Future
Cash Requirements 

As the Company anticipates its growth patterns
to continue, the larger line of credit is paramount to fueling this growth. The Company s line of credit is 45,000,000 and its
maturity on its line of credit facility is November 30, 2025. The extended maturity provides stability for the Company s future
cash requirements. 

 Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 We require cash to fund our operating expenses
and working capital requirements, including costs associated with our premium finance loans, capital expenditures, debt repayments, acquisitions
(if any), pursuing market expansion, supporting sales and marketing activities, and other general corporate purposes. While we believe
we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and repay our debt, we may elect to pursue additional financing
activities such as refinancing or expanding existing debt or pursuing other debt or equity offerings to provide flexibility with our cash
management and provide capital for potential acquisitions. 

 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

 None. 

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES 

 We consider the following to be our
most critical accounting policy because it involves critical accounting estimates and a significant degree of management judgment: 

 Allowance for credit
losses 

 We are subject to the risk
of loss associated with our borrowers inability to fulfill their payment obligations, the risk that we will not collect sufficient
unearned premium refunds on the cancelled policies on the defaulted loans to fully cover the unpaid loan principal and the risk that payments
due us from insurance agents and brokers will not be paid. 

 The carrying amount of
the Premium Finance Contracts Contracts is reduced by an allowance for credit losses that are maintained at a level which,
in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the Contracts. The amount of the allowance is based upon management s
evaluation of the collectability of the Contracts, including the nature of the accounts, credit concentration, trends, and historical
data, specific impaired Contracts, economic conditions, and other risks inherent in the Contracts. The allowance is increased by a provision
for credit losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recovery. 

 In
addition, additional scrutiny is placed on accounts over 120 days to determine whether specific allowances should be maintained. Individual
contracts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual contracts appears doubtful. The collectability of outstanding
and cancelled contracts is generally secured by collateral in the form of the unearned premiums on the underlying policies and accordingly
historical losses are approximately 1 to 1.5 of the principal amount of loans made each year. The Company considers historical losses
as well as forward-looking attributes in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The collectability of amounts due
from agents is determined by the financial strength of the agency. 

 Stock-Based
Compensation 

We account for stock-based compensation
by measuring and recognizing as compensation expense the fair value of all share-based payment awards made to directors, executives, employees
and consultants, including employee stock options related to our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and stock warrants based on estimated grant
date fair values. The determination of fair value involves a number of significant estimates. We use the Black Scholes option pricing
model to estimate the value of employee stock options and stock warrants which requires a number of assumptions to determine the model
inputs. These include the expected volatility of our stock and employee exercise behavior which are based expectations of future developments
over the term of the option. 

29 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk. 

 Not required. 

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange
Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
