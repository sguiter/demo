allowance for credit losses was recorded for these assets at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Carrying values of interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold exclude accrued interest receivable of million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. 
 Based upon the collateral held as security and collateral maintenance provisions with its counterparties, the Bank determined that allowance for credit losses was needed for its securities purchased under agreements to resell at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The carrying value of securities purchased under agreements to resell excludes a de minimis amount and million of accrued interest receivable as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Debt Securities 
 The Bank invests in debt securities, which are classified as AFS or HTM. Within these investments, the Bank is primarily subject to credit risk related to private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (PLRMBS) that are supported by underlying mortgage loans. The Bank is prohibited by Finance Agency regulations from purchasing certain higher risk securities, such as equity securities and debt instruments that are not investment quality at the time of purchase.

allowance for credit losses was recorded on these AFS or HTM securities at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 Private-Label Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities The Bank also holds investments in PLRMBS. The Bank has not purchased any PLRMBS since the first quarter of 2008. Many of these securities have subsequently experienced significant credit deterioration. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, approximately and , respectively, of PLRMBS (AFS and HTM combined, based on amortized cost) were rated A, or above, by an NRSRO; and the remaining securities were either rated less than A, or were unrated. To determine whether an allowance for credit loss is necessary on these securities, the Bank uses cash flow analyses. 
 At each quarter end, the Bank compares the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected on its PLRMBS, using the effective interest rate, to the amortized cost basis of the securities to determine whether a credit loss exists. The expected credit losses are measured using: 
 expected housing price changes; 
 expected interest rate assumptions; 
 the remaining payment terms for the security; 
 expected default rates based on underlying loan-level borrower and loan characteristics; 
 loss severities on the collateral supporting each unique PLRMBS based on underlying loan-level borrower and loan characteristics; and 
 prepayment speeds based on underlying loan-level borrower and loan characteristics. 
 The expected cash flows are based on a number of assumptions and expectations, and the results of these models can vary significantly with changes in these assumptions and expectations. The cash flows determined reflect management s expectations and include a base case housing price forecast for near- and long-term horizons. 
 For all the PLRMBS in its AFS and HTM portfolios, the Bank does not intend to sell any security and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell any security before its anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. 
 For PLRMBS with previous credit losses related to the prior methodology of evaluating credit losses (securities for which the Bank determined that it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis), measurement of the credit loss amount for PLRMBS classified as Level 3 as of September 30, 2024, uses significant inputs and assumptions that include, based on unpaid principal balance, the weighted average percentage of prepayment rates of ; default rates of ; and loss severities of . The weighted average percentage of the related current

as of September 30, 2024. Credit enhancement is defined as the percentage of subordinated tranches, excess spread, and over-collateralization, if any, in a security structure that will generally absorb losses before the Bank will experience a loss on the security. 
 In general, the Bank elects to transfer any PLRMBS that incurred a credit loss during the applicable period from the Bank s HTM portfolio to its AFS portfolio at their fair values. There were transfers of PLRMBS from the Bank s HTM portfolio to its AFS portfolio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, or during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Bank transferred PLRMBS from its HTM portfolio to its AFS portfolio with an amortized cost and fair value of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the Bank s PLRMBS, the Bank recorded a reversal of credit losses of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, largely as a result of improvements in the fair values of the underlying collateral on certain securities. The Bank recorded a provision for credit losses of million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely because of declines in the fair values, the present value of expected cash flows of certain PLRMBS, and decreased expectations of the performance of loan collateral underlying these securities.

of the Bank s credit products were past due or on nonaccrual status. There were no modifications to credit products related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Based on the collateral pledged as security for advances, the Bank s credit analyses of borrowers financial condition, repayment history on advances, and the Bank s credit extension and collateral policies as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Bank expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms. Therefore, allowance for credit losses on advances was deemed necessary by the Bank as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 Payment Status of Mortgage Loans. Payment status is the key credit quality indicator for conventional mortgage loans and allows the Bank to monitor the migration of past due loans. A past due loan is one where the borrower has failed to make a scheduled full payment of principal and interest within 30 days of its due date. Other delinquency statistics include nonaccrual loans and loans in process of foreclosure.

 (2) Includes loans for which the servicer has reported a decision to foreclose or to pursue a similar alternative, such as deed-in-lieu. Loans in process of foreclosure are included in past due or current loans depending on their delinquency status. 
 (3) At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, million of mortgage loans on nonaccrual status did not have an associated allowance for credit losses because these loans were either previously charged off to the expected recoverable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, including any credit enhancements, is greater than the amortized cost of the loans. 
 (4) Represents loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure as a percentage of the recorded investment of total mortgage loans outstanding. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio. Mortgage loans held for portfolio are evaluated on a loan-level basis for expected credit losses. The Bank determines its allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans held for portfolio through analyses that include consideration of various loan portfolio and collateral related characteristics, such as past performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions. 
 At both September 30, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses on the mortgage loan portfolio was million.

 The Bank s capital plan requires each shareholder to own capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of its membership capital stock requirement or its activity-based capital stock requirement. The Bank may adjust these requirements from time to time within ranges established in the capital plan. Any changes to the capital plan must be approved by the Bank s board of directors (Board) and the Finance Agency. 
 Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock. The Bank had mandatorily redeemable capital stock totaling million outstanding to institutions at September 30, 2024, and million outstanding to institutions at December 31, 2023. These amounts have been classified as a liability on the Bank s Statements of Condition.

 (1) Represents mandatorily redeemable capital stock that is past the end of the contractual redemption period because there is activity outstanding to which the mandatorily redeemable capital stock relates. 
 If activity-based stock becomes excess stock as a result of an activity no longer remaining outstanding, the Bank may repurchase those shares, at its sole discretion, subject to the statutory and regulatory restrictions on excess stock redemption. 
 Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework. The Bank s Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework (Framework) assesses the level and adequacy of retained earnings and establishes amounts to be retained in restricted retained earnings, which are not made available in the current dividend period, and maintains an amount of total retained earnings at least equal to its required retained

billion to billion mainly attributable to lower advance balances. The Bank s retained earnings requirement may be changed at any time. The Board periodically reviews the retained earnings methodology and analysis to determine whether any adjustments are appropriate. 
 Dividend Payments Finance Agency rules state that FHLBanks may declare and pay dividends only from previously retained earnings or current net earnings and may not declare or pay dividends based on projected or anticipated earnings. In addition, Finance Agency rules do not permit the Bank to pay dividends in the form of capital stock if its excess stock exceeds of its total assets. Excess stock is defined as the aggregate of the capital stock held by each shareholder in excess of its minimum capital stock requirement, as established by the Bank s capital plan. Excess stock totaled million, or of total assets as of September 30, 2024. Excess stock totaled million, or of total assets as of December 31, 2023. 
 Dividends on capital stock are recognized as dividends on the Statements of Capital Accounts, and dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are recognized as interest expense on the Statements of Income. The Bank pays dividends in cash. On October 24, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on the capital stock outstanding during the third quarter of 2024 at an annualized rate of , totaling million. The Bank recorded the dividend on October 24, 2024, and expects to pay the dividend on November 12, 2024. 
 Excess Stock The Bank s capital plan provides that the Bank may repurchase some or all of a shareholder s excess stock at the Bank s discretion, subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements. The Bank may also repurchase all of a member s excess stock at a member s request, at the Bank s discretion, subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements. 
 The Bank is required to redeem any mandatorily redeemable capital stock that is in excess of a former member s minimum stock requirement on or after the expiration of the five-year redemption date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank redeemed a de minimis amount in mandatorily redeemable capital stock, for which the five-year redemption period had expired, at its par value per share. The stock was redeemed on the scheduled redemption dates or, for stock that was not excess stock on its scheduled redemption date because of outstanding activity with the Bank, on the first available repurchase date after the stock was no longer required to support outstanding activity with the Bank. 
 For more information on the Bank s membership capital stock requirement and activity-based capital stock requirement, mandatorily redeemable capital stock, excess stock repurchase, retained earnings, and dividend framework, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11 Capital in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Concentration. The following table presents the concentration in capital stock held by institutions whose capital stock ownership represented 10 or more of the Bank s outstanding capital stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock, as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023:

On the same date, the FDIC transferred all of the deposits and substantially all of the assets of First Republic Bank, including the advances outstanding from the Bank, to JPMorgan Chase, National Association, a nonmember. Upon assumption of the advances outstanding by JPMorgan Chase, National Association, the Bank transferred million of capital stock of the Bank, held by First Republic Bank, to JPMorgan Chase, National Association, and reclassified that capital stock to mandatorily redeemable as a liability in the Bank s Statements of Condition.

 Based on the Bank s credit analyses and the collateral requirements, the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on its derivative transactions. 
 The Bank s agreements for uncleared derivative transactions contain provisions that link the Bank s credit rating from Moody s Investors Service and S P Global Ratings to various rights and obligations. Certain of these derivative agreements provide that, if the Bank s long-term debt rating falls below a specified rating (ranging from A3/A- to Baa3/BBB-), the Bank s counterparty would have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate all of its

Summary of Valuation Methodologies and Primary Inputs. For more information related to the valuation methodologies and primary inputs used to develop the measurement of fair value for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis in the Statements of Condition, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 Fair Value in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in these valuation methodologies and primary inputs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Subjectivity of Estimates Related to Fair Values of Financial Instruments. Estimates of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the methodologies described above are subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters, such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, prepayment speed assumptions, expected interest rate volatility, methods to determine possible distributions of future interest rates used to value options, and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. Changes in these judgments may have a material effect on the fair value estimates.

 Readers of this report should not rely solely on the forward-looking statements and should consider all risks and uncertainties addressed throughout this report, as well as those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Bank s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). 
 
 Quarterly Overview 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 102 million, a decrease of 1 million compared with net income of 103 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 1 million decrease in net income relative to the prior-year period was primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income of 25 million and an increase in other expense of 10 million, offset by an increase in other income/(loss) of 23 million and a change in the provision for/(reversal of) credit losses of 11 million. 
 The 25 million decrease in net interest income was mainly attributable to lower average balances of advances and short-term investments and higher costs of consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes. The decrease was partially offset by lower average balances of consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes. 
 The 10 million increase in other expense was primarily attributable to the Bank s increase in charitable "mission-oriented" contributions mainly to fund downpayment assistance grants to middle-income homebuyers (delivered by participating member financial institutions). In 2023, the Bank s board of directors (Board) approved plans to voluntarily allocate up to 5 of the Bank s prior year s net earnings (income before interest expense related to dividends paid on mandatorily redeemable capital stock and the assessment for the AHP) to fund economic development and homeownership grant programs. These charitable contributions, which were in addition to the Bank s statutory affordable housing program assessment, resulted in the increased voluntary contributions expense and, as a consequence, decreased the Bank s net income and retained earnings for the third quarter of 2024. The Bank continues to evaluate funding of programs meeting community needs for affordable housing, funding for businesses, and community development, and may change the levels of voluntary contributions in the future, which may further impact the Bank s net income and retained earnings. For more information on the Bank s charitable contributions, see Item 1. Business Voluntary Programs in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The 23 million increase in other income/(loss) was primarily driven by an overall improvement in net fair values on the Bank's financial instruments carried at fair value, partially offset by a net decrease in fair value on interest rate swaps classified as economic hedges. The 11 million change in the provision for/(reversal of) credit losses was related to an improvement in the fair values of certain private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (PLRMBS). 
 At September 30, 2024, total assets were 83.3 billion, a decrease of 9.5 billion from 92.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The primary driver for the decrease was a decline in advances, which decreased by 11.8 billion from 61.3 billion at December 31, 2023, to 49.5 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily driven by maturities of advances totaling 9.7 billion acquired by nonmembers in connection with certain Bank member acquisitions. Investments at September 30, 2024 were 32.6 billion, a net increase of 2.3 billion from 30.3 billion at December 31, 2023, attributable to increases of 1.4 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, 525 million in mortgage-backed securities, and 381 million in short-term investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Bank exceeded its 4.0 regulatory requirement with a regulatory capital ratio of 8.8 at September 30, 2024. The increase in the regulatory capital ratio from 8.0 at December 31, 2023, mainly resulted from the decrease in total assets during the first nine months of 2024. The Bank also exceeded its risk-based capital requirement of 1.1 billion with 7.3 billion in 
 38

 permanent capital. T otal retained earnings increased to 4.4 billion at September 30, 2024, from 4.3 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 On October 24, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on the average capital stock outstanding during the third quarter of 2024 at an annualized rate of 8.75 . The quarterly dividend rate is consistent with the Bank's dividend philosophy of endeavoring to pay a quarterly dividend rate that is equal to or greater than the current market rate for highly rated investments and that is sustainable under current and projected earnings while maintaining appropriate levels of capital. The quarterly dividend will total 65 million, and the Bank expects to pay the dividend on November 12, 2024.

 (2) As provided by the FHLBank Act or regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks, all of the FHLBanks have joint and several liability for FHLBank consolidated obligations, which are backed only by the financial resources of the FHLBanks. The joint and several liability regulation authorizes the Finance Agency to require any FHLBank to repay all or a portion of the principal or interest on consolidated obligations for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor. The Bank has never been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, and as of September 30, 2024, and through the filing date of this report, does not believe that it is probable that it will be asked to do so. 
 (3) Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income (annualized) divided by average interest-earning assets. 
 (4) This ratio is calculated as dividends per share declared, recorded, and paid on Class B capital stock during the period divided by net income per share. The ratio excludes dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability). 
 (5) This ratio is calculated as regulatory capital divided by total assets. Regulatory capital includes retained earnings, Class B capital stock, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability) but excludes AOCI. 

Results of Operations 
 Net Interest Income. The primary source of the Bank s earnings is net interest income, which is the interest earned on advances, mortgage loans, and investments, less interest paid on consolidated obligations, deposits, mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and other borrowings. The tables that follow present the average balances of interest-earning asset categories and the sources that funded those interest-earning assets (liabilities and capital) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, together with the related interest income and expense. These tables also present the average rates on total interest-earning assets and the average costs of total funding sources.

 The net interest margin was 70 basis points for the third quarter of 2024, 2 basis points higher than the net interest margin for the third quarter of 2023, which was 68 basis points. The increase in net interest margin is primarily attributable to an increase in the average balances of AFS securities of 4.8 billion from 14.8 billion during the 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 three months ended September 30, 2023, to 19.6 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by an increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities to 5.33 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.23 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Member demand for wholesale funding from the Bank can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including economic and market conditions affecting the liquidity or solvency of the Bank s members and potential members, competition from other wholesale funding sources, member deposit inflows and outflows and changes in liquidity, the activity level of the primary and secondary mortgage markets, and strategic decisions made by individual member institutions, including those related to business combinations. Accordingly, Bank asset levels and operating results may vary significantly from period to period. Events affecting the financial services industry contributed to the liquidation or receivership of some of the Bank s larger borrowers during 2023. The loss of Bank members through liquidation, receivership, or acquisition by nonmember institutions, especially involving some of the Bank s larger borrowers, has had the effect of reducing aggregate member demand for wholesale funding, as nonmembers (including former members and member successors) are not eligible to borrow new advances or renew existing advances as they mature. This has resulted in lower levels of advance balances and a reduction in total interest income earned from advances. As a result of the inability of nonmembers to seek new advances from the Bank, the Bank s level of advances and the associated net interest income in the future will be determined by many factors including the Bank members ability to generate new business to seek new advances or consolidation within the banking industry. The loss of advances outstanding to nonmember borrowers is likely to have an adverse impact over time on the Bank s financial performance and may reduce the Bank s ability to grow advances in the future and impact the Bank s long-term strategic plans and operations. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4 Advances for more information on the Bank s largest members and Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quarterly Overview for more information on the loss of the Bank s largest borrowers and its potential effect on the Bank s opportunity to grow advances.

 Net Gain/(Loss) on Advances and Consolidated Obligation Bonds Held Under Fair Value Option Under the fair value option, the Bank has elected to carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. In general, transactions elected for the fair value option are in economic hedge relationships. Gains or losses on these transactions are generally offset by losses or gains on the derivatives that economically hedge these instruments. 
 The net gains/(losses) on advances and consolidated obligation bonds held under the fair value option were primarily driven by the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors relative to the actual terms and volume of the advances and consolidated obligation bonds during the period. 
 Additional information about advances and consolidated obligation bonds held under the fair value option is provided in Item 1. Financial Statements Note 11 Fair Value. 
 Net Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives Accounting guidance requires the Bank to carry all of its derivative instruments on the Statements of Condition at fair value. Certain derivatives are associated with assets or liabilities but do not

 qualify as fair value hedges. These economic hedges are recorded on the Statements of Condition at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss recorded in earnings without any offsetting unrealized gain or loss from the associated asset or liability. 
 The following table shows the accounting classification of economic hedges and the categories of hedged items that contributed to the gains and losses on derivatives that were recorded in Net gain/(loss) on derivatives in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023.

 During the third quarter of 2024, net losses on derivatives totaled 49 million compared to net gains of 15 million in the third quarter of 2023. These amounts included interest income of 11 million and 3 million resulting from net settlements on derivative instruments used in economic hedges in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of interest income or expense from net settlements on derivative instruments used in economic hedges, the gains or losses on economic hedges were primarily associated with the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors during the period. The ongoing impact of these valuation adjustments on the Bank cannot be predicted and the effects of these valuation adjustments may lead to significant volatility in future earnings, including earnings available for dividends. 
 Additional information about derivatives and hedging activities is provided in Item 1. Financial Statements Note 10 Derivatives and Hedging Activities. 
 Other Expense. During the third quarter of 2024, other expenses totaled 65 million, compared to 55 million in the third quarter of 2023. The 10 million increase in other expense was primarily attributable to the Bank s increase in charitable "mission-oriented" contributions mainly to fund downpayment assistance grants to middle-income homebuyers (delivered by participating member financial institutions). In 2023, the Bank s Board approved plans to voluntarily allocate up to 5 of the Bank s prior year s net earnings (income before interest expense related to dividends paid on mandatorily redeemable capital stock and the assessment for the AHP) to fund economic development and homeownership grant programs. These charitable contributions, which were in addition to the Bank s statutory affordable housing program assessment, resulted in the increased voluntary contributions expense and, as a consequence, decreased the Bank s net income and retained earnings for the third quarter of 2024. The Bank continues to evaluate funding of programs meeting community needs for affordable housing, funding for businesses, and community development, and may change the levels of voluntary contributions in the future, which may further impact the Bank s net income and retained earnings. For more information on the Bank s charitable contributions, see Item 1. Business Voluntary Programs in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K.

 Affordable Housing Program. The FHLBank Act requires each FHLBank to establish and fund an affordable housing program (AHP). Each FHLBank s AHP provides subsidies to members, who use the funds to assist in the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of housing for households earning up to 80 of the median income for the area in which they live. Subsidies may be in the form of direct grants or below-market interest rate advances. 
 To fund the AHP, the FHLBanks must set aside at least, in the aggregate, the greater of 100 million or 10 of the current year's net earnings. To the extent that the aggregate 10 calculation is less than 100 million, the FHLBank Act requires that each FHLBank contribute such prorated sums as may be required to ensure that the aggregate contribution of the FHLBanks equals at least 100 million. The proration would be made on the basis of the income of the FHLBanks for the previous year. 
 The Bank s total AHP assessments equaled 13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Return on Average Equity. Return on average equity (ROE) was 5.88 (annualized) for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 6.17 (annualized) for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in average equity from 6.6 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to 6.9 billion in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Dividends and Retained Earnings. In the third quarter of 2024, the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of 8.75 , totaling 65 million, including 52 million in dividends on capital stock and 13 million in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. In the third quarter of 2023, the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of 7.75 , totaling 76 million, including 63 million in dividends on capital stock and 13 million in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock.

 Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 432 million, a 32 decrease from 637 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net interest income compared to the prior-year period was attributable to lower average balances of interest-earning assets and higher costs of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets and lower average balances of interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in net interest income was also attributable to the difference in net advance prepayment fees between the two periods. During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank recognized net prepayment fee interest income of 5 million, comprising 1 million in prepayment fees received from borrowers and 17 million in hedging-related net realized gains associated with the prepaid advances, offset by 13 million in prepayment fees paid to borrowers. In contrast, during the first nine months of 2023, the Bank recognized net prepayment fee interest income of 99 million, comprising 290 million in prepayment fees received from borrowers, offset by 21 million in prepayment fees paid to borrowers and 170 million in hedging-related net realized losses associated with the prepaid advances. 
 The following table details the changes in interest income and interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The net interest margin was 68 basis points for the first nine months of 2024, 2 basis points lower than the net interest margin for the first nine months of 2023, which was 70 basis points. The decrease in net interest margin is primarily attributable to 99 million in net prepayment fee interest income in the prior-year period, compared to net prepayment fee interest income of 5 million during the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in net interest margin was also the result of a decrease in the average balances of interest-earning assets for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the prior-year period, and an increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities to 5.39 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 4.87 for the first nine months of 2023. These effects were partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the prior-year period, and an increase in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets to 5.63 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Member demand for wholesale funding from the Bank can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including economic and market conditions affecting the liquidity or solvency of the Bank s members and potential members, competition from other wholesale funding sources, member deposit inflows and outflows and changes in liquidity, the activity level of the primary and secondary mortgage markets, and strategic decisions made by individual member institutions, including those related to business combinations. Accordingly, Bank asset levels and operating results may vary significantly from period to period. Events affecting the financial services industry contributed to the liquidation or receivership of some of the Bank s larger borrowers during 2023. The loss of Bank members through liquidation, receivership, or acquisition by nonmember institutions, especially involving some of the Bank s larger borrowers, has had the effect of reducing aggregate member demand for wholesale funding, as nonmembers (including former members and member successors) are not eligible to borrow new advances or renew existing advances as they mature. This has resulted in lower levels of advance balances and a reduction in total interest income earned from advances. As a result of the inability of nonmembers to seek new advances from the Bank, the Bank s level of advances and the associated net interest income in the future will be determined by many factors including the Bank members ability to generate new business to seek new advances or consolidation within the banking industry. The loss of advances outstanding to nonmember borrowers is likely to have an adverse impact over time on the Bank s financial performance and may reduce the Bank s ability to grow advances in the future and impact the Bank s long-term strategic plans and operations.

 Net Gain/(Loss) on Advances and Consolidated Obligation Bonds Held Under Fair Value Option The net gains/(losses) on advances and consolidated obligation bonds held under the fair value option were primarily driven by the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors relative to the actual terms and volume of the advances and consolidated obligation bonds during the period. 
 Additional information about advances and consolidated obligation bonds held under the fair value option is provided in Item 1. Financial Statements Note 11 Fair Value. 
 Net Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives The following table shows the accounting classification of economic hedges and the categories of hedged items that contributed to the gains and losses on derivatives that were recorded in Net gain/(loss) on derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 During the first nine months of 2024, net losses on derivatives totaled 31 million compared to net losses of 6 million in the first nine months of 2023. These amounts included interest income of 24 million and interest income of 2 million resulting from net settlements on derivative instruments used in economic hedges in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of interest income or expense from net settlements on derivative instruments used in economic hedges, the gains or losses on economic hedges were primarily associated with the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors during the period. The ongoing impact of these valuation adjustments on the Bank cannot be predicted and the effects of these valuation adjustments may lead to significant volatility in future earnings, including earnings available for dividends. 
 Additional information about derivatives and hedging activities is provided in Item 1. Financial Statements Note 10 Derivatives and Hedging Activities. 
 Termination of Long-Term Funding Arrangement In connection with certain litigation involving its PLRMBS, the Bank entered into a long-term funding arrangement in 2017 with a member, under which the member agreed to obtain or maintain certain advances from the Bank. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank terminated the long-term funding arrangement, and in accordance with its terms, recognized 30 million of other income. 
 Other Expense. During the first nine months of 2024, other expenses totaled 162 million, compared to 148 million in the first nine months of 2023. The 14 million increase in other expense was primarily attributable to the Bank s increase in charitable "mission-oriented" contributions mainly to fund downpayment assistance grants to middle-income homebuyers (delivered by participating member financial institutions). 
 Affordable Housing Program. The Bank s total AHP assessments equaled 41 million and 48 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Return on Average Equity. ROE (annualized) was 6.15 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 7.69 for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease reflected lower net income for the first nine months of 2024, which decreased 26 to 312 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 419 million in the first nine months of 2023, which was partially offset by a decrease in average equity to 6.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 from 7.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023.

 Dividends and Retained Earnings. In the first nine months of 2024, the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of 8.75 , totaling 200 million, including 156 million in dividends on capital stock and 44 million in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. In the first nine months of 2023, the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of 7.26 , totaling 206 million, including 191 million in dividends on capital stock and 15 million in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock.

Financial Condition 
 Total assets were 83.3 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 92.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Advances decreased by 11.8 billion, or 19 , to 49.5 billion at September 30, 2024, from 61.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Average advances were 53.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024, a 35 decrease from 82.0 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Average MBS investments were 15.3 billion for the first nine months of 2024, a 30 increase from 11.8 billion for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Advances outstanding at September 30, 2024, included net unrealized gains of 55 million, of which 33 million represented unrealized losses on hedged advances and 88 million represented unrealized gains on economically hedged advances that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. Advances outstanding at December 31, 2023, included net unrealized losses of 375 million, of which 371 million represented unrealized losses on hedged advances and 4 million represented unrealized losses on economically hedged advances that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The change in the net unrealized gains and losses on advances from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors relative to the actual terms and volume of the advances during the period. 
 The Bank invests in interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold. These investments are funded with longer tenor debt to create liquidity. 
 Total liabilities were 76.4 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 9.8 billion from 86.2 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting a 9.7 billion decrease in consolidated obligations outstanding to 73.8 billion at September 30, 2024, from 83.5 billion at December 31, 2023. Average consolidated obligations were 76.2 billion for the first nine months of 2024 and 111.3 billion for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Consolidated obligations outstanding at September 30, 2024, included net unrealized gains of 294 million on hedged consolidated obligation bonds and unrealized gains of 13 million on economically hedged consolidated obligation bonds that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. Consolidated obligations outstanding at December 31, 2023, included net unrealized gains of 645 million on hedged consolidated obligation bonds and unrealized gains of 29 million on economically hedged consolidated obligation bonds that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The change in the net unrealized gains on the consolidated obligation bonds from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors relative to consolidated obligation bond terms and volumes during the period. 
 As provided by the FHLBank Act or regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks, all FHLBanks have joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations. The joint and several liability regulation authorizes the Finance Agency to require any FHLBank to repay all or a portion of the principal or interest on consolidated obligations for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor. The Bank has never been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, and as of September 30, 2024, and through the filing date of this report, does not believe that it is probable that it will be

 asked to do so. The par value of the outstanding consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks was 1.2 trillion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 For further information and discussion of the Bank s joint and several liability for FHLBank consolidated obligations, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition and Item 1. Financial Statements Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies. 
 The average balances of interest-bearing demand and overnight deposits were 900 million and 856 million, and the weighted average interest rates paid on interest-bearing demand and overnight deposits were 5.22 and 4.93 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average balances of term deposits were 7 million and 10 million and the weighted average interest rates paid on term deposits were 5.17 and 4.50 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. All Bank deposits are uninsured. 
 Accumulated other comprehensive income was 47 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 119 million compared to accumulated other comprehensive loss of 72 million at December 31, 2023, mainly attributable to an improvement in the fair values of investment securities classified as AFS, which primarily reflected higher interest rate spreads during 2024, mostly impacting the Bank s agency MBS portfolio. 
 Credit Ratings. On August 16, 2024, S P Global Ratings (S P) affirmed the long-term issuer credit ratings on all of the FHLBanks at AA+. On February 14, 2024, Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) affirmed the Aaa long-term ratings of the FHLBank System. 
 Changes in the long-term credit ratings of individual FHLBanks do not necessarily affect the credit rating of the consolidated obligations issued on behalf of the FHLBanks. Rating agencies may change or withdraw a rating from time to time because of various factors, including operating results or actions taken, business developments, or changes in their opinion regarding, among other factors, the general outlook for a particular industry or the economy. 
 
 Advances-Related Products. The advances-related products consist of advances and other credit products. 
 The following table presents the advances portfolio by product type at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 (1) Partial prepayment symmetry (PPS) and full prepayment symmetry (FPS) are product features under which the Bank may charge the borrower a prepayment fee or pay the borrower a prepayment credit, depending on certain circumstances, such as movements in interest rates, when the advance is prepaid. In November 2018, the Bank discontinued offering advances with PPS, and any prepayment credit on an advance with PPS would be limited to the lesser of 10 of the par value of the advance or the gain recognized on the termination of the associated interest rate swap, which may also include a similar contractual gain limitation.

 Mortgage-Related Products. The mortgage-related products consist of MBS investments and mortgage loans acquired through the Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF Program Mortgage Partnership Finance and MPF are registered trademarks of the FHLBank of Chicago). 
 MBS Investments The Bank s MBS portfolio was 15.9 billion and 15.3 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank s MBS portfolio increased primarily because of 804 million in purchases, a 191 million increase in basis adjustments, and a 122 million increase in the fair values of MBS investments classified as AFS, partially offset by 498 million in principal repayments. 
 Mortgage Loans Mortgage loan balances were 707 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 47 million from 754 million at December 31, 2023. Average mortgage loans were 734 million for the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 60 million from 794 million for the first nine months of 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Bank s financial strategies are designed to enable the Bank to expand and contract its balance sheet as membership composition and member credit needs change. The Bank s liquidity and capital resources are designed to support its financial strategies. The Bank s primary source of liquidity is its access to the debt capital markets through consolidated obligation issuance which is described in Item 1. Business Funding Sources in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. The Bank s status as a GSE is critical to maintaining its access to the capital markets. Although consolidated obligations are backed only by the financial resources of the FHLBanks and are not guaranteed by the U.S. government, the capital markets have traditionally treated the FHLBanks consolidated obligations as comparable to federal agency debt, providing the FHLBanks with access to funding at relatively favorable rates. The maintenance of the Bank s capital resources is governed by its capital plan. 
 Liquidity 
 The Bank seeks to maintain the liquidity necessary to repay maturing consolidated obligations for which it is the primary obligor, meet other obligations and commitments, meet expected and unexpected member credit demands, and avail of investment opportunities. The Bank monitors its financial position in order to meet these objectives. 
 The Bank generally manages operational, contingent, and refinancing risks using a portfolio of cash and short-term investments and access to the debt capital markets. In addition, the Bank maintains alternate sources of funds, detailed in its contingency funding plan, which also includes an explanation of how sources of funds may be allocated under stressed market conditions, such as short-term operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance or short-term disruptions in the debt capital markets. The Bank maintains cash deposits, short-term and high-quality money market investments, and government securities in amounts to satisfy these requirements and objectives. 
 The Finance Agency has established base case liquidity guidelines, which may be amended from time to time, that each FHLBank maintain sufficient liquidity at least equal to its anticipated cash outflows, assuming no new consolidated obligation issuance, renewal of all maturing advances, a specified percentage drawdown on letters of credit balances, and certain U.S. Treasury investments as a source of funds. The Finance Agency s guidance provides that base case liquidity should generally be maintained for 10 to 30 days. The Bank actively monitors and manages refinancing risk. Finance Agency s guidance specifies tolerance levels related to the size of each FHLBank s funding gaps to measure refinancing risk as the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period, expressed as a percentage of total assets. The guidance limits three-month and one-year funding gaps generally between the range of 10 to 20 and 25 to 35 , respectively. 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 Funding gaps are measured at monthend, using the average ratio for the three most recent month ends. The Bank is also required to perform an annual liquidity stress test and report the results to the Finance Agency. 
 The Bank s liquidity management plans also describe meeting obligations in a market or operational disruption scenario that may prevent the issuance of new consolidated obligations by, for example, (i) allowing short-term liquid investments to mature, (ii) using eligible securities as collateral for repurchase agreement borrowings, (iii) borrowing on a short-term unsecured basis from other financial institutions (federal funds purchased) or other FHLBanks (inter-FHLBank borrowings), and if necessary, (iv) allowing advances to mature without renewal. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Bank held total sources of funds in an amount that would have allowed the Bank to meet its liquidity needs without issuing new consolidated obligations for over 10 days, in accordance with the Finance Agency s guidance. The Bank met all expected and unexpected member demand using its liquidity in a safe and sound manner. In addition, the Bank s funding gap positions as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were within the tolerance levels provided by the Finance Agency s guidelines. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had 45 million in commitments to issue consolidated obligations. The Bank had no commitments to issue consolidated obligations at December 31, 2023. 
 For more information, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Liquidity Risk in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Bank engages in financial transactions that, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), are not recorded on the Bank s Statements of Condition or may be recorded on the Bank s Statements of Condition in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transactions. For example, the Bank routinely enters into commitments to extend advances and issues standby letters of credit. These commitments and standby letters of credit may represent future cash requirements of the Bank, although the standby letters of credit usually expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting and collateral requirements as advances made by the Bank. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Bank had 19.1 billion and 19.4 billion in standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no advance commitments outstanding. 
 For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies. 
 Capital 
 On April 11, 2024, the Bank submitted to the Finance Agency an application of proposed amendments to its capital plan. On September 4, 2024, the Finance Agency issued its approval of the application of proposed amendments. On November 1, 2024, the Bank issued a member communication notifying members that these proposed amendments will become effective November 15, 2024. The amendments to the Bank's capital plan primarily provide the Bank s Board the option to establish two subclasses of stock for the potential purpose of enabling the declaration of different dividend rates on Membership and Activity stock. The Bank is still assessing the potential establishment of two subclasses of stock and has made no determination at this time. Without further action by the Board, there is no impact on member stock holdings or stock purchase requirements resulting from the amendments to the capital plan. 
 The preceding summary of the amendments to the Bank s capital plan is not a complete description. For detail, refer to the capital plan included herein as an exhibit. The Bank s capital requirements and proposed amendments are discussed in detail in Item 1. Financial Statements Note 9 Capital in this report, Item 7.

 Risk Management 
 The Bank has an integrated corporate governance and internal control framework designed to support effective management of the Bank s business activities and the risks inherent in these activities. As part of this framework, the Board has adopted a Risk Governance Policy that outlines the key roles and responsibilities of the Board and management and sets forth how the Bank is organized to achieve its risk management objectives, including the implementation of the Bank s strategic objectives, risk management strategies, corporate governance and standards of conduct. The policy also establishes an independent risk oversight function to identify, assess, measure, monitor, and report on the enterprise risk profile in relation to its risk appetite and risk management capabilities of the Bank. For more information, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Advances. The Bank manages the credit risk of advances and other credit products by setting the credit and collateral terms available to individual members and housing associates based on their creditworthiness and on the quality and value of the assets they pledge as collateral. Pursuant to the Bank s lending agreements with its borrowers, the Bank limits extensions of credit to individual borrowers to a percentage of the market value or unpaid principal balance of the borrower s pledged collateral, known as the borrowing capacity, which the Bank can change from time to time. The borrowing capacity percentage varies according to several factors, including the charter type of the institution, the collateral type, the value assigned to the collateral, the results of the Bank s collateral field review of the borrower s collateral, the pledging method used for loan collateral (specific identification or blanket lien), the amount of loan data provided (detailed or summary reporting), the data reporting frequency (monthly or quarterly), the borrower s financial strength and condition, and any institution-specific collateral risks. Under the terms of the Bank s lending agreements, the aggregate borrowing capacity of a borrower s pledged eligible collateral must meet or exceed the total amount of the borrower s outstanding advances, other extensions of credit, and certain other borrower obligations and liabilities. 
 For more information on the Bank s management of credit risk on its advances, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk Advances in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The Bank has a high concentration of advances with certain institutions and their affiliates. The percentage of the Bank s advances outstanding to its top 10 borrowers and their affiliates decreased to 66 , or 32.2 billion, at September 30, 2024, compared to 71 , or 43.8 billion, at December 31, 2023. 
 Several of the Bank s top 10 advance borrowers and their affiliates at the end of 2022 were involved in voluntary liquidation, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) receivership during 2023, or have been acquired by nonmember institutions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonmembers accounted for 17.1 billion, or 35 , and 26.0 billion, or 42 , of total advances outstanding, respectively. Nonmembers accounted for 186 million, or 33 , and 668 million, or 38 , of the Bank s interest income from advances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Because these borrowers are nonmembers, when these advances either mature or are prepaid they cannot be replaced by these borrowers, which will adversely affect the Bank s level of advance balances and total interest income from advances in the future. As a result of the inability of nonmembers to seek new advances, the level of advances and their associated net interest income in the future will be determined by member business, which will be subject to a number of factors including, but not limited to, a member s ability to generate new business to seek new advances, consolidation within the banking industry, and the economy in general.

 (1) Includes advances, letters of credit, the market value of swaps, estimated prepayment fees for certain borrowers, and the credit enhancement obligation on MPF loans. 
 (2) Collateral borrowing capacity does not represent any commitment to lend on the part of the Bank. 
 Based on the Bank s credit and collateral policies, its credit analysis of borrowers financial condition and the collateral pledged as security for advances, the Bank expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the advances. Therefore, no allowance for credit losses on advances is deemed necessary by the Bank as of September 30, 2024. The Bank has never experienced any credit losses on advances. 
 Securities pledged as collateral are assigned borrowing capacities that reflect the securities market valuations and market liquidation risks. The securities collateral pledged largely consists of agency pools and collateralized mortgage obligations, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. 
 Most institutions may choose to pledge loan collateral by specific identification or under a blanket lien. Insurance companies, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), and housing associates are required to pledge loan collateral by specific identification with monthly reporting. All other borrowers pledging by specific identification must provide a detailed listing of all the loans pledged to the Bank on a monthly basis. 
 The Bank may require certain de novo institutions (chartered within the last three years), insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates to deliver pledged loan collateral to the Bank. Other considerations for delivery of pledged collateral may include the institution s creditworthiness, satisfactory maintenance of its collateral, and the status of the Bank s priority of security interest. 
 As of September 30, 2024, of the loan collateral pledged to the Bank, 21 was pledged by 23 institutions by specific identification, 44 was pledged by 118 institutions under a blanket lien with detailed reporting, and 35 was pledged by 141 institutions under a blanket lien with summary reporting. For each institution that pledges loan collateral, the Bank conducts loan collateral field reviews on a one-, two-, or three-year cycle, depending on the risk profile of the institution and the types of collateral pledged. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s maximum borrowing capacities as a percentage of the assigned market value of mortgage loan collateral pledged under a blanket lien with detailed reporting were as follows: 86 for first lien residential mortgage loans, 81 for multifamily mortgage loans, 81 for commercial mortgage loans, and 69 for 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 second lien residential mortgage loans. The maximum borrowing capacity for small business, small agribusiness, and small farm loans was 50 of the unpaid principal balance, although most of these loans are pledged under blanket lien with summary reporting, with a maximum borrowing capacity of 25 . The highest borrowing capacities are available to institutions that pledge under a blanket lien with detailed reporting because the detailed loan information allows the Bank to assess the value of the collateral more precisely and because additional collateral is pledged under the blanket lien that may not receive borrowing capacity but may be liquidated to repay advances in the event of default. The Bank may review and change the maximum borrowing capacity for any type of loan collateral at any time. 
 The following table presents the mortgage loan collateral pledged at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 (1) The unpaid principal balance for loan participations is 100 of the outstanding loan amount. The borrowing capacity for loan participations is based on the participated amount pledged to the Bank. 
 The Bank holds a security interest in subprime residential mortgage loans pledged as collateral by members and by nonmembers. Subprime loans are defined as loans with a borrower FICO score of less than or equal to 660 at origination, or if the original FICO score is not available, as loans with a current borrower FICO score of less than or equal to 660. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the unpaid principal balance of these loans totaled 5.6 billion and 3.7 billion, respectively. The Bank reviews and assigns borrowing capacities to subprime mortgage loans as it does for all other types of loan collateral, taking into account the known credit attributes in the pricing of the loans. All advances, including those made to borrowers pledging subprime mortgage loans, are required to be fully collateralized. The Bank limits the amount of borrowing capacity that may be supported by subprime collateral. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the borrowing capacity of these loans totaled 3.8 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively. 

Investments. The Bank has adopted credit policies and exposure limits for investments that promote risk limitation, diversification, and liquidity. These policies determine eligible counterparties and restrict the amounts and terms of the Bank s investments with any given counterparty according to the Bank s own capital position as well as the capital and creditworthiness of the counterparty.

 (2) Does not reflect changes in ratings, outlook, or watch status occurring after September 30, 2024. These ratings represent the lowest rating available for each unsecured investment owned by the Bank, based on the ratings provided by Fitch, Moody s, or S P. The Bank s internal rating may differ from this rating. 
 The Bank s MBS investments include PLRMBS and agency residential MBS, which are backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. Some of the PLRMBS were issued by or purchased from members, former members, or their affiliates. The Bank has investment credit limits and terms for these investments that do not differ for members and nonmembers. Regulatory policy limits total MBS investments, to three times the Bank s regulatory capital at the time of purchase. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s MBS portfolio was 218 of Bank regulatory capital (as determined in accordance with regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks). 
 The Bank executes all MBS investments without preference to the status of the counterparty or the issuer of the investment as a nonmember, member, or affiliate of a member. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s investment in MBS had gross unrealized losses totaling 50 million, 25 million of which were related to PLRMBS. These gross unrealized losses related to PLRMBS were primarily attributable to market expectations of the credit performance of loan collateral underlying these securities, which caused these assets to be valued at discounts to their amortized cost. 
 For its agency MBS, the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities because the Bank determined that the strength of the issuers guarantees through direct obligations or support from the U.S. government is sufficient to protect the Bank from losses. As a result, the Bank determined that, as of September 30, 2024, all of the gross unrealized losses on its agency MBS are temporary. 
 If conditions in the housing and mortgage markets and general business and economic conditions deteriorate, the fair value of MBS may decline further, and the Bank may experience additional credit losses on PLRMBS in future periods. Additional credit losses could adversely affect the Bank s earnings and retained earnings and its ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock. The Bank cannot predict whether it will be required to record an allowance for credit losses on its PLRMBS in the future. 
 
 Derivative Counterparties. The Bank has adopted credit policies and exposure limits for uncleared derivatives counterparty credit exposure. Interest rate exchange agreements may be either uncleared or cleared at a clearing house. 
 Uncleared Derivatives The Bank s uncleared derivatives activity is subject to uncleared derivatives regulatory requirements mandating the exchange of variation margin and initial margin if exposure to a counterparty exceeds certain specified thresholds. The Bank selects only highly rated derivative dealers and major banks (derivative 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 dealer counterparties) that meet the Bank s eligibility criteria to act as counterparties for its uncleared derivative activities. In addition, for all uncleared derivative transactions, the Bank has entered into master netting agreements and credit support agreements with all its derivative dealer counterparties that provide for delivery of margin to limit the Bank s net unsecured credit exposure to these counterparties. Under these policies and agreements, the amount of unsecured credit exposure to an individual derivative dealer counterparty is set at zero (subject to a minimum transfer amount). 
 Additional information related to uncleared margin rules for uncleared derivative transactions are included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Derivatives and Hedging Activities in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The Bank is subject to the risk of potential nonperformance by its counterparty in a derivative transaction. A counterparty must deliver or return variation margin to the Bank if the total unsecured exposure to that counterparty exceeds the minimum transfer amount. In addition, if an initial margin threshold is exceeded, the Bank will post and collect initial margin to further protect against potential counterparty nonperformance. 
 As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivative transactions with counterparties as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cleared Derivatives In a cleared derivatives transaction, the Bank is subject to nonperformance by the clearing house and its futures commission merchant or clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial margin and settle variation margin through a clearing agent to the clearing house exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk if its futures commission merchant, or clearing agent, fails to meet its obligations. The use of a clearing house, or central counterparty, lowers overall credit risk exposure because it employs standard valuation and initial and variation margin processes and is specifically designed to withstand remote but plausible futures commission merchant default credit events. Variation margin is settled for changes in the value of the portfolio, and initial margin is posted for changes in risk profile of the portfolio. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of September 30, 2024. 
 The increase or decrease in the credit exposure net of cash collateral, from one period to the next, may be affected by changes in several variables, such as interest rates, the size and composition of the portfolio, market values of derivatives, and accrued interest. Based on the master netting arrangements, its credit analyses, and the collateral requirements in place with each counterparty, the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on its derivative agreements. 
 The following table presents the Bank s credit exposure to its derivative dealer counterparties at September 30, 2024.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if applicable, and the reported amounts of income, expenses, gains, and losses during the reporting period. Changes in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions could potentially affect the Bank s financial position and results of operations significantly. Although the Bank believes these judgments, estimates, and assumptions to be reasonably accurate, actual results may differ. 
 In the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K, the following accounting policies and estimates were identified as critical because they require the Bank to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies and estimates are: accounting for derivatives; and estimating fair values of investments classified as trading and AFS, derivatives and associated hedged items carried at fair value in accordance with the accounting for derivative instruments and associated hedging activities, and financial instruments carried at fair value under the fair value option. 
 There have been no significant changes in the judgments and assumptions made during the first nine months of 2024 in applying the Bank s critical accounting policies. These policies and the judgments, estimates, and assumptions are also described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Bank s 2023 Form 10-K and in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11 Fair Value.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 Annual Designation of Member Director and Independent Director Positions. On June 21, 2024, the Finance Agency designated one member director position for Arizona, five for California, and one for Nevada, to be effective January 1, 2025, with the California allocation going from six positions in 2024 to five positions in 2025. In addition, the Finance Agency designated six independent director positions for the Bank to be effective in 2025, with the allocation going from seven positions in 2024 to six positions in 2025. One of the California member director positions, and two of the independent director positions (one of which is designated as a public interest director position), for the term ending on December 31, 2025, will be filled through an election of the members located in California (for the California member director position) and an election of all members of the Bank (for the two independent director positions). The elections for terms ending December 31, 2025, will be held in the fourth quarter of 2024. The California member director position and the two independent director positions will each have a four-year term that begins on January 1, 2025. 
 Certain legislative and regulatory actions and developments are summarized in this section. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legislative and Regulatory Developments in Bank s 2023 Form 10-K, and in the Bank s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024, for a description of certain legislative and regulatory developments that occurred prior to the publication of those reports. 
 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Member Credit Risk Management. 
 On September 27, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the Finance Agency s 
 expectations that an FHLBank s underwriting and credit decisions should not rely solely on the collateral securing the member s credit obligations and instead reflect, among other factors, a member s financial condition. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBanks to implement policies for credit risk 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 governance, member credit assessment, and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of escalation policies, processes for coordination with members prudential regulators, and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. The Bank is evaluating this advisory bulletin in relation to its current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess its potential impact on the Bank and its operations. 
 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank System Climate-Related Risk Management. 
 On September 30, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the FHFA s expectation that each FHLBank should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework over time. The advisory bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate, monitor, and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the board of directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBanks to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the advisory bulletin on the Bank and its operations. 
 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for FHLBanks. 
 On October 3, 2024, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024, to amend the Finance Agency s regulation on capital requirements (Capital Regulation) to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBanks. The proposed rule would include interest-bearing deposit accounts (IBDAs) in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits with approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations, and clarify that certain non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment, or other transactional accounts) are to be considered unsecured extensions of credit subject to the Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general unsecured credit limit could provide greater flexibility for an FHLBank s liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to the Bank s current business processes. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on the Bank and its operations. 
 Proposed Rule on FHLBank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management. 
 On October 21, 2024, the Finance Agency proposed revisions to its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The comment deadline will be 90 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (1) impact director compensation by allowing the Director of the Finance Agency to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (2) require the Bank to complete and submit background checks to the Finance Agency on every nominee for a directorship; (3) impact public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (4) expand the list of qualifying experiences for all independent directors to include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, CDFIs, business models, and modeling; and (5) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing directors for cause. Other proposed revisions address, among other things, Bank conflicts of interest policies, covering all Bank employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management and record retention. 
 While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practice, several of the proposed revisions could result in significant changes to the nomination, election, and retention of the Bank s Board. Additional

 director eligibility requirements and limitations on and potential reductions or limitations to director compensation resulting from the proposed rule could hinder the Bank s ability to recruit and retain the talent and expertise that are critical to the Bank s ability to satisfy its mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. The Bank continues to analyze the impact that the proposed rule could have on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is defined as the risk to the Bank s market value of capital and future earnings (excluding the impact of any cumulative net gains or losses on derivatives and associated hedged items and on financial instruments carried at fair value) as a result of movements in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors (market rate factors). This profile reflects the Bank s objective of maintaining a conservative asset-liability mix and its commitment to providing value to its members through products and dividends without subjecting their investments in Bank capital stock to significant market risk. 
 The Bank s Risk Appetite Framework includes a market risk management objective aimed at maintaining a relatively low adverse exposure of the market value of capital and future earnings (excluding the impact of any cumulative net gains or losses on derivatives and associated hedged items and on financial instruments carried at fair value) to changes in market rate factors. 
 Market risk identification and measurement are primarily accomplished through market value of capital sensitivity analyses and projected earnings and adjusted net interest income as a percent of the capital sensitivity analyses. The Risk Appetite Framework approved by the Bank s Board establishes market risk limits and market risk measurement standards at the product level. Additional guidelines approved by the Bank s Enterprise Risk Committee apply to the Bank s advances-related products and mortgage-related products. These guidelines provide limits that are m onitored at the product level and are consistent with the Bank s Risk Appetite Framework. Market risk is managed for each product regularly. Compliance with Bank limits and guidelines is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis, along with a corrective action plan if applicable. 
 Market Value of Capital Sensitivity The Bank uses m arket value of capital sensitivity (the interest rate sensitivity of the net fair value of all assets, liabilities, and interest rate exchange agreements) as an important measure of the Bank s exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 The Bank s market value of capital sensitivity risk limits for the potential adverse impact of an instantaneous parallel shift of a plus or minus 100-basis-point change in interest rates from current rates (base case) is no worse than a 3.0 change in the estimated market value of capital. In addition, the risk limits for the potential adverse impact of an instantaneous plus or minus 100-basis-point change in interest rates measured from interest rates that are 200 basis points above or below the base case is no worse than 4.0 of the estimated market value of capital. In the case where a market risk sensitivity compliance metric cannot be estimated with a parallel shift in interest rates because of prevailing low interest rates, the sensitivity metric is not reported. The Bank s measured market value of capital sensitivity was within the limits as of September 30, 2024. 
 To determine the Bank s estimated risk sensitivities to interest rates for the market value of capital sensitivity, the Bank uses a third-party proprietary asset and liability system to calculate estimated market values under alternative interest rate scenarios. The system analyzes all of the Bank s financial instruments, including derivatives, on a transaction-level basis using sophisticated valuation models with consistent and appropriate behavioral assumptions and current position data. The system also includes a third-party mortgage prepayment model. 
 At least annually, the Bank reexamines the major assumptions and methodologies used in the model, including valuation methods, discounting curves, and mortgage prepayment assumptions. The Bank also compares the mortgage prepayment assumptions in the third-party model to other sources, including actual mortgage prepayment history.

 The following table presents the sensitivity of the market value of capital (the market value of all of the Bank s assets, liabilities, and associated interest rate exchange agreements, with mortgage assets valued using market spreads implied by current market prices) to changes in interest rates. The table presents the estimated percentage change in the Bank s market value of capital that would be expected to result from changes in interest rates under different interest rate scenarios, using market spread assumptions as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 -1.1 1.1 100 basis-point change (2) 
 +1.1 +1.0 200 basis-point change (2) 
 +2.0 +1.8 
 (1) Instantaneous change from actual rates at dates indicated. 
 (2) Interest rates for each maturity are limited to non-negative rates. 
 The Bank s estimates of the sensitivity of the market value of capital to changes in interest rates as of September 30, 2024, are comparable with the estimates as of December 31, 2023. Compared to December 31, 2023, interest rates as of September 30, 2024, have decreased 59 basis points for the one-month Treasury bill, decreased 25 basis points for the five-year Treasury note, and decreased 6 basis points for the 10-year Treasury note. 
 The Bank s Risk Management Policy provides guidelines for the payment of dividends and the repurchase of excess stock based on the ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock. If this ratio at the end of any quarter is: (i) less than 100 but greater than or equal to 90 , any dividend would be limited to an annualized rate no greater than the daily average of the federal funds effective rate for the applicable quarter (subject to certain conditions), and any excess stock repurchases would not exceed 500 million (subject to certain conditions); (ii) less than 90 but greater than or equal to 70 , any dividend and any excess stock repurchases would be subject to the same limitations and conditions as in (i) above, except that any excess stock repurchases would not exceed 4 of the Bank s outstanding capital stock as of the repurchase date; and (iii) less than 70 , the Bank would not pay a dividend, not repurchase excess stock (but continue to redeem excess stock as provided in the Bank s capital plan), limit the acquisition of certain assets, and review the Bank s risk policies. A decision by the Board to declare or not declare any dividend or repurchase any excess stock is a discretionary matter and is subject to the requirements and restrictions of the FHLBank Act and applicable requirements under the regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks. The ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock was 258 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Net Interest Income as a Percent of Capital The adjusted net interest income as a percent of capital is a non-GAAP measure used by the Bank to assess the impact of interest rate changes on the Bank s projected economic earnings. The measurement is based on current period economic earnings that exclude the effects of unrealized net gains or losses resulting from the Bank s derivatives and associated hedged items and from financial instruments carried at fair value, which will generally reverse through changes in future valuations and settlements of contractual interest cash flows over the remaining contractual terms to maturity or by the call or put date of the assets and liabilities held under the fair value option, hedged assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Economic earnings also exclude the interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
 The Bank s Risk Appetite Framework incorporates a limit on the adverse sensitivity of projected net interest income as a percent of capital. The Bank s net interest income on capital sensitivity limit to the potential adverse impact of an instantaneous parallel shift of a plus or minus 200 basis-point change in interest rates from current rates (base case) to no worse than a -210 basis-points change from the base-case projected net interest income on capital. With the indicated interest rate shifts, the net interest income on capital for the 12-month horizon is projected to remain within the limit of -210 basis-points.

 Duration Gap Duration gap is the difference between the estimated durations (market value sensitivity) of assets and liabilities (including the impact of interest rate exchange agreements) an d reflects the extent to which estimated maturity and repricing cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched. The Bank monitors the duration gap analysis and does not have a risk limit. At September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023, the Bank s assets dur ations exceeded its liabilities durations, as shown in the following table.

 The Bank manages the perfor mance and interest rate risks of the advances-related products and mortgage-related products within prescribed guidelines and policy limits. 
 Advances-Related Products Interest rate risk arises from advances-related products primarily through the use of shareholder-contributed capital and retained earnings to fund fixed rate investments of targeted amounts and maturities. In general, advances result in very little net interest rate risk for the Bank because most fixed rate advances with original maturities greater than three months and all advances with embedded options are simultaneously hedged with an interest rate swap with terms to offset the advance. The interest rate swap generally is maintained as a hedge for the life of the advance. These hedged advances effectively create a pool of variable rate assets, which, in combination with the strategy of raising debt swapped to variable rate liabilities, creates an advances portfolio with low net interest rate risk. 
 Money market investments used for liquidity management generally have maturities of one month or less. In addition, to increase the Bank s liquidity position, the Bank invests in Treasury securities, generally with terms up to four years. These fixed rate investments are swapped to variable rate investments. 
 The interest rate risk in advances-related products is primarily associated with the Bank s strategy for investing capital. The Bank s strategy is generally to invest 50 of capital in short-term (maturities of three months or less) and 50 intermediate-term (laddered maturities of up to four years). However, this strategy may be altered from time to time depending on market conditions. The strategy to invest 50 of capital in short-term assets is intended to mitigate the market value of capital risks associated with the potential repurchase or redemption of excess stock. Excess stock usually results from a decline in a borrower s outstanding advances or by a membership termination. Under the Bank s capital plan, capital stock, when repurchased or redeemed, is required to be repurchased or redeemed at its par value of 100 per share, subject to certain regulatory and statutory limits. The strategy to invest 50 of capital in short to intermediate maturities is intended to take advantage of the higher earnings available from a generally positively sloped yield curve, when intermediate-term investments generally have higher yields than short-term investments. 
 The Bank updates the repricing and maturity gaps for actual asset, liability, and derivative transactions that occur in the advances-related products regularly. The Bank regularly compares the targeted repricing and maturity gaps to the actual repricing and maturity gaps to identify rebalancing needs for the targeted gaps. Periodically, the Bank evaluates the projected impact of expected maturities and scheduled repricing of assets, liabilities, and interest rate exchange agreements on the interest rate risk of the advances-related products. These analyses are used to measure and manage potential reinvestment risk (when the remaining term of advances is shorter than the remaining term of the financing) and potential refinancing risk (when the remaining term of advances is longer than the remaining term of the financing).

 Because of the short-term and variable rate nature of the assets, liabilities, and derivatives of the advances-related products, the Bank s interest rate risk guidelines address the amounts of net assets that are expected to mature or reprice in a given period. The market value sensitivity analyses and net interest income simulations are also used to identify and measure risk and variances to the target interest rate risk exposure in the advances-related products. 
 Mortgage-Related Products The Bank s mortgage assets include MBS, most of which are classified as HTM or AFS, and mortgage loans held for portfolio purchased under the MPF Program. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk from mortgage-related products because the principal cash flows of the mortgage assets and the liabilities that fund them are not exactly matched through time and across all possible interest rate scenarios, given the effect of mortgage prepayments. 
 The Bank manages the interest rate risk and market risk of the mortgage-related products through selected funding and hedging strategies. The total carrying value of MBS and mortgage loans at September 30, 2024, was 16.6 billion, including 15.9 billion in MBS and 708 million in mortgage loans. The total carrying value of MBS and mortgage loans at December 31, 2023, was 16.1 billion, including 15.3 billion in MBS and 755 million in mortgage loans. Floating rate securities, and fixed rate multifamily securities that have been converted to floating rate through the use of interest rate swaps, were 15.4 billion, or 93 , of MBS and mortgage loans at September 30, 2024, and 14.9 billion, or 92 , of MBS and mortgage loans at December 31, 2023. Intermediate and long-term fixed rate assets, whose interest rate and market risks have been partially offset through the use of fixed rate callable debt, fixed rate non-callable debt, and certain interest rate swaps, were 1.1 billion, or 7 , of MBS and mortgage loans, at September 30, 2024, and 1.2 billion, or 8 , of MBS and mortgage loans at December 31, 2023. 
 The estimated market risk of mortgage-related products are managed both at the time an asset is purchased and on an ongoing basis for the total portfolio. At the time of purchase (for all significant mortgage asset acquisitions), the Bank analyzes the estimated earnings sensitivity and estimated market value sensitivity, taking into consideration the estimated mortgage prepayment sensitivity of the mortgage assets and anticipated funding and hedging activities under various interest rate scenarios. The related funding and hedging transactions are executed at or close to the time of purchase of a mortgage asset. 
 At least quarterly, the Bank reviews the estimated market risk profile of the entire portfolio of mortgage assets and related funding and hedging transactions. The Bank then considers rebalancing strategies to modify the estimated mortgage portfolio market risk profile. Periodically, the Bank performs more in-depth analyses, which include an analysis of the impacts of non-parallel shifts in the yield curve and assessments of the impacts of unanticipated mortgage prepayment behavior. Based on these analyses, the Bank may take actions to rebalance the mortgage portfolio s market risk profile. These rebalancing strategies may include entering into new funding and hedging transactions, forgoing or modifying certain funding or hedging transactions normally executed with new mortgage purchases, or terminating certain funding and hedging transactions for the mortgage asset portfolio. 
 The Bank manages the estimated interest rate risk associated with mortgage assets, including mortgage prepayment risk, through a combination of debt issuance and derivatives. The Bank may obtain funding through callable and non-callable FHLBank consolidated obligations and may execute derivative transactions to achieve principal cash flow patterns and market value sensitivities for the liabilities and derivatives that provide a significant offset to the interest rate and mortgage prepayment risks associated with the mortgage assets. Debt issued to finance mortgage assets may be fixed rate debt, callable fixed rate debt, adjustable rate debt, or callable adjustable rate debt. Derivatives may be used as temporary hedges of anticipated debt issuance or long-term hedges of debt used to finance the mortgage assets. The derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk of fixed rate mortgage assets generally may be callable and non-callable pay-fixed interest rate swaps. 
 As discussed above in Market Risk Market Value of Capital Sensitivity, the Bank uses market value of capital sensitivity as a primary market value metric for measuring the Bank s exposure to interest rates. The Bank s interest rate risk limits and guidelines for mortgage-related products address the market value of capital sensitivity of the assets, liabilities, and derivatives of mortgage-related products.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The senior management of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (Bank) is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Bank s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to the Bank s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures, the Bank s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and the Bank s management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of controls and procedures. 
 Management of the Bank has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures with the participation of the president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Bank s president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer have concluded that the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Bank s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank s internal control over financial reporting. 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 Consolidated Obligations 
 The Bank s disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures for accumulating and communicating information in compliance with the Bank s disclosure and financial reporting requirements relating to the joint and several liability for the consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks. Because the FHLBanks are independently managed and operated, the Bank s management relies on information that is provided or disseminated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency), the Office of Finance, and the other FHLBanks, as well as on published FHLBank credit ratings, in determining whether the joint and several liability regulation is reasonably likely to result in a direct obligation for the Bank or whether it is reasonably possible that the Bank will accrue a direct liability. 
 The Bank s management also relies on the operation of the joint and several liability regulation. The joint and several liability regulation requires that each FHLBank file with the Finance Agency a quarterly certification that it will remain capable of making full and timely payment of all of its current obligations, including direct obligations, coming due during the next quarter. In addition, if an FHLBank cannot make such a certification or if it projects that it may be unable to meet its current obligations during the next quarter on a timely basis, it must file a notice with the Finance Agency. Under the joint and several liability regulation, the Finance Agency may order any FHLBank to make principal and interest payments on any consolidated obligations of any other FHLBank, or allocate the outstanding liability of an FHLBank among all remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank s participation in all consolidated obligations outstanding or on any other basis.

 The Board of Directors may impose a Capital Stock Assessment only if it determines that the aggregate of (i) the Minimum Stock Requirements of all Members, (ii) the Minimum Stock Retention Requirements of all Former Members, and (iii) its retained earnings will result in, or will be likely to result in, an amount of Total Capital that is not sufficient for the Bank to meet its Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirement and its Risk Management Policy Minimum. The aggregate amount of any Capital Stock Assessment shall not exceed (i) the amount of Capital Stock necessary to enable the Bank to meet its Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirement, plus (ii) the amount of Capital Stock necessary to enable the Bank to meet its Risk Management Policy Minimum. 
 
 The amount of each Member s Capital Stock Assessment shall be determined by allocating among all Members, in proportion to the number of shares of Capital Stock that then constitutes each Member s Minimum Stock Requirement (specifically excluding any Excess Stock held by any Member or Former Member as of the effective date of the Capital Stock Assessment) before the assessment, the amount of additional Capital Stock necessary to enable the Bank to meet its Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirement and its Risk Management Policy Minimum.

 i. To the extent permitted under the relevant governing agreements between the Bank and the Member (and subject to the payment of any applicable prepayment or termination fee) the Member has reduced the amount of any transactions outstanding between the Bank and the Member, and thereby reduced its Activity-Based Stock Requirement and its Minimum Stock Requirement to a level such that the Member then holds Capital Stock in an amount at least equal to the Member s adjusted Minimum Stock Requirement (including its Capital Stock Assessment) or 
 
 ii.

Upon such determination, the Board of Directors shall declare a pro rata reduction in the number of shares of each Member s Capital Stock Assessment, based upon the number of shares of Capital Stock that are no longer required to enable the Bank to meet its Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirement and its Risk Management Policy Minimum. The number of shares subtracted from each Member s Capital Stock Assessment shall immediately be deemed to be Excess Stock of that Member to the extent that the Member otherwise holds sufficient Capital Stock to meet its Minimum Stock Requirement (including any portion of the Capital Stock Assessment continuing in effect). 
 
 The Bank, in its sole discretion (subject to the regulatory oversight of the Finance Agency) may limit the amount of Capital Stock that any Member may own to that amount necessary for the Member to meet its Minimum Stock Requirement.

The Bank shall not Redeem or Repurchase any Capital Stock if, following the Redemption or Repurchase, the Bank would fail to satisfy its Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirement and its Risk Management Policy Minimum or the Member would fail to maintain its Minimum Stock Requirement. Further, the Bank shall not Redeem or Repurchase any Capital Stock if prohibited from doing so by any Regulation or Finance Agency order. 
 
 If, upon expiration of the Redemption Period applicable to any Capital Stock, the Bank is unable to Redeem the Capital Stock because (i) following the Redemption, the Bank would fail to satisfy its Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirement or (ii) the Bank is otherwise prohibited from doing so by Regulation or Finance Agency order, Redemption shall occur in accordance with the provisions of Section XI.

 4. Voluntary Cancellation of Charter 
 
 If a Member s charter is cancelled pursuant to a self-liquidation ending its corporate existence or other voluntary action by the Member, then the Member s Membership in the Bank shall automatically terminate, and the Redemption Period for the Capital Stock then held by the Member that is not subject to a pending Redemption notice shall be deemed to begin, on the date on which the Member s charter is cancelled.

All Repurchase payments for a given calendar quarter made pursuant to this Section XI.C. shall be made on the same business day. 
 
 D. No Priority for Notices of Redemption or Repurchase in the Event of Liquidation 
 
 In the event that the Finance Agency determines to liquidate the Bank, from and after the date of any such determination, all of the Capital Stock held by the Members, whether or not subject to a notice of Redemption or Repurchase, shall thereafter be treated exactly the same, and no further Redemptions or Repurchases shall occur except in connection with the liquidation of the Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Regulations, and this Capital Plan.

The Bank shall not Redeem or Repurchase any Capital Stock that is required to meet the Member s Activity-Based Stock Requirement or the Former Member s Activity-Based Stock Retention Requirement until after the relevant Indebtedness or transactions have been extinguished or settled. The Bank shall have the right to collect any dividends and other proceeds of Capital Stock otherwise payable to a Member or Former Member in default to satisfy any monetary obligations of the Member or Former Member to the Bank or, in the sole discretion of the Bank (subject to the regulatory oversight of the Finance Agency), to pay any dividends to the Member or Former Member in Capital Stock. 
 
 C. Prepayment Fees

 B. Funding of Account 
 
 1. Date on Which Allocation Begins 
 
 The Bank shall allocate to its Restricted Retained Earnings account an amount at least equal to the Regular Contribution Amount beginning on the REFCORP Termination Date. The Bank shall allocate amounts to the Restricted Retained Earnings Account only through contributions from its Quarterly Net Income or Adjustments to Prior Net Income occurring on or after the REFCORP Termination Date, but nothing in the Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment shall prevent the Bank from allocating a greater percentage of its Quarterly Net Income or positive Adjustment to Prior Net Income to its Restricted Retained Earnings account than the percentages set forth in the Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment.

 In the event the Bank sustains a Net Loss for a calendar quarter, the following shall apply (i) to the extent that its cumulative calendar year-to-date net income is positive at the end of such quarter, the Bank may decrease the amount of its Restricted Retained Earnings so that the cumulative addition to the Restricted Retained Earnings account for the calendar year-to-date at the end of such quarter is equal to 20 percent of the amount of such cumulative calendar year-to date net income (ii) to the extent that its cumulative calendar year-to-date net income is negative at the end of such quarter (a) the Bank may decrease the amount of its Restricted Retained Earnings so that the cumulative addition to the Restricted Retained Earnings account for the calendar year-to-date at the end of such quarter is zero, and (b) the Bank shall apply any remaining portion of the Net Loss for the calendar quarter first to reduce Retained Earnings that are not Restricted Retained Earnings until such Retained Earnings are reduced to zero, and thereafter may apply any remaining portion of the Net Loss for the calendar quarter to reduce Restricted Retained Earnings and (iii) for any subsequent calendar quarter in the same calendar year, the Bank may decrease the amount of its quarterly allocation to its 
 Capital Plan Effective December 14, 2020 November 15, 2024 Page 25 

Restricted Retained Earnings account in that subsequent calendar quarter such that the cumulative addition to the Restricted Retained Earnings account calendar year-to-date is equal to 20 percent of the amount of cumulative calendar year-to-date net income. 
 
 In the event the Bank sustains a Net Loss for a calendar year, any such Net Loss first shall be applied to reduce Retained Earnings that are not Restricted Retained Earnings until such Retained Earnings are reduced to zero, and thereafter any remaining portion of the Net Loss for the calendar year may be applied to reduce Restricted Retained Earnings. 
 
 4. Funding at the Special Contribution Amount 
 
 If during a Dividend Restriction Period, the amount of the Bank s Restricted Retained Earnings decreases in any calendar quarter, except as provided in Sections XV.B.3(i) and (ii)(a) above, the Bank shall allocate the Special Contribution Amount to its Restricted Retained Earnings account beginning at the following calendar quarter-end (except as provided in the last sentence of this Section XV.B.4.). Thereafter, the Bank shall continue to allocate the Special Contribution Amount to its Restricted Retained Earnings account until the cumulative difference between (i) the allocations made using the Special Contribution Amount and (ii) the allocations that would have been made if the Regular Contribution Amount applied, is equal to the amount of the prior decrease in the amount of its Restricted Retained Earnings account arising from the application of Section XV.B.3.(ii)(b). If at any calendar quarter-end the allocation of the Special Contribution Amount would result in a cumulative allocation in excess of such prior decrease in the amount of Restricted Retained Earnings (i) the Bank may allocate such percentage of Quarterly Net Income to the Restricted Retained Earnings account that shall exactly restore the amount of the prior decrease, plus the amount of the Regular Contribution Amount for that quarter and (ii) the Bank in subsequent quarters shall revert to paying at least the Regular Contribution Amount. 
 
 5. Release of Restricted Retained Earnings 
 
 If the Bank s RREM decreases from time to time due to fluctuations in the Bank s Total Consolidated Obligations, amounts in the Restricted Retained Earnings account in excess of 150 percent of the RREM may be released by the Bank from the restrictions otherwise imposed on such amounts pursuant to the provisions of the Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment, and reallocated to its Retained Earnings that are not Restricted Retained Earnings. Until the Restriction Termination Date, the Bank may not otherwise reallocate amounts in its Restricted Retained Earnings account (provided that a reduction in the Restricted Retained Earnings account following a Net Loss pursuant to Section XV.B.3. is not a reallocation). 
 
 6. No Effect on Rights of Shareholders as Owners of Retained Earnings 
 
 In the event of the liquidation of the Bank, or a taking of the Bank s Retained Earnings by any future federal action, nothing in the Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment shall change the rights of the holders of the Bank s Class B stock that confer ownership of Retained Earnings, including Restricted Retained Earnings, as granted under Section 6(h) of the Act. 

XVI. Limitation on Dividends, Stock Purchase and Stock Redemption 
 
 A. General Rule on Dividends 
 
 From the REFCORP Termination Date through the Restriction Termination Date, the Bank may not pay Dividends, or otherwise reallocate funds (except as expressly provided in Section XV.B.5., and further provided that a reduction in the Restricted Retained Earnings account following a Net Loss 
 Capital Plan Effective December 14, 2020 November 15, 2024 Page 26 

pursuant to Section X.V.B.3. is not a reallocation), out of Restricted Retained Earnings. During a Dividend Restriction Period, the Bank may not pay Dividends out of the amount of Quarterly Net Income required to be allocated to Restricted Retained Earnings.

XVII. Termination of Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment Obligations 
 
 A. Notice of Automatic Termination Event 
 
 1. Action by FHLBanks 
 
 If the Bank elects to assert that an Automatic Termination Event has occurred (or will occur on the effective date of a change in a statute or the Regulations), the Bank shall provide prompt written notice to all of the other FHLBanks (and provide a copy to the Finance Agency) identifying the specific statutory or regulatory change that is the basis for the assertion. For the purposes of this Section, prompt written notice means notice delivered no later than 90 calendar days subsequent to (1) the date the specific statutory change takes effect or (2) the date an interim final rule or final rule effecting the specific regulatory change is published in the Federal Register. 
 
 If within 60 calendar days of transmission of such written notice to all of the other FHLBanks, at least 2 3 of the then existing FHLBanks (including the Bank) execute a Declaration of Automatic Termination concurring that the specific statutory or regulatory change identified in the written notice constitutes an Automatic Termination Event, then the Declaration of Automatic Termination Event shall be delivered by the Bank to the Finance Agency within 10 calendar days of the date that the Declaration of Automatic Termination is executed. After the expiration of a 60 calendar day period that begins when the Declaration of Automatic Termination is delivered to the Finance Agency, or is delivered to the Finance Agency by another FHLBank pursuant to the terms of its capital plan, an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be deemed to occur (except as provided in Section XVII.A.3.). 
 
 If a Declaration of Automatic Termination concurring that the specific statutory or regulatory change identified in the written notice constitutes an Automatic Termination Event has not been executed by at least the required 2 3 of the then existing FHLBanks within 60 calendar days of transmission of such notice to all of the other FHLBanks, the Bank may request a determination from the Finance Agency that the specific statutory or regulatory change constitutes an Automatic Termination Event. Such request must be filed with the Finance Agency within 10 calendar days after the expiration of the 60 calendar day period that begins upon transmission of the written notice of the basis of the assertion to all of the other FHLBanks. 
 
 2. Action by Finance Agency 
 
 The Bank may request a determination from the Finance Agency that a specific statutory or regulatory change constitutes an Automatic Termination Event, and may claim that an Automatic Termination Event has occurred, or will occur, with respect to a specific statutory or regulatory change only if the Bank has complied with the time limitations and procedures of Section XVII.A.1. above. 
 Capital Plan Effective December 14, 2020 November 15, 2024 Page 1 

If within 60 calendar days after the Bank delivers such a request to the Finance Agency, or another FHLBank delivers such a request pursuant to its capital plan, the Finance Agency provides the requesting FHLBank with a written determination that a specific statutory or regulatory change is an Automatic Termination Event, then an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be deemed to occur as of the expiration of such 60 calendar day period (except as provided in Section XVII.A.3.). The date of the Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be as of the expiration of such 60 calendar day period (except as provided in Section XVII.A.3.) no matter on which day prior to the expiration of the 60 calendar day period the Finance Agency has provided its written determination. 
 
 If the Finance Agency fails to make a determination within 60 calendar days after an FHLBank delivers such request to the Finance Agency, then an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be deemed to occur as of the date of the expiration of such 60 calendar day period (except as provided in Section XVII.A.3.) provided, however, that the Finance Agency may make a written request for information from that FHLBank, and toll such 60 calendar day period from the date that the Finance Agency transmits its request until that FHLBank delivers to the Finance Agency information responsive to its request. 
 
 If within 60 calendar days after an FHLBank delivers to the Finance Agency a request for determination that a specific statutory or regulatory change constitutes an Automatic Termination Event (or such longer period if the 60 calendar day period is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence) the Finance Agency provides that FHLBank with a written determination that a specific statutory or regulatory change is not an Automatic Termination Event, then an Automatic Termination Event shall not have occurred with respect to such change. 
 
 3. Occurrence of Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date 
 
 In no case under this Section XVII.A. may an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date be deemed to occur prior to (1) the date the specific statutory change takes effect or (2) the date an interim final rule or final rule effecting the specific regulatory change is published in the Federal Register. 
 
 B. Notice of Voluntary Termination 
 
 If the FHLBanks terminate the Agreement, then the Bank and the other FHLBanks shall provide written notice to the Finance Agency that the FHLBanks have voted to terminate the Agreement. 
 
 C. Consequences of Automatic Termination Event or Vote to Terminate the Agreement 
 
 1. Consequences of Voluntary Termination 
 
 In the event the FHLBanks deliver written notice to the Finance Agency that the FHLBanks have voted to terminate the Agreement, then without any further action by the Bank or the Finance Agency (i) the date of delivery of such notice shall be an Allocation Termination Date and (ii) one year from the date of delivery of such notice shall be a Restriction Termination Date. 
 
 2. Consequences of an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date 
 
 If an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date has occurred, then without further action by the Bank or the Finance Agency (i) the date of the Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be an Allocation Termination Date and (ii) one year from the date of the Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be a Restriction Termination Date. 
 
 Capital Plan Effective December 14, 2020 November 15, 2024 Page 28
