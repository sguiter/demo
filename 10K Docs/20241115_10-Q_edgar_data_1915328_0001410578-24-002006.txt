All activity from inception through September 30, 2024 relates to our formation and initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering ), and, since the completion of the Initial Public Offering, our search for a target to consummate a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of an initial business combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the Trust Account ). We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.

 of 184,221, offset by interest income, unrealized earnings and dividend income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 5,047,581, dividends and interest on cash and cash equivalents of 32,918. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, we had 26,702 in cash and cash equivalents held outside of the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of 1,047,973 (excluding cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account and the deferred underwriter fee payable). Until the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was from the 25,000 of proceeds from our sponsor s purchase of Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, and a loan of 237,234 from our sponsor pursuant to a promissory note to cover certain expenses. The promissory note was repaid in full on January 18, 2023. Following our Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units (the Private Units to the sponsor, a total of 146,625,000 was placed in the Trust Account. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 2,483,194. Net income of 2,125,673 was adjusted by 357,521 changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by investing activities was 72,193,038 related to proceeds from redemption of marketable securities held in Trust Account of 75,921,158, offset by the purchase of marketable securities held in Trust Account of 450,470, as well as dividends received from and reinvestment of marketable securities of 3,277,650.

We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less deferred underwriting fees and income taxes payable), to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital shares or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 26,702 held outside the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. We may need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial business combination. We expect to incur significant costs related to identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year from the date that the financial statements accompanying this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units of the post-business combination entity at a price of 10.00 per unit, at the option of the lender. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any outstanding working capital loans. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2024.

 The underwriters of the Initial Public Offering are entitled to a deferred discount of 0.35 per Unit, or 5,406,250 in the aggregate. The deferred discount will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates as of September 30, 2024. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which provides for additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate reconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature and jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual jurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2023-09 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (who serve as our principal financial and accounting officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, management believes that our system of disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10 - K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness related to the fact that we have not yet designed and maintained effective controls relating to the accounting for offering costs related to the Company s initial public offering. Specifically, certain accounting costs incurred through December 31, 2022 not directly or incrementally related to the initial public offering were incorrectly recorded as deferred offering costs rather than expensed as incurred. During 2023, we implemented a remediation plan, which included a control that our principal financial officer performing additional post-closing review procedures including consulting with subject matter experts related to the accounting for certain offering expenses. The Company completed testing over the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant control and concluded the material weakness was remediated as reported in the Company s March 31,2024 Form 10-Q. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
