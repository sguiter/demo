Rapidbuilt and Sky s strategic partnership has resulted in a standard set of proprietary prototype hangar designs, which are intended to deliver high-quality business aviation facilities, lower construction costs, minimize development risk, expedite permit issuance, and facilitate the implementation of refinements across Sky s portfolio. The Company had pre-existing relationships with Rapidbuilt through a vendor agreement entered into in July 2022 to acquire construction materials related to the Company's development projects (the Rapidbuilt Vendor Agreement and a revolving line of credit loan and security agreement (the Rapidbuilt Loan Agreement to fund the working capital requirement of Rapidbuilt.

The Company s ground leases at airports are classified as operating leases under ASC Topic 842. Management has determined that it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise its options to renew the leases, and therefore the renewal options are included in the lease term and the resulting ROU asset and operating lease liability balances. As the Company s lease agreements do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, nor is the rate available to the Company from its lessors, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. In addition to the Company s ground leases, the Company has operating leases for office space and ground support vehicles, and finance leases for vehicles supporting operations at Rapidbuilt. 
 
 The Company s lease population does not include any residual value guarantees. The Company has operating leases that contain variable payments, most commonly in the form of common area maintenance and operating expense charges, which are based on actual costs incurred. These variable payments were excluded from the calculation of the ROU asset and operating lease liability balances since they are not fixed or in-substance fixed payments. These variable payments were not material in amount for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Some of the leases contain covenants that require the Company to construct the hangar facilities on the leased grounds within a certain period and spend a set minimum dollar amount. For one of the leases, the shortfall (if any) must be paid to the lessor. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies . 
 
 The Company s ground leases have remaining terms ranging between to years, including options for the Company to extend the terms. These leases expire between 2040 and 2097, which include all lease extension options available to the Company. Certain of the Company's ground leases contain options to lease additional parcels of land at the Company's option within a specified period of time. 
 
 In March 2024, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a ground lease agreement (the SJC Lease at SJC with the City of San Jose. The SJC Lease covers approximately 7 acres of property that contains an approximately square foot hangar, approximately square feet of office space, and approximately square feet of apron and ramp space. The property at SJC includes additional land on which the Company intends to develop approximately square feet of additional hangar space. The initial term of the SJC Lease will be years from May 1, 2024, and contains a mutual option to extend the SJC Lease an additional years following the expiration of the initial term. 
 
 In March 2024, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a ground lease agreement (the ORL Lease at ORL with the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority GOAA ). The ORL Lease covers a parcel containing approximately acres of land at ORL. The initial term of the ORL Lease will be years from expiration of construction period, with lease payments commencing contemporaneously with the term. The ORL Lease contains options exercisable by the Company to extend the ORL Lease an additional years based on the Company's total expenditures in subsequent phases at ORL. 
 
 In May 2024, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a ground lease agreement (the IAD Lease at IAD with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority MWAA ). The IAD Lease covers approximately acres of property at IAD. The initial term of the IAD Lease will be approximately years and expire on March 31, 2074, and contains an option exercisable by the Company to extend the IAD Lease an additional years following the expiration of the initial term. The property covered by the IAD Lease is split between two parcels, with rent payments associated with the first parcel IAD Phase I commencing the earlier of certificate of occupancy or 36 months from the issuance of permits for IAD Phase I, and rent payments associated with the second parcel IAD Phase II commencing the earlier of issuance of permits for IAD Phase II or five years from certificate of occupancy associated with IAD Phase I. The IAD Lease requires the Company to commence construction related to IAD Phase II within five years of the receipt of the certificate of occupancy for IAD Phase I. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a ground lease agreement (the SLC Lease at Salt Lake City International Airport SLC with the Salt Lake City Corporation. The SLC Lease covers approximately acres of property at SLC. The initial term of the SLC Lease will be years from the earlier of certificate of occupancy or 24 months from the expiration of the diligence period, as defined in the SLC Lease, with lease payments commencing contemporaneously with the term. The SLC Lease contains two options exercisable by the Company to extend the SLC Lease for an additional years following the expiration of the initial term.

 The Company leases the hangar facilities that it constructs or rents from municipal landlords to third -party tenants. These leases have been classified as operating leases. The Company does not have any leases classified as sales-type or direct financing leases. Lease agreements with tenants are either on a month-to-month basis or have a defined term with an option to extend the term.

 Overview and Background 
 
 We are an aviation infrastructure development company building the first nationwide network of home basing hangar campuses for business aircraft. We develop, lease, and manage general aviation hangars across the United States, targeting airfields in markets with significant aircraft populations and high hangar demand. Our home basing hangar campuses feature exclusive private hangars and a full suite of dedicated services specifically optimized for home-based, versus transient, aircraft. 
 
 The physical footprint of the U.S. business aviation fleet grew by almost 28 million square feet in the ten years preceding the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with hangar supply lagging dramatically, especially in key growth markets. As the fleet of private jets in the United States continues to grow, with recent new aircraft deliveries exceeding retirements, demand for hangar space is at a premium in part because new jets require more square footage of hangar space and the pace of new hangar construction has lagged behind the demand. The cumulative square footage of the business aircraft fleet in the United States increased 50 between 2010 and 2021. Moreover, over that same period, there was an 81 increase in the square footage of larger private jets those with greater than a 24-foot tail height. A recent study conducted by a business aircraft manufacturer forecasted that business aircraft will only continue to grow in the next ten years, with up to 8,500 new business jet deliveries worth over 275 billion expected to be delivered between 2024 and 2033, further supported by data from the major business aviation manufacturers that suggest the current order backlog for new business aviation aircraft is over 49 billion. 
 
 These larger footprint aircraft do not fit in much of the existing hangar infrastructure and impose stacking challenges and constraints in the traditional shared or community hangars operated by FBOs. The addition of winglets (the vertical extensions on aircraft wingtips) on most modern business jets inhibits wing-over-wing storage. Aircraft hangars are in high demand and short supply, with some airports compiling waiting lists that can exceed several years.

Table of Contents 

We believe our scalable, real estate-centric business model is uniquely optimized to capture this market opportunity and address the increased imbalance between the supply and demand for private jet storage. We intend to capitalize on the existing hangar supply constraints at major U.S. airports by targeting high-end tenants in markets where there is a shortage of private and FBO hangar space, or where such hangars are or are becoming obsolete. 
 
 We expect to realize economies of scale in construction through a prototype hangar design replicated at our hangar campuses across the United States. This allows for centralized procurement, straightforward permitting processes, efficient development processes, and the best hangar in business aviation. Unlike a service company, our revenues are mostly derived from long-term rental agreements, offering stability and forward visibility of revenues and cash flows. This allows the Company to fund its development through the public bond market, providing capital efficiency and mitigating refinance risk. 
 
 We seek to develop our home basing hangar campuses on long-term ground leases (or sub-leases thereof) at airports with suitable infrastructure serving metropolitan centers across the United States. We lease each of our properties under long-term ground leases.

 Our projections associated with the commencement and completion of construction, estimated total construction cost, hangars, and rentable square footage of our properties in development are inherently subjective and require judgement to estimate. We believe that our estimates of construction costs and timelines are subject to variability based on various factors including, but not limited to, changes in anticipated site plans, hangar mix, hangar specifications, executed guaranteed maximum price construction contracts, and general market conditions. 

(2) 
 We have not yet formed preliminary estimates regarding the projected construction timeline, total construction costs, or hangar mix associated with our POU Phase II development project.

Recent Developments 
 
 In August 2024, we entered into the SLC Lease at SLC with the Salt Lake City Corporation. The SLC Lease covers approximately 8.4 acres of property at SLC. The initial term of the SLC Lease will be 30 years from the earlier of certificate of occupancy or 24 months from the expiration of the diligence period, as defined in the SLC Lease, with lease payments commencing contemporaneously with the term. The SLC Lease contains two options exercisable by us to extend the SLC Lease for an additional 20 years following the expiration of the initial term. Under the terms of the SLC Lease, we are required to make minimum capital improvements of 40 million. 
 
 In September 2024, we entered into the 2024 Private Placement Purchase Agreement with the Initial Investors, pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to sell and issue to the Initial Investors at an initial closing an aggregate of 3,352,106 Initial PIPE Shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 31.8 million. In October 2024, the Additional Investors each executed a joinder to the 2024 Private Placement Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Additional Investors agreed to purchase, and the Company agreed to sell, an aggregate of 603,684 additional shares of Class A Common Stock at the Initial Closing for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 5.7 million. The Initial Closing of the 2024 Private Placement Purchase Agreement occurred in October 2024, and we sold 3,955,790 First Closing PIPE Shares to the Investors at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 37.6 million. 
 
 Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Our revenues are derived from rents we earn pursuant to the lease agreements we enter into with our tenants. Our ability to expand through new ground leases and tenant leases at airports is integral to our long-term business strategy and requires that we identify and consummate suitable new ground leases or investment opportunities in real estate properties for our portfolio that meet our investment criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. Our ability to enter into new ground leases and tenant leases on favorable terms, or at all, may be adversely affected by a number of factors. We believe that the business environment of the industry segments in which our tenants operate is generally positive for tenants. However, our existing and potential tenants are subject to economic, regulatory and market conditions that may affect their level of operations and demand for hangar space, which could impact our results of operations. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2023, a tenant renting two hangars at OPF made the determination that it was necessary to change its business plans in the greater Miami market, which ultimately resulted in the negotiated settlement of the tenant s lease with us and their exit from our OPF hangar campus. Accordingly, we actively monitor certain key factors, including changes in those factors (fuel prices, new aircraft deliveries, hangar rental rates) that we believe may provide early indications of conditions that may affect the level of demand for new leases and our lease portfolio. See Risks Related to our Business and Operations within the Form 10-K for more information about the risks related to our tenants and our lease payments. 
 
 Ground Lease Expense 
 
 One of our largest expenses is the lease payments under our ground leases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating lease expense for ground leases was 6.0 million and 2.8 million, respectively. We elect to expense rather than capitalize ground lease expense incurred at hangar campus sites under development and will incur expense under U.S. GAAP regardless of whether our ground leases defer cash rent payments until completion of construction. As we enter into new ground leases at new airport sites, our ground lease expense and associated cash payments to airport landlords will ultimately continue to increase into the future. If airport landlords increase the per acre cost of the ground lease of our target campuses, the operating margins at potential target developments may be impacted negatively. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies contributed to rising interest rates, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs. While benchmark interest rates have been reduced and additional reductions are expected in the coming quarters, we do not yet know the level of such reductions and the ultimate impact on our borrowing costs. We expect to issue additional debt to finance future site developments and elevated interest rates would impact our overall economic performance. In addition, we are subject to credit spreads demanded by fixed income investors. As a non-rated issuer, increases in general of credit spreads in the market, or for us, may result in a higher cost of borrowing in the future. We intend to access the bond market on an opportunistic basis. In addition, we may hedge against rising benchmark interest rates by entering into hedging strategies with high quality counterparties. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 The general and administrative expenses reflected in our statement of operations are reflective of the professional, legal and consulting fees, payroll costs, and other general and administrative expenses, including those necessary to support our business as a public company such as expenses associated with corporate governance, SEC reporting, and other compliance matters. While we expect that our general and administrative expenses will rise in some measure as our portfolio of campuses grows, we expect that such expenses as a percentage of our portfolio will decrease over time due to efficiencies, economies of scale, insourcing of job functions, and cost control measures.

Construction Material Costs and Labor 
 
 When constructing our home basing hangar campuses, we use various materials, assemblies, and labor components. We contract for our materials and labor with various general contractors under guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contracts upon receipt of building permits. This allows us to mitigate certain inflationary pressures associated with increases in certain building materials and labor costs between the time construction begins at a hangar campus and the time it is completed. Typically, the materials and most of the components used to construct our hangar campuses are readily available in the United States. We continue to monitor the supply markets and ensure robust competition to achieve the best prices available. Typically, the price changes that most significantly influence our operations are price increases in steel, concrete, and labor. We believe that recent inflationary pressures and market conditions will lead to continued increases in construction costs and market rental rates for hangars within our development projects. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the lease rates for the hangars within our hangar campuses to absorb these increased costs and/or delays, if at all. 
 
 In May 2023, we acquired a controlling interest in Rapidbuilt, a metal building and hangar door manufacturer, that we expect will ultimately result in an increase in quality and a reduction in the overall cost of the metal building and hangar door components at future development projects. We expect that over time this vertical integration will enable us to deliver metal buildings to most of our development sites in shorter times as compared to the anticipated lead times associated with conventional metal building fabricators. We believe internal building fabrication will provide us opportunities to aggressively target continued schedule compression at most of our development projects in the future. In December 2023, we engaged several structural engineering firms to perform an independent peer review of the hangar buildings designed for our DVT Phase I and APA Phase I development projects. The independent peer reviews determined a significant design defect existed within our prototype hangar building designs that requires retrofitting to both meet and exceed our standards and the respective local building codes. The anticipated retrofitting efforts are also expected to be applied to ADS Phase I, and we project that the aggregate additional cost of such retrofits could total between 26 to 28 million and require an additional three to five months of construction duration for each project impacted. Given the planned design enhancements at our APA Phase I, DVT Phase I, and ADS Phase I development projects, we anticipate that our total construction costs for these projects to each be greater than our original estimates, and outside of the scope of the guaranteed maximum price construction contracts. In March 2024, we funded the increase in estimated costs by contributing 27 million of our corporate cash holdings to SHC, thereby restricting the use of such cash to the project scope of the Series 2021 Bonds. 
 
 Our projections associated with the commencement and completion of construction, estimated total construction cost, hangars, and rentable square footage of our properties in development are inherently subjective and require judgement to estimate. We believe that our estimates of construction costs and timelines are subject to variability based on various factors including, but not limited to, changes in anticipated site plans, hangar mix, hangar specifications, executed guaranteed maximum price construction contracts, and general market conditions. In May 2024, we updated many of our preliminary estimates based on our intention to begin incorporating a larger hangar prototype into our home basing hangar campuses, which is intended to provide an increase in rentable square footage of hangar, office, and lounge space upon completion. This larger hangar prototype requires an increase in construction materials and components, and we expect its incorporation into multiple future development projects will ultimately result in cost savings through the realization of economies of scale. Our updated estimates of total construction costs do not include projections of potential cost reductions due to such efficiencies. We intend to continue to aggressively mitigate inflationary pressures, reduce construction costs to the greatest extent possible, and pursue compressed development schedules. We currently structure our guaranteed maximum price construction contracts with shared savings clauses to incentivize the general contractors to reduce construction costs. No assurance can be given that our cost mitigation strategies will be successful, the costs of our ongoing and future projects will not exceed budgets or the guaranteed maximum price for such projects, or that the completion will not be delayed beyond the projected completion dates. 
 
 Current Capital Requirements and Future Expenditures for Expansion 
 
 We previously funded SHC with over 200 million to fund the two phases at our initial five ground leased airport locations. We maintain the ability to include up to 50 million in new projects outside the original five locations to be funded with a portion of the existing proceeds held by the trustee as long as certain approvals and supplemental consultant reports are provided showing that such new project would result in better coverage of debt service than previously contemplated projects. We exercised this ability utilizing approximately 26 million of the 50 million available and received the requisite approvals and reports in March 2023 with respect to our ADS Phase I development project. 
 
 We previously raised equity capital, along with potential future debt and further equity issuances, including the 2024 Private Placement Purchase Agreement and 2023 Private Placement Purchase Agreement entered into on September 16, 2024 and November 1, 2023, respectively, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Private Placement and Securities Purchase Agreement below, to begin to fund additional airport campuses and reach up to 20 airport campuses over the next several years. We also have the ability to access the capital markets through our ATM Facility and through our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. On average, each future campus is anticipated to be composed of 200,000 rentable square feet and is expected to cost approximately 55 million per campus, with 65 or more to be funded with additional private activity bonds or other indebtedness. All future hangar campus projects are discretionary and require us to identify the appropriate airports with the target hangar demand economics, secure required ground leases and permits, and complete future construction at such sites. 
 
 The cumulative 20 airport site business plan is estimated to cost approximately 1.2 billion, with approximately 65 to 75 anticipated from private activity bonds and the balance with equity or equity-linked financing. Our ability to raise additional equity and/or debt financing will be subject to a number of risks, including our ability to obtain financing upon reasonable terms, if at all, costs of construction, delays in constructing new facilities, operating results, and other risk factors. In the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to raise additional equity capital, creating additional dilution to existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in raising such additional equity capital on favorable terms, if at all. Even if we can obtain such additional equity financing if needed, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in raising such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies: 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Such estimates include assumptions used within impairment analyses, estimated useful lives of depreciable assets and amortizable costs, estimates of inputs utilized in determining the fair value of financial instruments such as warrants, estimates and assumptions related to right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, and estimates and assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 
 Cost of Construction 
 
 Cost of construction on the consolidated balance sheets is carried at cost. The cost of acquiring an asset includes the costs necessary to bring a capital project to the condition necessary for its intended use. Costs are capitalized once the construction of a specific capital project is probable. Construction labor and other direct costs of construction are capitalized. Professional fees for engineering, procurement, consulting, and other soft costs that are directly identifiable with the project and are considered an incremental direct cost are capitalized. We allocate a portion of our internal salaries to both capitalized cost of construction and to general and administrative expense based on the percentage of time certain employees worked in the related areas. Interest costs on the loans and bonds used to fund the capital projects are also capitalized until the capital project is completed. Once a capital project is complete, the cost of the capital project is reclassified to Constructed Assets on the accompanying balance sheet and we begin to depreciate the constructed asset on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the asset or the remaining term of the related ground lease, including expected renewal terms. 
 
 Leases 
 
 We account for leases under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 842, Leases. We determine whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of the contract. ASC Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize operating lease liabilities and right-of-use ROU assets for all leases with terms of more than 12 months on the consolidated balance sheets. We have made an accounting policy election that will keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off our consolidated balance sheets and will result in recognizing those lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When management determines that it is reasonably certain that we will exercise our options to renew the leases, the renewal terms are included in the lease term and the resulting ROU asset and operating lease liability balances. We have elected to not capitalize any interest cost that is implicit within our operating leases into cost of construction on the consolidated balance sheet, but instead, we expense our ground lease cost in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components; we have elected the accounting policy to not separate lease and non-lease components for all underlying asset classes. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 We lease hangar facilities that we construct to third parties. The lease agreements are either on a month-to-month basis or have a defined term and may have options to extend the term. Some of the leases contain options to terminate the lease by either party with given notice. There are no options given to the lessee to purchase the underlying assets. Rental revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases, and includes (i) fixed payments of cash rents, which represents revenue each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and (ii) variable payments of tenant reimbursements, which are recoveries of all or a portion of the common area maintenance and operating expenses of the property and are recognized in the same period as the expenses are incurred. 
 
 The Company evaluates the collectability of tenant receivables for payments required under the lease agreements. If the Company determines that collectability is not probable, the Company recognizes any difference between revenue amounts recognized to date under ASC 842 and payments that have been collected from the lessee, including any additional rent or lease termination fees, as a current period adjustment to rental revenue.

Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 4.1 million, compared to approximately 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.6 million, or 64 , increase was primarily the result of the commencement of operations at SJC during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and the impact of increased occupancy at our BNA and OPF hangar campuses, offset by approximately 0.4 million of net non-recurring adjustments to revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily associated with a negotiated lease termination fee from a former tenant of two hangars at OPF. Revenue associated with our delivery of aircraft fuel increased approximately 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses increased approximately 2.0 million, or 120 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expense is primarily reflective of increased ground lease expense, which increased approximately 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in ground lease expense was driven primarily by a full quarter of expense associated with the ground and hangar lease signed at SJC during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in ground lease expense was also driven by the ground leases signed at PWK, BDL, and POU during the three months ended December 31, 2023, ORL during the three months ended March 31, 2024, IAD during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and SLC during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Salaries, wages, and benefits associated with our campus personnel increased by approximately 0.2 million, primarily driven by a headcount increase associated with the commencement of operations at our SJC hangar campus. Other operating expenses increased by approximately 0.2 million, primarily driven by increased utility, insurance, and other start-up expenses associated with the commencement of operations at our SJC hangar campus. 
 
 Depreciation Expense 
 
 Depreciation expense remained materially consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, general and administrative expenses were approximately 4.6 million and 3.6 million, respectively. The approximately 1.0 million, or 30 , increase was primarily due to an approximately 0.7 million increase in salaries, wages, and other benefits, driven by an increase in corporate headcount and expense recognized associated with our equity compensation programs. Headcount and compensation expenses increased approximately 0.4 million and non-cash equity compensation expense increased approximately 0.3 million. Marketing and other pursuit costs increased by approximately 0.2 million, reflecting our growth strategy in securing airport site acquisitions and potential tenants. 
 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 
 Other expense increased from approximately 1.4 million of income for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 15.8 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to an approximately 17.6 million difference in the mark-to-market adjustment of the outstanding warrants at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. The increase was also partially offset by an approximately 0.3 million increase in other income, primarily due to interest earned on our investments in U.S. Treasuries classified as available for sale.

Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 10.1 million, compared to approximately 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 4.8 million, or 90 , increase was primarily the result of the commencement of operations at our SJC hangar campus and the cumulative impact of certain additional tenant leases in place at our BNA and OPF hangar campuses as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The commencement of operations at our SJC hangar campus together with the increase in occupancy at our OPF and BNA hangar campuses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 resulted in increased rental revenues of approximately 3.8 million. Revenue associated with our delivery of aircraft fuel increased approximately 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses increased approximately 3.9 million, or 76 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expense is primarily reflective of increased ground lease expense, which increased by approximately 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in ground lease expense was driven primarily by two full quarters of operating lease expense associated with the ground and hangar lease signed at SJC during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in ground lease expense was also driven by new ground leases signed at PWK, BDL, and POU during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and at ORL, IAD, and SLC during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Salaries, wages, and benefits associated with our campus personnel increased by approximately 0.4 million, primarily driven by a headcount increase associated with the commencement of operations at our SJC hangar campus in April 2024. 
 
 Depreciation Expense 
 
 Depreciation increased approximately 0.3 million, or 16 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflects a full nine months of depreciation associated with our OPF hangar campus, which opened during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was also partially driven by the placement of additional ground support equipment into service throughout 2023 and 2024 and a full nine months of depreciation related to Rapidbuilt, which was acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, general and administrative expenses were approximately 14.1 million and 10.8 million, respectively. The approximately 3.3 million, or 30 , increase was primarily due to an approximately 3.0 million increase in salaries, wages, and other benefits, driven by an increase in corporate headcount and expense recognized associated with our equity compensation programs. Headcount and compensation expenses increased approximately 1.6 million, and non-cash equity compensation expense increased approximately 1.4 million. 
 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 
 Other expense increased from approximately 0.1 million to approximately 22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an approximately 23.9 million difference in the mark-to-market adjustment of the outstanding warrants at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. The increase was also partially offset by an approximately 1.5 million increase in other income, primarily due to interest earned on our investments in U.S. Treasuries classified as available for sale.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund the construction of new assets, fund working capital and other general business needs. Our primary sources of cash include the potential issuance of equity and debt securities and rental payments from tenants. Our long-term liquidity requirements include lease payments under our ground leases with airport authorities, repaying principal and interest on outstanding borrowings, funding the construction costs of our hangar campus development projects (see Construction Material Costs and Labor ), funding for operations, and paying accrued expenses. 
 
 We believe that we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional private activity bonds and other debt and the issuance of additional equity securities. We also have the ability to utilize our 100 million ATM Facility or otherwise utilize our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to access the capital markets. However, as we have recently become a publicly-traded company, we cannot assure you that we will have access to these sources of capital or that, even if such sources of capital are available, that these sources of capital will be available on favorable terms. Our ability to incur additional debt will depend on multiple factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that are or may be imposed by future lenders. Our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets will depend on multiple factors as well, including general market conditions for real estate companies, our degree of leverage, the trading price of our common stock and debt and market perceptions about our Company. 
 
 Our cash deposits may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and the majority are maintained with a major financial institution with reputable credit.

 Private Activity Bonds 
 
 On September 14, 2021, SHC completed an issuance through the Public Finance Authority (Wisconsin) of 166.3 million of Senior Special Facility Revenue Bonds (Aviation Facilities Project), Series 2021 (the PABs ). The PABs are comprised of three maturities: 21.1 million bearing interest at 4.00 , due July 1, 2036 30.4 million bearing interest at 4.00 , due July 1, 2041 and 114.8 million bearing interest at 4.25 , due July 1, 2054. The Series 2021 Bond that has a maturity date of July 1, 2036 was issued at a premium, and Sky received bond proceeds that were 0.2 million above its face value. The net proceeds from the issuance of the PABs proceeds are being used to (a) finance or refinance the construction of various aviation facilities consisting of general aviation aircraft hangars and storage facilities located and to be located on the SGR site, the OPF site, the BNA site, the APA site, and the DVT site (b) fund debt service and other operating expenses such as ground lease expense during the initial construction period (c) fund deposits to the Debt Service Reserve Fund and (d) pay certain costs of issuance related to the PABs. 
 
 Debt Covenants

To the extent that SHC does not comply with these covenants, an event of default or cross-default may occur under one or more agreements, and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access our leased facilities. The PABs are collateralized on a joint and several basis with the property and revenues of all SHC subsidiaries and their assets financed or to be financed from the proceeds of the PABs. 
 
 Covenants in the PABs require SHC to maintain a debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the relevant documents) of at least 1.25 for each applicable test period, commencing with the quarter ending December 31, 2024.

Operating Activities 

Cash provided by operating activities is significantly influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business. Our working capital consists primarily of cash, receivables from tenants, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued compensation, accrued other expenses, and lease liabilities. The timing of collection of our tenant receivables, and the timing of spending commitments and payments of our accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued payroll and related benefits, all affect these account balances.

Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in operating activities of approximately 6.2 million for the same period in 2023. The 0.4 million increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to an approximately 2.5 million unfavorable change in the Company's working capital position, which was primarily driven by the timing of vendor payments and tenant receipts. The change in working capital position was offset by an approximately 2.1 million decrease in net loss, net of non-cash adjustments. The decrease in net loss, net of non-cash adjustments was primarily driven by an increase in rental revenue and the impact of increases in non-cash operating lease expense and equity-based compensation expense. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our primary investing activities have consisted of payments related to the cost of construction at our various hangar campus development projects and investment in U.S. Treasury Securities. As our business expands, we expect to continue to invest in our current and anticipated future portfolio of hangar campus development projects. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was approximately 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of approximately 2.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of approximately 6.3 million of cash provided by investing activities was driven primarily by an increase of approximately 185.1 million in proceeds received from the Company's available-for-sale investments, and a decrease of approximately 104 million of purchases of held-to-maturity investments. These increases were offset by an increase of approximately 201.5 million of available-for-sale U.S. Treasury purchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Proceeds received from the Company's held-to-maturity investments decreased by approximately 67.0 million and capital expenditures increased by approximately 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Our primary financing activities have consisted of capital raised to fund the growth of our business and proceeds from debt obligations incurred to finance our hangar campus development projects. We expect to raise additional equity capital and issue additional indebtedness as our business grows. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of approximately 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. The approximately 0.7 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by 2.9 million of proceeds received from the exercise of Warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by increases of approximately 1.1 million, 0.8 million, and 0.4 million in payments associated with vested equity awards, loan principal payments, and equity issuance costs, respectively.
