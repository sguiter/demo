 million, with the potential to make milestone payments up to million in the aggregate if certain commercial milestones are met. The milestone payments are based on net sales growth over the two-year period beginning January 1, 2024. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we modified our allocation of the intangible assets acquired in the Palette transaction between our domestic and foreign entities as we identified new facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. As a result, we recorded a measurement period adjustment recognizing a million decrease in the deferred tax liabilities and goodwill. The allocation change also impacted the currency translation of certain assets and liabilities and as a result, we reversed previously recorded foreign currency translation of million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, which decreased comprehensive income in the period. The adjustment did not have a significant impact on our results from operations. 
 We have not reached an agreement on the closing statement adjustments with the seller. However, the measurement period related to this acquisition expired during the fourth quarter, and as a result, any subsequent adjustments to the consideration transferred will be recognized in the reporting period in which they are settled.

 (3) Includes activity primarily related to a restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2022 that was designed to relocate manufacturing operations at certain of our facilities (the "2022 Manufacturing relocation plan") and our 2014, 2018, and 2019 Footprint realignment plans. 
 2024 Footprint realignment plan 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we initiated the "2024 Footprint realignment plan," encompassing several strategic restructuring initiatives. These initiatives primarily include the relocation of select manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations, the optimization of specific product portfolios through targeted rationalization efforts, the relocation of certain integral product development and manufacturing support functions, the optimization of certain supply chain activities and related workforce reductions. The actions under the 2024 Footprint realignment plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.

 We expect the restructuring and restructuring related charges will result in future cash outlays ranging from million to million, with the majority anticipated to occur between 2025 and 2026. Furthermore, we expect to incur million to million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan, with the bulk of these expenses expected to occur during 2024 and 2025.

 As of September 29, 2024, we had a restructuring reserve of million related to this plan, all of which related to termination benefits. 
 2023 Footprint realignment plan 
 During the third quarter of 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations, the outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes and related workforce reductions (the "2023 Footprint realignment plan"). These actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2027.

Substantially all of these charges are expected to be recognized within cost of goods sold. 
 Additionally, we expect to incur million to million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, we incurred million and million under the 2023 Footprint realignment plan in pre-tax restructuring related charges, all of which were recognized in cost of goods sold. As of September 29, 2024, we have incurred aggregate restructuring charges in connection with the 2023 Footprint realignment plan of million. In addition, as of September 29, 2024, we have incurred aggregate restructuring related charges of million with respect to the 2023 Footprint realignment plan, consisting of certain costs that principally resulted from the transfer of manufacturing operations to new locations. 
 As of September 29, 2024, we had a restructuring reserve of million related to this plan, all of which related to termination benefits. 
 2023 Restructuring plan 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan, which primarily involved the integration of Palette into Teleflex and workforce reductions designed to improve operating performance across the organization by creating efficiencies that align with evolving market demands and our strategy to enhance long-term value creation (the 2023 restructuring plan ). The plan is substantially complete and as a result, we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the plan to be immaterial. 
 Impairment charge 
 For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a portion of our operating lease assets stemming from our cessation of occupancy of a specific facility.

 Goodwill related to acquisitions ) ) Currency translation adjustment ) September 29, 2024 
 Our goodwill impairment testing is performed annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year in addition to periods where changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill assets may not be recoverable. impairment charges were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024. We did identify indicators of a potential impairment as of June 30, 2024 related to our Interventional Urology North America reporting unit, included within our Americas operating segment. The indicators of a potential impairment primarily arose from lower than anticipated sales results from our UroLift product line UroLift ), primarily driven by the adverse impact of persistent end-market challenges within the U.S. office site of service. We performed a quantitative impairment test of the reporting unit using both the income and the market approaches, which determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value. The more significant judgments and assumptions in determining the fair value included the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, the expected long-term growth rates and the discount rate used to estimate the present value of the future cash flows. Our assessment indicates that the Interventional Urology North America reporting unit is susceptible to future impairment charges if future revenue is lower than our current expectations, in particular with respect to the adverse impacts stemming from end market conditions related to UroLift, as well as from continuing negative impacts from macroeconomic factors, including increased inflation and higher interest rates. The carrying value of goodwill allocated to the Interventional Urology North America reporting unit as of September 29, 2024 was million.

 The total notional amount for all open foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The total notional amount for all open non-designated foreign currency forward contracts as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. All open foreign currency forward contracts as of September 29, 2024 have durations of months or less. 
 Cross-currency interest rate swaps 
 During 2019, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements with different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate (the "2019 Cross-currency swaps"). Under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreements, we notionally exchanged million at an annual interest rate of for million at an annual interest rate of . The swap agreements are designed as net investment hedges. On February 26, 2024, the agreements related to our 2019 Cross-currency swap with an original maturity date of March 4, 2024 were terminated resulting in million in cash settlement proceeds. 
 On February 26, 2024, we executed separate term cross-currency swap agreements set to expire on February 26, 2027 and February 28, 2029, respectively, to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. Each of the swap agreements had a notional principal amount of million and were designated as a net investment hedge. On April 25, 2024, the cross-currency agreements executed in February 2024 were terminated in response to changes in market conditions, resulting in million in a cash settlement payment and we simultaneously executed new separate term cross-currency swap agreements with the same expiration dates and notional values (together, the "2024 Cross-currency swap agreements"). The cross-currency swap agreements expiring in 2027 include different financial institution counterparties and notionally exchanged million at an annual interest rate of for million at an annual interest rate of . The cross-currency swap agreements expiring in 2029 include different financial institution counterparties and notionally exchanged million at an annual interest rate of for million at an annual interest rate of . Both of the 2024 Cross-currency swap agreements are designated as a net investment hedge. 
 During 2023, we executed cross-currency swap agreements with different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, (the "2023 Cross-currency swaps"). Under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreements, we have notionally exchanged million at an annual interest rate of for million at an annual interest rate of . The swap agreements are designated as net investment hedges and expire on October 4, 2025. 
 In 2023, we entered into a zero cost foreign exchange collar contract that aligns with the notional amount and expiration date of the 2023 Cross-currency swaps. We sold a put option with a lower strike price and bought a call option with a higher strike price to manage the foreign exchange risk related to the final settlement of the million notional cross currency swaps. Upon the execution of the zero cost foreign exchange collar contract, we have de-designated the 2023 Cross-currency swaps and re-designated the combined million notional cross currency swaps and zero cost collar into a new hedging instrument. At redesignation, the existing million notional cross-currency swaps were off-market due to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The off-market value due to interest rates will be amortized ratably into earnings through October 2025 and the off-market

 Valuation Techniques 
 Our financial assets valued based upon Level 1 inputs are comprised of investments in marketable securities held in trust, which are available to satisfy benefit obligations under our benefit plans and other arrangements. The investment assets of the trust are valued using quoted market prices. 
 Our financial assets and liabilities valued based upon Level 2 inputs are comprised of foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements. We use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage foreign currency transaction exposure as well as exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forwards and cross-currency swap agreements by calculating the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities, based on quoted market prices, and taking into account the creditworthiness of the counterparties. 
 Our financial liabilities valued based upon Level 3 inputs are comprised of contingent consideration arrangements pertaining to our acquisitions. 
 Contingent consideration 
 Contingent consideration liabilities, which primarily consist of payment obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of revenue-based goals, but also can be based on other milestones such as regulatory approvals, are remeasured to fair value each reporting period using assumptions including revenue growth rates (based on internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans), revenue volatility, discount rates, probability of payment and projected payment dates. 
 We determine the fair value of certain contingent consideration liabilities using a Monte Carlo simulation (which involves a simulation of future revenues during the earn-out period using management's best estimates) or discounted cash flow analysis. Increases in projected revenues, estimated cash flows and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. Increases in the discount rates in periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements and decreases in the discount rates may have the opposite effect.

The timing, price and actual number of shares of common stock that may be repurchased under the share repurchase authorization will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions and corporate and regulatory requirements. The repurchases may occur in open market transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, in privately negotiated transactions, by direct purchases of common stock or a combination of the foregoing, and the timing and amount of stock repurchased will depend on market and business conditions, applicable legal and credit requirements and other corporate considerations. The authorization of the repurchase program does not constitute a binding obligation to acquire any specific amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. On August 2, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for million of our common stock. Under this agreement, shares of common stock, representing of the million aggregate, were delivered and included in treasury stock during the three months ended September 29, 2024. The initial shares received were calculated based on a price per share of , which was the closing share price of our common stock on August 1, 2024. The total number of shares to be repurchased under the agreement will be based on volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the accelerated share repurchase period. Based on our calculations to date, we expect to receive additional shares of common stock upon final settlement of the agreement, which will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 Teleflex Incorporated we, us, our" and Teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits, improving patient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs. We primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. We market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. Because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. We are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies. 
 We evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. Based on our evaluation, we may identify opportunities to divest businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives. In addition, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further improve our cost structure and enhance our competitive position. We also may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve operating margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions, which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship (in some instances, particularly in Asia, the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through sub-distributors or through new distributors). Distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel. 
 Pension termination 
 In 2023, we began the execution of a plan to terminate the Teleflex Incorporated Retirement Income Plan (the TRIP ), a U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The TRIP is subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), and, therefore, must be terminated in accordance with the requirements of ERISA and the process governed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC ). The termination date of the TRIP was August 1, 2023, which is the date upon which the timing of the requirements for the formal termination process is based. On September 8, 2023, we filed the required notice regarding the TRIP termination with the PBGC. The termination process requires that all TRIP benefits be distributed to participants, beneficiaries and alternate payees or transferred to a group annuity contract or the PBGC. In December of 2023, we made payments to eligible participants, beneficiaries and alternate payees who elected the one-time lump sum distribution option offered in connection with the TRIP termination, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax settlement charge of 45.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we purchased a group annuity contract, using TRIP assets, which resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax settlement charge of 138.1 million. During the third quarter of 2024, we finalized the premiums owed for the group annuity contract, which resulted in a refund of pension trust assets and a corresponding reduction to the pre-tax settlement charge of 5.4 million. The participants, beneficiaries, and alternate payees whose benefits were transferred to the group annuity contract will each receive from such group annuity contract the full value of their benefit that accrued under the TRIP. The assets in the Teleflex Retirement Income Plan Trust exceed the estimated liability for amounts to be transferred to the PBGC for missing participants and beneficiaries surplus plan assets ). In July 2024, we transferred 34.2 million of the surplus plan assets to a suspense account within the Teleflex 401(k) Savings Plan, a qualified defined contribution plan. As of September 29, 2024, the surplus assets contributed to the suspense account are included within prepaid and other current assets and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. These assets are restricted for future use in accordance with our election to use them to fund future employer contributions to participants in the Teleflex 401(k) Savings Plan. 
 Goodwill 
 Our goodwill impairment testing is performed annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year in addition to periods where changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill assets may not be recoverable. No impairment charges were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024. We did identify indicators of a potential impairment as of June 30, 2024 related to our Interventional Urology North America reporting unit, included within our Americas operating segment. The indicators of a potential impairment primarily arose from lower than anticipated sales results from our UroLift product line UroLift ), 
 22 

primarily driven by the adverse impact of persistent end-market challenges within the U.S. office site of service. We performed a quantitative impairment test of the reporting unit using both the income and the market approaches, which determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value. The more significant judgments and assumptions in determining the fair value included the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, the expected long-term growth rates and the discount rate used to estimate the present value of the future cash flows. Our assessment indicates that the Interventional Urology North America reporting unit is susceptible to future impairment charges if future revenue is lower than our current expectations, in particular with respect to the adverse impacts stemming from end market conditions related to UroLift, as well as from continuing negative impacts from macroeconomic factors, including increased inflation and higher interest rates. The carrying value of goodwill allocated to the Interventional Urology North America reporting unit as of September 29, 2024 was 643.9 million. 
 Italian payback measure 
 In 2015, the Italian parliament enacted legislation that, among other things, imposed a payback measure on medical device companies that supply goods and services to the Italian National Healthcare System. Under the measure, companies are required to make payments to the Italian government if medical device expenditures in a given year exceed regional expenditure ceilings established for that year. The payment amounts are calculated based on the amount by which the regional ceilings for the given year were exceeded. In response to decrees issued by the Italian Ministry of Health, the various Italian regions issued invoices to medical device companies, including Teleflex, under the payback measure in the fourth quarter of 2022 seeking payment with respect to excess expenditures for the years 2015 through 2018. Following the issuance of the invoices, we and numerous other medical device companies filed appeals with the Italian administrative courts challenging the enforceability of the payback measure, primarily on the basis that the law was unconstitutional. The Italian administrative courts referred the question regarding the constitutionality of the law to the Italian Constitutional Court, which in July 2024, issued a ruling upholding the law as constitutional. During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 we recognized increases to our reserve, and corresponding reductions to revenue, of 2.0 million and 19.8 million, respectively. The increase in reserves for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 included 13.8 million pertaining to prior years stemming from the July 2024 ruling. As of September 29, 2024, our reserve related to this matter was 35.0 million. Following the ruling of the Italian Constitutional Court, the appeal before the Italian administrative court will proceed with respect to the remaining legal arguments asserted by the appellants with regard to the enforceability of the payback law. 
 Results of Operations 
 As used in this discussion, "new products" are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months, and existing products are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago. Discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired and/or divested businesses or assets (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions and/or divestitures within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition and/or divestiture. In addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from the elimination of the distributor, either through acquisition or termination of the distributor, from the sales channel. All of the dollar amounts in the tables are presented in millions unless otherwise noted. 
 Certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.

 Net revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 18.0 million, or 2.4 , compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a 12.3 million increase in sales of new products and price increases, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of existing products that was primarily driven by decreased sales of our UroLift product within our Americas segment. 
 Net revenues for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 51.3 million, or 2.3 , compared to the prior year period, primarily due to price increases and a 30.5 million increase in sales of new products, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from an increase in our reserves related to the Italian payback measure.

 Gross margin for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 50 basis points, or 0.9 , compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the favorable impact of gross margin attributed to acquired and divested businesses, and price increases. The increases in gross margin were partially offset by the adverse impact of manufacturing inefficiencies and continued cost inflation from macro-economic factors, specifically with respect to labor and raw materials. 
 Gross margin for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 90 basis points, or 1.6 , compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the favorable impact of gross margin attributed to acquired and divested businesses, price increases and the benefits from cost improvement initiatives. The increases in gross margin were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from an increase in our reserves related to the Italian payback measure, continued cost inflation from macro-economic factors, specifically with respect to labor and raw materials, and the adverse impact of manufacturing inefficiencies.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 34.1 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to a benefit recognized in the prior year resulting from decreases in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, higher operating expenses incurred by the acquired Palette business, and higher IT related costs that were primarily driven by our implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning ("ERP") solution. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 71.5 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to a benefit recognized in the prior year resulting from decreases in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, higher operating expenses incurred by the acquired Palette business, higher IT related costs that were primarily driven by our implementation of a new ERP solution and higher performance related employee-benefit expenses.

Pension Settlement Charge 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Pension settlement (benefit) charge (5.4) 132.7 
 For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we recognized a settlement charge of 132.7 million related to our plan to terminate the TRIP resulting from our purchase of a group annuity contract to provide participants, beneficiaries, and alternate payees the full value of their benefit under the plan. For the three months ended September 29, 2024, we finalized the premiums owed for the group annuity contract, which resulted in a refund of pension trust assets and a corresponding reduction to the settlement charge of 5.4 million. 
 Restructuring and impairment charges 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.3 0.2 10.8 4.0 
 Restructuring and impairment charges for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 primarily consisted of termination benefits related to the 2024 Footprint realignment plan (defined below). Moreover, restructuring and impairment charges for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 reflect a 2.1 million impairment charge related to a portion of our operating lease assets stemming from our cessation of occupancy of a specific facility. 
 2024 Footprint realignment plan 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we initiated the "2024 Footprint realignment plan," encompassing several strategic restructuring initiatives. These initiatives primarily include the relocation of select manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations, the optimization of specific product portfolios through targeted rationalization efforts, the relocation of certain integral product development and manufacturing support functions, the optimization of certain supply chain activities and related workforce reductions. The actions under the 2024 Footprint realignment plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2025. 
 We estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2024 Footprint realignment plan of 37 million to 46 million. Of these, it is anticipated that 17 million to 21 million will be incurred in 2024, with the majority of the remaining balance expected to be incurred before the end of 2025. We estimate that 31 million to 38 million of the total charges will result in cash outlays, of which we expect 5 million to 7 million to be disbursed in 2024 and the majority to be disbursed before the end of 2026. Furthermore, we expect to incur 13 million to 16 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan, of which 4 million to 5 million is expected to be incurred during 2024. The majority of capital expenditures are expected to be incurred by the end of 2025. 
 We expect to begin realizing plan-related savings in 2024 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of 12 million to 14 million once the plan is fully implemented. The impact of product rationalization efforts will partially offset the annual pre-tax savings generated by the plan, with the impact beginning in 2024. 
 2023 Footprint realignment plan 
 During the third quarter of 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations, the outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes and related workforce reductions (the "2023 Footprint realignment plan"). We estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the plan of 11 million to 15 million. We expect to achieve annual pretax savings in connection with the 2023 Footprint realignment plan of 2 million to 4 million once the plan is fully implemented. 
 2023 Restructuring plan 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan, which primarily involved the integration of Palette into Teleflex and workforce reductions designed to improve operating performance across the organization by creating efficiencies that align with evolving market demands and our strategy to enhance long-term value creation (the 2023 restructuring plan ). The plan is substantially complete and as a result, we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the plan, if any, to be immaterial.

Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 
 Americas 
 Americas net revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 5.1 million, or 1.2 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to a 10.6 million increase in sales of new products and price increases. The increases in net revenue were partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of existing products, primarily driven by decreased sales of our UroLift product, and to a lesser extent, a decrease from the net impact of acquired and divested businesses. 
 
 Americas net revenues for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 1.7 million, or 0.1 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to a 25.7 million increase in sales of new products and price increases. The increases in net revenue were partially offset by a 33.4 million decrease in sales volumes of existing products, primarily driven by decreased sales of our UroLift product, and a 12.8 million decrease from the net impact of acquired and divested businesses. 
 Americas operating profit for the three months ended September 29, 2024 decreased 22.6 million, or 17.9 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to a benefit recognized in the prior year resulting from decreases in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. The increase in gross profit was attributable to higher sales and price increases, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. 
 Americas operating profit for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 decreased 58.9 million, or 17.3 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to a benefit recognized in the prior year resulting from decreases in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities and operating expenses incurred by the acquired Palette business. 
 EMEA 
 EMEA net revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 7.5 million, or 5.3 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to price increases, 1.9 million of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and revenues generated by the acquisition of Palette. 
 EMEA net revenues for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 23.0 million, or 5.3 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to a 21.4 million increase in sales volumes of existing products and price increases, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from an increase in our reserves related to the Italian payback measure. 
 EMEA operating profit for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 2.8 million, or 15.8 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to lower expenses related to the European Union Medical Device Regulation and an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales and price increases, partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support higher sales. 
 EMEA operating profit for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 16.2 million, or 37.0 compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to lower expenses related to the European Union Medical Device Regulation and an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales and price increases, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Asia 
 Asia net revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 5.1 million, or 5.5 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to 2.0 million in revenues generated by the acquisition of Palette, price increases, sales of new products, and to a lesser extent, an increase in sales volumes of existing products. 
 Asia net revenues for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 10.9 million, or 4.2 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to a 6.9 million increase in sales volumes of existing products, revenues generated by the acquisition of Palette, and to a lesser extent, price increases. The increase in net revenues was partially offset by 5.6 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Asia operating profit for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 0.7 million, or 2.7 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales, partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support higher sales. 
 27 

Asia operating profit for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 decreased 8.9 million, or 12.7 , compared to the prior year period, which was attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support higher sales, an increase in research and development expenses, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales. 
 OEM 
 OEM net revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 increased 0.3 million, or 0.3 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to price increases partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of existing products. The decrease in sales volumes was attributable to a recent decision by a large customer to vertically integrate a component that we previously manufactured on their behalf. Additionally, we have begun to experience delays in orders from certain customers as they increasingly focus on managing inventories. We cannot predict with certainty the timing of customer inventory corrections; however, should the current trend of customers more tightly managing their inventory persist, it may adversely impact future results. 
 OEM net revenues for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 15.7 million, or 6.4 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to a 11.5 increase in sales volumes of existing products and price increases. 
 OEM operating profit for the three months ended September 29, 2024 decreased 2.3 million, or 9.5 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross profit resulting from higher manufacturing costs. 
 OEM operating profit for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased 3.2 million, or 4.8 , compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales and prices increases, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. We have net cash provided by United States based operating activities as well as non-United States sources of cash available to help fund our debt service requirements in the United States. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis. 
 On February 26, 2024, we executed two separate term cross-currency swap agreements set to expire on February 26, 2027 and February 28, 2029, respectively, to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. Each of the swap agreements had a notional principal amount of 250 million and were designated as a net investment hedge. On April 25, 2024, the cross-currency agreements executed in February 2024 were terminated in response to changes in market conditions, resulting in 0.4 million in a cash settlement payment, and we simultaneously executed two new separate term cross-currency swap agreements with the same expiration dates and notional values (together, the "2024 Cross-currency swap agreements"). The cross-currency swap agreements expiring in 2027 include five different financial institution counterparties and notionally exchanged 250 million at an annual interest rate of 4.25 for 233.4 million at an annual interest rate of 2.44 . The cross-currency swap agreements expiring in 2029 include four different financial institution counterparties and notionally exchanged 250 million at an annual interest rate of 4.25 for 233.4 million at an annual interest rate of 2.45 . Both of the 2024 Cross-currency swap agreements are designated as a net investment hedge and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements. We and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement. As a result, we may be required to pay (or be entitled to receive) an amount equal to the difference, on the expiration or earlier termination date, between the U.S. dollar equivalent of the 466.8 million notional amount and the 500 million notional amount. The 2024 Cross-currency swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements. However, we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with nine different counterparties, all of which are large, well-established financial institutions. Based on the U.S. dollar to euro currency exchange rate in effect April 25, 2024, and assuming exchange rates remain constant throughout the terms of the 2024 Cross-currency swap agreements, we would realize a reduction in annual cash interest expense of 9.0 million. 
 On July 30, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 500 million of our common stock. The timing, price and actual number of shares of common stock that may be repurchased under the share repurchase authorization will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions and corporate 
 28 

and regulatory requirements. The repurchases may occur in open market transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, in privately negotiated transactions, by direct purchases of common stock or a combination of the foregoing, and the timing and amount of stock repurchased will depend on market and business conditions, applicable legal and credit requirements and other corporate considerations. The authorization of the repurchase program does not constitute a binding obligation to acquire any specific amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. On August 2, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for 200 million of our common stock. Under this agreement, 678,110 shares of common stock, representing 80 of the 200 million aggregate, were delivered and included in treasury stock during the three months ended September 29, 2024. The initial shares received were calculated based on a price per share of 235.95, which was the closing share price of our common stock on August 1, 2024. The total number of shares to be repurchased under the agreement will be based on volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the accelerated share repurchase period. Based on our calculations to date, we expect to receive additional shares of common stock upon final settlement of the agreement, which will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 435.6 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to 372.4 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023. The 63.2 million increase was primarily attributable to favorable operating results, a decrease in cash outflows from inventories as we continue to moderate our inventory levels, and proceeds from the TRIP termination included within prepaid expenses and other assets. The increases in net cash provided from operating activities were partially offset by higher tax payments. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 76.3 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and primarily consisted of 94.4 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by 18.3 million in net proceeds on swaps designated as net investment hedges. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 302.8 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and primarily consisted of 200.0 million in repurchases of our common stock under the accelerated share repurchase agreement, a 58.4 million reduction in net borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility and 47.8 million in dividend payments. 
 Borrowings 
 The indentures governing our 4.625 Senior Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes and 4.25 Senior Notes due 2028 (the "2028 Notes") contain covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create liens; consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with these requirements. 
 The obligations under our senior credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), the 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions) by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries, and the obligations under the Credit Agreement are (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets owned by us and each guarantor. 
 Summarized Financial Information Obligor Group 
 The 2027 Notes are issued by Teleflex Incorporated (the Parent Company ), and payment of the Parent Company's obligations under the Senior Notes is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by an enumerated group of the Parent Company s subsidiaries (each, a Guarantor Subsidiary and collectively, the Guarantor Subsidiaries ). The guarantees are full and unconditional, subject to certain customary release provisions. Each Guarantor Subsidiary is directly or indirectly 100 owned by the Parent Company. Summarized financial information for the Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries (collectively, the Obligor Group as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 is as follows:

 (1) During 2024, certain existing subsidiaries were designated as Guarantor Subsidiaries and as a result, we recast the prior period comparative summarized financial information. 
 The same accounting policies as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 are used by the Parent Company and each of its subsidiaries in connection with the summarized financial information presented above. The Intercompany column in the table above represents transactions between and among the Obligor Group and non-guarantor subsidiaries (i.e. those subsidiaries of the Parent Company that have not guaranteed payment of the Senior Notes). Obligor investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries and any related activity are excluded from the financial information presented above. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions. 
 In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we provided disclosure regarding our critical accounting estimates, which are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. 
 New Accounting Standards 
 See Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting guidance, including estimated effects, if any, of the adoption of the guidance on our financial statements. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 All statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, will, would, should, guidance, potential, continue, project, forecast, confident, prospects and similar expressions typically are used to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the then-current expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates and forecasts about our business and the industry and markets in which we operate. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers or suppliers; delays or cancellations in 
 30 

shipments; demand for and market acceptance of new and existing products; the impact of inflation and disruptions in our global supply chain on us and our suppliers (particularly sole-source suppliers and providers of sterilization services), including fluctuations in the cost and availability of resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in the production or sterilization of our products, transportation constraints and delays, product shortages, energy shortages or increased energy costs, labor shortages in the United States and elsewhere, and increased operating and labor costs; our inability to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, realize planned synergies and operate such businesses profitably in accordance with our expectations; our inability to effectively execute our restructuring programs; our inability to realize anticipated savings resulting from restructuring plans and programs; the impact of enacted healthcare reform legislation and proposals to amend, replace or repeal the legislation; changes in Medicare, Medicaid and third party coverage and reimbursements; the impact of tax legislation and related regulations; competitive market conditions and resulting effects on revenues and pricing; global economic factors, including currency exchange rates, interest rates, trade disputes, sovereign debt issues, and international conflicts and hostilities, such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; public health epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19; difficulties entering new markets; and general economic conditions. For a further discussion of the risks relating to our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as otherwise explicitly stated by us or as required by law or regulation. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to the information set forth in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 (b) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 31 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability and product warranty, intellectual property, contracts, employment and environmental matters. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had accrued liabilities of 0.7 million and 0.8 million, respectively, in connection with these matters, representing our best estimate of the cost within the range of estimated possible loss that will be incurred to resolve these matters. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies are often determined based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions, including as to the timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including whether, among other things, damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has commenced or is complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute, or procedural or jurisdictional issues; there is uncertainty or unpredictability regarding the number of potential claims; there is the potential to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; there is complexity regarding related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against us, we do not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. 
 Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, established reserves and other resources, we do not believe that any such actions are likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 See the information set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in risk factors for the quarter ended September 29, 2024. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 The following table presents the repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 29, 2024: 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program (1) 
 July 1, 2024 - July 29, 2024 July 30, 2024 - August 29, 2024 (2) 
 678,110 678,110 300,000,000 August 30, 2024 - September 29, 2024 300,000,000 Total 678,110 678,110 
 (1) On July 30, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 500 million of our common stock. As of September 29, 2024, the remaining share repurchase capacity under the program was 300 million. 
 
 (2) On August 2, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (the "ASR Transaction") with Bank of America, N.A. (the Counterparty to repurchase an aggregate of 200 million (the "Repurchase Price") of our common stock. The ASR Transaction was executed under the 500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on July 30, 2024. Under the terms of the ASR Transaction, on August 5, 2024, we paid the Repurchase Price to the Counterparty in exchange for 678,110 shares of our common stock, representing shares with a value of 80 of the total Repurchase Price. The initial shares received, which have been included in treasury stock as of September 29, 2024, were calculated based on a price per share of 235.95, which was the closing share price of our common stock on August 1, 2024. The total number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR Transaction will be based on volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR Transaction, less a discount and subject to customary adjustments. Based on our calculations to date, we expect to receive additional shares of common stock from the Counterparty upon final settlement of the ASR Transaction, which will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources."
