 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 1. 
 
 Russia and Ukraine Conflict - In response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, several countries, including the United States, have imposed economic sanctions and export controls on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. As a result of this conflict, including the aforementioned sanctions and overall instability in the region, in March 2022 we permanently ceased all Company operations in Russia and are currently taking the necessary steps to wind down in the country. 
 We continue to monitor the situation involving Russia and Ukraine and its impact on the rest of our global business. This includes the macroeconomic impact, including with respect to global supply chain issues and inflationary pressures. We reevaluated our financial exposure and made a million adjustment during the period ended March 31, 2024 to reduce the existing reserves. We made no further adjustments through September 30, 2024. To date, impacts have not been material to our business and we do not currently expect that any incremental impact in future quarters, including any financial impacts caused by our cancellation of customer contracts and ceasing of operations in Russia, will be material to the Company. 
 Terminated Acquisition On February 9, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity of Velan Inc., a manufacturer of highly engineered industrial valves. In October 2023, we received notice that the required French foreign investment screening approval was not obtained. As a result, the transaction was terminated. Acquisition related expenses incurred during 2023 associated with the transaction were million. 
 NAF AB Divestiture Effective May 4, 2024, we divested NAF AB, a previously wholly-owned subsidiary and control valves business within our Flow Control Division ("FCD") segment, including the NAF AB facility located in Linkoping, Sweden. The sale included cash paid to the buyer of million and resulted in both a pre-tax and after-tax loss of million recorded in loss on sale of business in the condensed consolidated statements of income in the period ended June 30, 2024. In 2024, through the date of disposition, we recorded revenues of approximately million and an immaterial amount of operating income.

 million, before including closing working capital adjustments and a contingent earnout payment of up to million based on MOGAS achieving certain financial goals for the calendar year ended December 31, 2024. MOGAS, a privately held provider of mission-critical severe service valves and associated aftermarket services, is based in Houston, Texas and has operations primarily in North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe and Asia Pacific. The acquisition was funded using a combination of cash on hand and term loan financing under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. MOGAS's differentiated valve products are expected to enhance our installed base, creating meaningful aftermarket opportunities with the addition of MOGAS's strong brand, heritage, and technical expertise in diverse and attractive end markets, including the growing mining industry. MOGAS's 2023 sales were approximately million. 
 The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations , using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price allocation remains preliminary pending management's valuation assessment. Acquisition related expenses incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively, and are included within selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 million remained outstanding with the supply chain financing partner banks and recorded within accounts payable on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, "Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements." The amendments permit leasehold improvements to be amortized over the useful life of the asset when the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset and the lease is between common control entities. The amendments further allow entities to account for leasehold improvements as a transfer of assets between entities under common control through an equity adjustment when the lessee is no longer in control of the underlying asset. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statements of income or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, "Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method." The amendments allow companies to account for all of their tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Companies can elect to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis rather than unilaterally or on an individual investment basis. The amendments are effective on either a modified retrospective or retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, depending on whether the company elects to evaluate its investments for which it still expects to receive income tax credits or other income tax benefits as of the beginning of the period of adoption or at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statements of income or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented 
 In August 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, "Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement." The amendments require that newly formed joint ventures measure the net assets and liabilities contributed at fair value. Subsequent measurement is in accordance with the requirements for acquirers of

 and of total revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our primary method for recognizing revenue over time is the percentage of completion ("POC") method. If control does not transfer over time, then control transfers at a point in time. For both POC and point-in-time methods, we recognize revenue at the level of each performance obligation based on the evaluation of certain indicators of control transfer, such as title transfer, risk of loss transfer, customer acceptance and physical possession. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time accounted for approximately and of total revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 2, "Revenue Recognition," to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report for a more comprehensive discussion of our policies and accounting practices of revenue recognition. 
 Disaggregated Revenue 
 We conduct our operations through business segments based on the type of product and how we manage the business: 
 Flowserve Pumps Division ("FPD") designs and manufactures custom, highly engineered pumps, pre-configured industrial pumps, pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; and 
 FCD designs, manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of engineered-to-order and configured-to-order isolation valves, control valves, valve automation products and related equipment. 
 Our revenue sources are derived from our original equipment manufacturing and our aftermarket sales and services. Our original equipment revenues are generally related to originally designed, manufactured, distributed and installed equipment that can range from pre-configured, short-cycle products to more customized, highly engineered equipment ("Original Equipment"). Our aftermarket sales and services are derived from sales of replacement equipment, as well as maintenance, advanced diagnostic, repair and retrofitting services ("Aftermarket"). Each of our business segments generate Original Equipment and Aftermarket revenues.

 On September 30, 2024, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations related to contracts having an original expected duration in excess of one year was approximately million. We estimate recognition of approximately million of this amount as revenue in the remainder of 2024 and an additional million in 2025 and thereafter. 
 Contract Balances 
 We receive payment from customers based on a contractual billing schedule and specific performance requirements as established in our contracts. We record billings as accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists. A contract asset represents revenue recognized in advance of our right to bill the customer under the terms of a contract. A contract liability represents our contractual billings in advance of revenue recognized for a contract.

 Restated Credit Agreement will provide greater flexibility and additional liquidity as we continue to pursue our business goals and strategy. Most other terms and conditions under the previous Senior Credit Agreement remained unchanged. 
 Under the terms and conditions of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the interest rates per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, other than with respect to swing line loans are adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Adjusted Term SOFR") plus between to , depending on our debt rating by either Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC ("S P"), or, at our option, the Base Rate (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus between to depending on our debt rating by either Moo dy s or S P. At September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility (under the Senior Credit Agreement) was the Adjusted Term SOFR plus in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR loans and the Base Rate plus in the case of Base Rate loans. In addition, a commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the daily unused portions of the Revolving Credit Facility . The commitment fee will be betw een and of unused amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility depending on our debt rating by either Moody s or S P. The commitment f ee was (per annum) during the period ended September 30, 2024, pursuant to the Senior Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Term Loan (under the Senior Credit Agreement) was Adjusted Term SOFR plus in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR loans and the Base Rate plus in the case of Base Rate loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had million in revolving loans outstanding, compared to no revolving loans outstanding for December 31, 2023. We had outstanding letters of credit of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. After consideration of the outstanding letters of credit as of September 30, 2024, the amount available for borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement was limited to million. As of December 31, 2023, the amount available for borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility was million. We have scheduled repayments of million due in each of the next four quarters on our Term Loan.

 In August 2023, we amended the Company-sponsored qualified defined benefit pension plan in the United States (the "Qualified Plan") for non-union employees to discontinue future benefit accruals under the Qualified Plan and freeze existing accrued benefits effective January 1, 2025. Benefits earned by participants under the Qualified Plan prior to January 1, 2025, are not affected. We also amended the Company-sponsored non-qualified defined benefit pension plan in the United States (the "Non-Qualified Plan") that provides enhanced retirement benefits to select members of management. The Qualified Plan and the Non-Qualified Plan were closed to new entrants effective January 1, 2024, and September 1, 2023, respectively. The amendments resulted in a curtailment of both plans during the year ended December 31, 2023. The curtailment loss incurred and the change in projected benefit obligation was immaterial. 
 million liability as of September 30, 2024, included within accrued liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet to recognize this obligation, with corresponding expense included within cost of sales and SG A in our condensed consolidated statements of income. We expect to issue approximately the same amount of value in the form of restricted shares to an additional group of employees in the United States in 2025. The restricted shares are expected to be subject to three year cliff-vesting.

The effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets in Brazil . The effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the benefits of a tax planning strategy, the release of valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets in Brazil, and the release of valuation allowance on a Section 163(j) carryforward partially offset by the net impact of foreign operations . 
 As of September 30, 2024, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by million from December 31, 2023. With limited exception, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits for years through 2017, state and local income tax audits for years through 2017 or non-U.S. income tax audits for years through 2016. We are currently under examination for various years in Austria, Canada, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, the United States and Venezuela. 
 It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the effective tax rate will be impacted by the resolution of some or all of the matters audited by various taxing authorities. It is also reasonably possible that we will have the statute of limitations close in various taxing jurisdictions within the next 12 months. As such, we estimate we could record a reduction in our tax expense of approximately million within the next 12 months. 
 The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions as of September 30, 2024. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of net deferred tax assets. We assess our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowance. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. It is possible that there may be sufficient positive evidence to release a portion of the remaining valuation allowance in those foreign jurisdictions. Release of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded, which could have a material impact on net earnings. The timing and amount of the potential valuation allowance release are subject to significant management judgment and the level of profitability achieved.

The activities of the 2023 Realignment Programs were identified and implemented in phases throughout 2023 and are continuing into 2024. The realignment activities consist of restructuring and non-restructuring charges. Restructuring charges represent costs associated with the relocation of certain business activities and facility closures and include related severance costs. Non-restructuring charges are primarily employee severance associated with workforce reductions and professional services fees. Expenses are primarily reported in cost of sales ("COS") or SG A, as applicable, in our condensed consolidated statements of income. We currently anticipate a total investment in realignment activities that have been evaluated and initiated of approximately million of which million is estimated to be non-cash. There are certain remaining realignment activities that are currently being evaluated, but have not yet been approved and therefore are not included in the above anticipated total investment. 
 Generally, the aforementioned charges will be paid in cash, except for asset write-downs, which are non-cash charges.

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 Our Company 
 We are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation, nuclear and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services enable customers to achieve their goals. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ("QRCs"), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics and turnkey maintenance programs. We currently have approximately 16,000 employees globally and a footprint of manufacturing facilities and QRCs in more than 50 countries. 
 Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital and operating spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and maintenance spending for aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are relied upon to maximize operating time of many key industrial processes. We continue to invest in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to drive customer investments in our offerings and use of our services to replace or repair installed products. The aftermarket portion of our business also helps provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is primarily served by our network of 155 QRCs (some of which are shared by our two business segments) located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value-added services. It is generally a higher margin business compared to our original equipment business and a key component of our profitable growth strategy.

Table of Contents 

 Our operations are conducted through two business segments that are referenced throughout this MD A: 
 FPD designs and manufactures custom, highly engineered pumps, pre-configured industrial pumps, pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; and 
 FCD designs, manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of engineered-to-order and configured-to-order isolation valves, control valves, valve automation products and related equipment. 
 Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications that provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint, our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively and our shared leadership for operational support functions, such as research and development, marketing, and supply chain. 
 The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, SIHI, INNOMAG, Valtek, Limitorque, Durco and Argus, w hich we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. Our products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more th an 10,000 companies, including some of the world s leading engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. 
 We continuously strive to enhance our global supply chain capability to increase our ability to meet global customer demands and improve the quality and timely delivery of our products over the long-term. Additionally, we continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our business segments to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to meet global customer demands. We also remain focused on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations, through our operational excellence program. The goal of the program, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. 
 In the first quarter of 2023, we identified and initiated certain realignment activities concurrent with the consolidation of our FPD aftermarket and pump operations into a single operating model. This consolidated operating model was designed to better align our go-to-market strategy with our product offerings, enable end-to-end lifecycle responsibility and accountability, and to facilitate more efficient operations. Additionally, we committed to an estimated 50 million in cost reduction efforts to begin in 2023. Collectively, the above realignment activities are referred to as the "2023 Realignment Programs." The activities of the 2023 Realignment Programs were identified and implemented in phases throughout 2023 and are continuing through 2024. 
 MOGAS Industries Acquisition On October 15, 2024, we acquired all of the equity interests of MOGAS Industries, Inc., MOGAS Real Estate and MOGAS Systems Consulting LLC (such entities collectively, "MOGAS"), for a cash purchase price of 290.0 million, before including closing working capital adjustments and a contingent earnout payment of up to 15.0 million based on MOGAS achieving certain financial goals for the calendar year ended December 31, 2024. MOGAS, a privately held provider of mission-critical severe service valves and associated aftermarket services, is based in Houston, Texas and has operations primarily in North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe and Asia Pacific. The acquisition was funded using a combination of cash on hand and term loan financing under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. MOGAS's differentiated valve products are expected to enhance our installed base, creating meaningful aftermarket opportunities with the addition of MOGAS's strong brand, heritage, and technical expertise in diverse and attractive end markets, including the growing mining industry. MOGAS's 2023 sales were approximately 166 million. 
 The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations , using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price allocation remains preliminary pending management's valuation assessment. Acquisition related expenses incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.7 million and 2.8 million, respectively, and are included within selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 
 2024 Outlook 
 We have seen growth from the end-markets we serve and continue to focus on our strategic plan that takes a balanced approach to integrating both short-term and long-term initiatives and aims to accelerate growth through three key areas: diversification, decarbonization, and digitization, the "3D Strategy." Our sales volume is expected to deliver sustainable and healthy growth, while our 2023 Realignment Programs and the new operating model have unlocked gains in organizational efficiency. With our strong backlog and supportive market environment, we expect to deliver annual revenue growth in 2024.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024 , we have cash and cash equivalents of 611.7 million and 615.2 million of b orrowings available under our Senior Credit Agreement. On October 10, 2024, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which includes a 800.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and 500.0 million Term Loan. We do not currently anticipate, nor are we aware of, any significant market conditions or commitments that would change any of our conclusions of the liquidity available to us. We expect the liquidity discussed above coupled with the costs savings measures planned and already in place will further enable us to maintain adequate liquidity over the short-term (next 12 months) and long-term (beyond the next 12 months) . We wi ll continue to actively monitor the credit markets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity and access to capital. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects on operations by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. 
 The activities of the 2023 Realignment Programs were identified and implemented in phases throughout 2023 and are continuing into 2024. We currently anticipate a total investment in realignment activities that have been evaluated and initiated of approximately 123 million of which 37 million is estimated to be non-cash. Based on the activities of the 2023 Realignment Programs initiated to date, we estimate that we recognized cost savings of approximately 89 million through September 30, 2024. Upon completion of the activities of the 2023 Realignment Programs that have been identified and initiated to date, we expect to achieve annualized cost savings in excess of 100 million. Actual savings could vary from expected savings, which represent management's best estimate to date. There are certain remaining realignment activities that are currently being evaluated, but have not yet been approved and therefore are not included in the above anticipated total investment or estimated savings.

 We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer with regard to manufacturing, service or support. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the year-to-date period are excluded from year-to-date bookings. Bookings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 136.1 million, or 12.7 , as compared with the same period in 2023. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately 7 million. The increase was driven by increased customer orders of 60 million in the water management industry, 34 million in the power generation industry, 31 million in the oil and gas industry and 22 million in general industries, partially offset by a decrease of 15 million in the chemical industry. The increase in customer bookings was driven substantially by original equipment bookings.

The increase in SG A was primarily due to 1.7 million of expense related to the MOGAS acquisition, 1.6 million increase in research and development costs, 0.6 million increase in bad debt expense and 0.4 million in one-time U.S. pension plan transition benefit expense, partially offset by 2.5 million of expense related to the terminated Velan acquisition incurred in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur, lower broad-based annual incentive compensation and decreased charges of 0.2 million related to our 2023 Realignment Programs as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 SG A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 6.1 million, or 3.5 , as compared with the same period in 2023. Currency effects provided an increase of less than 1 million. The increase in SG A was primarily due to increased sales volume, 5.0 million increase in research and development costs, 2.8 million of expense related to the MOGAS acquisition, 2.4 million increase in bad debt expense and 0.4 million in one-time U.S. pension plan transition benefit expense, partially offset by decreased charges of 9.0 million related to our 2023 Realignment Programs, 8.5 million of expense related to the terminated Velan acquisition incurred in 2023 that did not recur and lower broad-based annual incentive compensation as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Loss on sale of business for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 13.0 million from zero in 2023 to 13.0 million in 2024 due to the divestiture of NAF AB, a previously wholly-owned subsidiary and control valves business within our FCD segment, including the NAF AB facility located in Linkoping, Sweden. The loss on sale of business is included within charges related to our 2023 Realignment Programs.

 Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.2 million, or 7.4 , as compared with the same period in 2023. The increase included negative currency effects of less than 1 million. The increase was primarily due to 8.9 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by 5.8 million increase in SG A. 
 Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 15.5 million, or 15.8 , as compared with the same period in 2023. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately 1 million. The increase was primarily due to the 34.6 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the 13.0 million loss on sale of business and 6.1 million increase in SG A. 
 Backlog of 814.4 million at September 30, 2024 decreased by 12.4 million, or 1.5 , as compared with December 31, 2023 . Currency effects provided an increase of approximately 2 million. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash Flow and Liquidity Analysis 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Amounts in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash flows provided (used) by operating activities 228.0 131.1 Net cash flows provided (used) by investing activities (54.1) (48.4) Net cash flows provided (used) by financing activities (107.4) (32.1) 
 Existing cash, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our cash balance at September 30, 2024 was 611.7 million as compared with 545.7 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Our cash balance increased by 66.0 million to 611.7 million at September 30, 2024, as compared with December 31, 2023. The cash activity during the first nine months of 2024 included cash provided by operating activities, 82.8 million in dividend payments, 52.2 million in capital expenditures, 45.0 million of payments on our Term Loan and 20.1 million of share repurchases. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash provided by operating activities was 228.0 million, as compared to cash provided of 131.1 million for the same period in 2023. Working capital levels vary from period to period and are primarily affected by our volume of work, and can be impacted by billing schedules on our projects. Cash flows used by working capital accounts increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased cash flows used by or decreased cash flows provided by accounts receivable, contract assets, contract liabilities and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increased cash flows provided by or decreased cash flows used by inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Increases in accounts receivable used 96.4 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.5 million provided for the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 77 days as compared with 71 days as of September 30, 2023. 
 Increases in contract assets used 23.3 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with cash flows used of 10.2 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Decreases in inventory provided 2.9 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with cash flows used of 114.6 million for the same period in 2023 . Inventory turns were 3.5 times at September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.3 times as of September 30, 2023. 
 Increases in accounts payable provided 24.7 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 1.9 million of cash provided for the same period in 2023. Decreases in accrued liabilities used 33.9 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 21.4 million of cash flow provided for the same period in 2023. 
 Increases in contract liabilities provided 8.5 million of cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash flows provided of 15.9 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Cash flows used by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 54.1 million, as compared to cash flows used of 48.4 million for the same period in 2023. Cash outflows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024

 resulted primarily from capital expenditures of 52.2 million, an increase of 4.6 million, and payment for disposition of business of 2.6 million as compared with the same period in 2023. Our capital expenditures are generally focused on strategic initiatives to pursue information technology infrastructure, ongoing scheduled replacements and upgrades and cost reduction opportunities. In 2024, we currently estimate capital expend itures to be between 75 million and 85 million before consideration of any acquisition activity. 
 Cash flows used by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 107.4 million, as compared to 32.1 million of cash flows used for the same period in 2023. Cash outflows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from the 45.0 million of payments on our Term Loan, 82.8 million of dividend payments, 50.0 million of payments on our Revolving Credit Facility and 20.1 million of share repurchases, partially offset by 100.0 million of cash proceeds from our Revolving Credit Facility. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from 30.0 million of payments on our Term Loan, 145.0 million repayments under our Revolving Credit Facility and 78.7 million of dividend payments, partially offset by cash inflows of 230.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an available capacity of 615.2 million on our Senior Credit Agreement, which provided for a 80 0.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of September 13, 2026. On October 10, 2024, we amended and restated our Senior Credit Agreement and entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to (i) retain from the Senior Credit Agreement the 800.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, and the right, subject to certain conditions including a Lender approving such increase, to increase the amount of such Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed 400.0 million, (ii) increase our Term Loan from 300.0 million to 500.0 million, and (iii) extend the maturity date to October 10, 2029. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 15.0 million of our outstanding Term Loan is due to mature in the remainder of 2024 and approximately 59.9 million in 2025. However, under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement signed October 10, 2024, the scheduled repayments due in each of the next four quarters on our Term Loan have been reduced to 9.4 million per quarter. Our borrowing capacity is subject to financial covenant limitations based on the terms of our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and is also reduced by outstanding letters of credit. Our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is committed and held by a diversified group of financial institutions. Refer to Note 6, "Debt and Finance Lease Obligations," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional information concerning our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we contributed 20.0 million to our U.S. pension plan, compared to 2.0 million contributions for the same period in 2023 . At December 31, 2023, our U.S. pension plan was fully funded as defined by applicable law. We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. 
 Considering our current debt structure and cash needs, we currently believe cash flows generated from operating activities combined with availability under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and our existing cash balance will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for our short-term (next 12 months) and long-term (beyond the next 12 months) business needs. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by a decrease in the rate of general global economic growth and an extended decrease in capital spending of our customers, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. See "Financing" and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we hav e 279.9 million of rem aining capacity for Board of Directors approved share repurchases. While we currently intend to continue to return cash through dividends and/or share repurchases for the foreseeable future, any future returns of cash through dividends will be reviewed individually, declared by our Board of Directors at its discretion and implemented by management.

 As of September 30, 2024 , we have cash and cash equivalents of 611.7 million and 615.2 million of borrowings available under our Senior Credit Agreement. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company borrowed on the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes and as of September 30, 2024 had 50.0 million outstanding. We do not currently anticipate, nor are we aware of, any significant market conditions or commitments that would change any of our conclusions of the liquidity available to us. We wi ll continue to actively monitor the credit markets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity and access to capital. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained within this Quarterly Report. Our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements were discussed in "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our 2023 Annual Report. The critical policies, for which no significant changes have occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, include: 
 Revenue Recognition; 
 Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves; 
 Reserves for Contingent Loss; 
 Pension and Postretirement Benefits; and 
 Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets. 
 The process of preparing condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based upon what we believe is the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions. The estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The significant estimates are reviewed quarterly with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 Based on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, we believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This is not to suggest that other general risk factors, such as changes in worldwide demand, changes in material costs, performance of acquired businesses and others, could not adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" below. 
 
 ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
 We have presented the information about pronouncements not yet implemented in Note 1, "Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Words or phrases such as, "may," "should," "expects," "could," "intends," "plans," "anticipates," "estimates," "believes," "predicts" or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which include, without limitation, statements concerning our future financial performance, future debt and financing levels, investment objectives, implications of litigation and regulatory investigations and other management plans for future operations and performance. 
 The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are based on our current expectations, projections, estimates and assumptions. These statements are only predictions, not guarantees. Such forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from what is forecast in such forward-looking statements. Specific factors that might cause such a difference include, without limitation, the following: 
 economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations, including military actions, trade embargoes, epidemics or pandemics or changes to tariffs or trade agreements that could affect customer markets, particularly North African, Latin American, Asian and Middle Eastern markets and global oil and gas producers, and non-compliance with U.S. export/re-export control, foreign corrupt practice laws, economic sanctions and import laws and regulations ; 
 any volatile regional and global economic conditions resulting from a public health emergency on our business and operations; global supply chain disruptions and the current inflationary environment could adversely affect the efficiency of our manufacturing and increase the cost of providing our products to customers ; 
 a portion of our bookings may not lead to completed sales, and our ability to convert bookings into revenues at acceptable profit margins; 
 changes in the global financial markets and the availability of capital and the potential for unexpected cancellations or delays of customer orders in our reported backlog; 
 our dependence on our customers' ability to make required capital investment and maintenance expenditures; 
 if we are not able to successfully execute and realize the expected financial benefits from our restructuring, realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, our business could be adversely affected; 
 the substantial dependence of our sales on the success of the oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management industries; 
 the adverse impact of volatile raw materials prices on our products and operating margins; 
 increased aging and slower collection of receivables, particularly in Latin America and other emerging markets; 
 our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including in hyperinflationary countries such as Venezuela and Argentina; 
 potential adverse consequences resulting from litigation to which we are a party, such as litigation involving asbestos-containing material claims; 
 expectations regarding acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses; 
 the potential adverse impact of an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; 
 our dependence upon third-party suppliers whose failure to perform timely could adversely affect our business operations; 
 the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we operate; 
 environmental compliance costs and liabilities; 
 potential work stoppages and other labor matters; 
 access to public and private sources of debt financing; 
 our inability to protect our intellectual property in the United States, as well as in foreign countries; 
 obligations under our defined benefit pension plans; 
 our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud; 
 the recording of increased deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results; 
 our information technology infrastructure could be subject to service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, which could disrupt our business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information ; and 
 ineffective internal controls could impact the accuracy and timely reporting of our business and financial results. 
 These and other risks and uncertainties are more fully discussed in the risk factors identified in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of our 2023 Annual Report and Part II of this Quarterly Report, and may be identified in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC and/or press releases from time to time. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We have market risk exposure arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements in foreign exchange forward contracts. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but we currently expect our counterparties will continue to meet their obligations given their current creditworthiness. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 A substantial portion of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Almost all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies, which are also their functional currencies. Foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions, denominated in a currency other than our or a non-U.S. subsidiary s functional currency. We recognized net gains (losses) associated with foreign currency translation of 52.9 million and (43.0) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.2 million and (20.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, wh ich are included in other comprehensive income (loss). 
 We employ a foreign currency risk management strategy to minimize potential changes in cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Where available, the use of foreign exchange forward contracts allows us to mitigate transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign exchange forward contracts will help offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Our policy allows foreign currency coverage only for identifiable foreign currency exposures. As of September 30, 2024, we had a U.S. dollar equivalent of 644.5 million in aggregate notional amount outstanding in foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties, as compared with 656.6 million at December 31, 2023. Transactional currency gains and losses arising from transactions outside of our sites functional currencies and changes in fair value of non-designated foreign exchange forward contracts are included in our consolidated results of operations. We recognized foreign currency net gains (losses) of (3.2) million and (12.2) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (2.1) million and (24.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 Based on a sensitivity analysis at September 30, 2024, a 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have impacted our net earnings by approximately 19 million. This calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the U.S. dollar and that there are no indirect effects, such as changes in non-U.S. dollar sales volumes or prices. This calculation does not take into account the impact of the foreign currency exchange forward contracts discussed above. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are party to the legal proceedings that are described in Note 10, "Legal Matters and Contingencies," to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report, and such disclosure is incorporated by reference into this "Item 1. Legal Proceedings." In addition to the foregoing, we and our subsidiaries are named defendants in certain other ordinary routine lawsuits incidental to our business and are involved from time to time as parties to governmental proceedings, all arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of lawsuits or other proceedings involving us and our subsidiaries cannot be predicted with certainty, and the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to such lawsuits or other proceedings cannot be predicted accurately, management does not currently expect the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There are numerous factors that affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, reputation and/or prospects, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, careful consideration should be given to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I and "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II of our 2023 Annual Report, which contain descriptions of significant factors that might cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently projected in the forward-looking statements contained therein. 
 There have been no material changes in risk factors discussed in our 2023 Annual Report and subsequent SEC filings. The risks described in this Quarterly Report filed for the period ended September 30, 2024 , our 2023 Annual Report and in our other SEC filings or press releases from time to time are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties are currently deemed immaterial based on management's assessment of currently available information, which remains subject to change; however, new risks that are currently unknown to us may surface in the future that materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
