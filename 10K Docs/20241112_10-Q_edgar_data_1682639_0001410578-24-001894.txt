 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred net losses of approximately million and million, respectively, and used cash in operations of approximately million and million, respectively. The Company does not have recurring significant revenue and has not yet achieved profitability. The Company expects to continue to incur cash outflows from operations for the near future. The Company expects that it will continue to incur significant research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses and, as a result, it will eventually need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date that these financial statements are issued. Implementation of the Company s plans and its ability to continue as a going concern will depend on many factors, including the Company s ability to successfully commercialize its products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies, or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement its product and service offerings. Additionally, the Company will need to raise further capital, through the sale of additional equity or debt securities. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient recurring revenues or secure additional capital, it may be required to curtail its research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve its cash. and , respectively.

Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. Overview We are an ophthalmic technology company developing and commercializing advanced products leveraging our proprietary Optejet topical ophthalmic medication dispensing platform. The Optejet is especially useful in the treatment of chronic front-of-the-eye diseases due to its ease of use, enhanced safety and tolerability, and potential for superior compliance versus standard eye drops. Together, these benefits may combine to produce better treatment options and outcomes for patients and providers. The company s pre-NDA candidate, MicroPine, is being developed for pediatric progressive myopia, a global epidemic impacting hundreds of millions of children worldwide and representing a multi-billion-dollar addressable market. The company s current commercial portfolio includes clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension, 0.05 , for post-surgical pain and inflammation, and Mydcombi for mydriasis. Eyenovia has also secured licensing and development agreements for additional multi-billion-dollar indications where the Optejet may be advantageous, including dry eye. The ergonomic and functional design of the Optejet allows for horizontal drug delivery and eliminates the need to tilt the head back or the manual dexterity to squeeze a bottle, to administer medications. Drug is delivered in a microscopic array of droplets faster than the blink reflex to help ensure instillation success. The precise delivery of a low-volume columnar spray by the Optejet device minimizes contamination risk with a non-protruding nozzle and self-closing shutter. In clinical trials, the Optejet has demonstrated that its targeted delivery achieves a high rate of successful administration, with 98 of sprays being accurately delivered upon first attempt compared to the established rate reported with traditional eye drops of approximately 50 .

Table of Contents 
 A more physiologically appropriate volume of medication in the range of seven to nine microliters is delivered by the Optejet, which is approximately one-fifth of the 35 to 50 microliter dose typically delivered in a single eye drop. Lower volume of medication exposes the ocular surface to less active ingredient and preservatives, potentially reducing ocular stress and surface damage and improving tolerability. The lower volume also minimizes the potential for drug to enter systemic circulation, with the goal of avoiding some common side effects that are related to overdosing of the eye. We are developing versions of the Optejet with on-board digital technology that records the date and time of each use. These data may be used to provide reminders via Bluetooth to smart devices and to allow healthcare practitioners to monitor usage. This information can then be used by practitioners and health care systems to measure treatment compliance and improve medical decision making. In this way, the Optejet could serve as an extension of the physician s office by providing information that is not currently possible to collect except through the use of diaries. We have also successfully expanded our manufacturing capabilities through a partnership with Coastline International, Inc. located in Tijuana, Mexico, as well as the construction of our new manufacturing facility in Reno, Nevada and the construction of our own fill and finish facility in Redwood City, California. The FDA approved the use of both Coastline International and our Redwood City facility for the production of Mydcombi cartridges, and the use of our Reno facility for the production of technical elements such as the base unit for the Optejet device. MicroLine is our investigational pharmacologic treatment for presbyopia, a non-preventable, age-related hardening of the lens, which causes the gradual loss of the eye s ability to focus on near objects and impairs near visual acuity. We have completed two Phase III studies using our Optejet device. In these studies, patients reported high satisfaction with using the device, and a strong preference over using an eye dropper bottle. Since completing these studies, the market opportunity has markedly deteriorated, and we have chosen to put this program on hold and reallocate our resources towards larger opportunities. When and if the market improves, we have kept open the option to continue development of MicroLine which would include a meeting with the FDA to review our clinical data to date. Mydcombi is the only FDA-approved fixed combination of the two leading mydriatic agents, tropicamide and phenylephrine in the United States and our first FDA-approved product. As an ophthalmic spray delivered with Optejet technology, Mydcombi may present a number of benefits for ophthalmic surgical centers, optometric and ophthalmic offices and patients. Those benefits may include improved cost-effectiveness in centers that employ single-use bottles for mydriasis, more efficient use of office time and resources, and an overall improved doctor-patient experience. We have begun the commercialization of Mydcombi, with the first commercial sale of the product occurring on August 3, 2023 as part of a targeted launch, expanded our launch with the hiring and onboarding of ten sales representatives through September 30, 2024. We received FDA approval for our primary Mydcombi manufacturing facility in February 2024, which we believe will allow us to expand and continue to build our manufacturing operations. On July 24, 2024, we received written comments from the FDA outlining the design of a clinical bridging study to transition Mydcombi into our new Gen-2 Optejet device, which has a significantly lower cost to manufacture than the currently approved product. We are in active discussions with manufacturers of existing and late-stage ophthalmic medications to explore whether development with the Optejet technology can solve unmet medical and business needs. Some of those business needs could include extension of exclusivity under the Optejet patents, improvement in a drug s tolerability profile, or potential improvement in treatment compliance. On August 15, 2023, we entered into a license agreement with Formosa, whereby we acquired the exclusive U.S. rights to commercialize any product related to a novel formulation of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05 (the Formosa Licensed Product ), which was approved by the FDA, for post-operative inflammation and pain after ocular surgery, on March 4, 2024. The Formosa License will remain in effect for ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of a Formosa Licensed Product, unless earlier terminated.

Table of Contents 
 We paid Formosa an upfront payment in an aggregate amount of 2.0 million which consisted of (a) cash in the amount of 1.0 million and (b) 487,805 shares of common stock valued pursuant to the Formosa License Agreement at 1.0 million. We also capitalized 122,945 of transaction costs in connection with the Formosa License. In addition, we agreed to pay Formosa up to 4.0 million upon the achievement of certain development milestones and up to 80 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. The trigger for the initial 2.0 million development milestone payment was FDA approval of the Formosa Licensed Product and the effective date of the acceptance by the Company of the transfer and assignment of the FDA approval, which occurred on March 14, 2024. Based on the achievement of this milestone, we paid Formosa (a) cash in the amount of 1.0 million on April 26, 2024 and (b) 613,496 shares of common stock (calculated pursuant to the Formosa License Agreement at 1.0 million using a five-day volume-weighted average price on March 14, 2024, but valued at 0.4 million on the April 29, 2024 settlement date). The remaining 2.0 million development milestone (to be fully paid in cash) was earned and accrued upon FDA approval, but payment will be triggered on the earlier of twelve months after FDA approval of the Formosa Licensed Product or six months following the first commercial sale of the Formosa Licensed Product. On July 23, 2024, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Senju, under which the companies intend to work to develop EYEN-520, a combination of Senju s corneal epithelial wound healing candidate with our Optejet dispensing technology, as a potential treatment for chronic dry eye disease. The companies plan to request a meeting with the FDA in late 2024, to be followed by execution of a definitive agreement related to the further development of the product and anticipated completion of a Phase 2b study in 2025. If successful, the collaboration agreement could be expanded to bring the product into two Phase 3 studies by 2026. On August 7, 2024, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Formosa under which the companies intend to work to develop EYEN-530, a combination of Formosa s clobetasol propionate ophthalmic solution with our Optejet dispensing technology, as a potential treatment for acute dry eye flare-ups. The companies plan to request a meeting with the FDA in late 2024, to be followed by execution of a definitive agreement related to further development of the product and anticipated initiation of two Phase 3 studies by 2026. On September 26, 2024, we announced the U.S. launch and commercial availability of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05 . On September 18, 2024, we received notice from the Staff of Nasdaq providing notification that the Company s bid price had closed below the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification letter stated that we would be provided 180 calendar days to regain compliance. In order to regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock has to be at least 1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time before March 17, 2025. As of November 11, 2024 the Company has not regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Historically, we have financed our operations principally through equity offerings. We have also generated cash through licensing arrangements and our credit facilities with Leerink Partners and Avenue. However, based upon our current operating plan, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date that our financial statements were issued. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to complete additional licensing or business development transactions or raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities to support our future operations. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and/or take additional measures to reduce costs. Our net losses were 7.9 million and 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit and an accumulated deficit of approximately 4.1 million and 175.4 million, respectively. Financial Overview Revenue and Cost of Revenue Revenue is earned from the sale of our FDA approved products, primarily Mydcombi through September 30, 2024. The first commercial sale of FDA approved products occurred on August 3, 2023 as part of a targeted launch and we expanded our launch with the onboarding of ten sales representatives through September 30, 2024. Cost of sales consists of the cost of the production of the FDA approved products that were sold and the write-down of inventories to net realizable value.

 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses are incurred in connection with the research and development of our microdose therapeutics and consist primarily of personnel-related expenses. Given where we are in our life cycle, we do not separately track research and development expenses by project. Our research and development expenses consist of: direct clinical and non-clinical expenses, which include expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, and costs associated with preclinical activities, development activities and regulatory activities; personnel-related expenses, which include salaries and other compensation of employees that is attributable to research and development activities; and facilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in research and development activities. 
 We expense research and development costs as incurred. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or other information our vendors provide to us. Our research and development expenses may increase with the continuation of these initiatives and the expansion of development of our Optejet technology functionality, drug compounds and indications. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, legal and other professional services, insurance expense, marketing expense, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and the commercialization of our approved products and current and future product candidates. Reacquisition of License Rights Reacquisition of license rights consists of the expense related to the payments that we are required to pay Bausch + Lomb in connection with the reacquisition of the Bausch Licensed Product. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consists of (a) other income (expense) related to our sales of clinical supply to our licensees; (b) changes in fair value of equity consideration (the equity payable for the Bausch + Lomb and Formosa transactions); (c) interest income earned on Treasury bills; and (d) interest expense incurred on our indebtedness. Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue and Cost of Revenue Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1,625, which consisted primarily of revenue from the sale of Mydcombi and was offset by cost of revenues of 132,522. Write-down of inventories to net realizable value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 0.1 million, compared to 12,218 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gross loss was primarily due to write-downs of commercial inventory that were still on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 1,198, which was offset by cost of revenues of 13,416. We expect to continue to generate negative gross margins on Gen 1 Mydcombi sales during the early stage of commercialization of this product and may experience negative overall gross margins until the commercialization of other products that may generate positive gross margins.

The increase in direct clinical and non-clinical expenses was primarily due to increased costs related to the reacquisition of the CHAPERONE study from Bausch + Lomb, Mydcombi stability testing and clinical regulatory expenses. The decrease in facilities expenses was due to costs incurred in 2023 related to getting the new Reno facility online that were not incurred in 2024. The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses was primarily due to the ending of the amortization period for older equity grants and terminations during the period. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to increased IT expenses related to CHAPERONE data tracking and cybersecurity. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 3.7 million, an increase of 0.8 million, or 27 , compared to 2.9 million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in other expenses is primarily due to commercial regulatory costs for Mydcombi and software licensing fees in connection with new staff additions. The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses was primarily due to the ending of the amortization period for older equity grants. The increase in travel, lodging and meals was primarily due to increased travel by the sales team to promote our FDA approved products. Total Other Expense Total other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.6 million, a decrease of 0.2 million, compared to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of approximately 0.6 million of interest expense related to the Avenue loan.

 Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue and Cost of Revenue Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 29,243, which was offset by cost of revenues of 825,910. Write-down of inventories to net realizable value for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 0.8 million, compared to 12,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.8 million was comprised of the adjustment to bring the inventory to list price and an additional write-down of short-dated inventory to net realizable value. The gross loss was primarily due to write-downs of commercial inventory that were still on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 1,198, which was offset by cost of revenues of 13,416. We expect to continue to generate negative gross margins on Gen 1 Mydcombi sales during the early stage of commercialization of this product and may experience negative overall gross margins until the commercialization of other products that may generate positive gross margins. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 12.5 million, an increase of 3.6 million, or 40 , compared to 8.9 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in supplies and materials expense was primarily due to the expensing of Gen-1 MicroPine clinical product and materials that will now be used in Eyenovia-led clinical trials rather than being sold to Bausch + Lomb as a result of the reacquisition of the Bausch Licensed Product; drug formulation engineering batches related to Gen 2.0 specific formulations and future Mydcombi production. The increase in personnel-related expenses was primarily due to new staff additions made to support commercialization during the last two quarters of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to increased equipment purchases and equipment placed in service during the last two quarters of 2023 and the first and second quarters of 2024. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to increased IT expenses related to CHAPERONE data tracking and cybersecurity. The decrease in facilities expenses was due to costs incurred in 2023 related to getting the new Reno facility online that were not incurred in 2024.

The increase in regulatory expenses was primarily due to the FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act PDUFA fees for Mydcombi. The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses was primarily due to the ending of the amortization period for older equity grants. The increase in travel, lodging and meals was primarily due to increased travel by the sales team to promote Mydcombi. The increase in professional fees was primarily due to the short-term need for temporary staff while in the process of hiring permanent employees. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to samples initiatives for the Clobetasol launch in 2024. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to software licensing and public filing fees. Reacquisition of License Rights Reacquisition of license rights for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 4.9 million, compared to no expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Liquidity and Going Concern We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following: 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Cash and Cash Equivalents 7,188,129 14,849,057 Working (Deficit) Capital (4,093,399) 11,176,336 Notes Payable (Gross) 12,368,804 15,637,500 Cash Flow Since inception, we have experienced negative cash flows from operations and our operations have primarily been funded by proceeds from equity and debt financings. Our net losses were 29.9 million and 19.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 175.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 7.2 million, a working capital deficit of 4.1 million and stockholders equity of 3.7 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 12.4 million and 15.6 million, respectively, of gross debt outstanding. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were issued. Our financial statements do not include adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities to support our future operations and the potential for entering into collaborations with other companies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings, and to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in the near term, which will be necessary to avoid a default on such obligations. Our operating needs also include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund research and development activities including clinical studies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to further improve the marketability of our product and service offerings. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce selling, general and administrative costs in order to conserve our cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our sources and uses of cash were as follows: Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 24.0 million, which includes cash used to fund a net loss of 29.9 million, reduced by 5.8 million of net non-cash expenses, plus 0.1 million of net cash generated from changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 17.5 million, which includes cash used to fund a net loss of 19.3 million, reduced by 3.7 million of non-cash expenses, plus 2.0 million of cash used to fund changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.2 million, which was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3.8 million, which was related to 2.7 million for purchases of property and equipment and a 1.1 million cash investment in an intangible asset. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 16.5 million, which was primarily attributable to 14.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in offerings and, 6.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our at-the-market offering pursuant to the Sales Agreement with Leerink Partners, partially offset by 3.8 million from the repayment of notes payable. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 19.2 million, which was attributable to 10.9 million of net proceeds received from a registered direct offering, 4.0 million of net proceeds from an at-the-market offering and 4.9 million of net proceeds from the additional tranche under the Loan and Security Agreement. This was slightly offset by the repayment of 0.6 million of notes payable in connection with the D O Loan.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments During the next twelve months, we have commitments to pay (a) 5.7 million to settle our September 30, 2024 accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, (b) 0.6 million relating to our non-cancelable operating lease commitments, and (c) 10.1 million of gross payments due under our notes payable, convertible notes payable (if not previously converted). After the next twelve months we have commitments to pay (a) an additional 0.3 million related to our accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities, (b) 0.8 million relating to our non-cancelable operating lease commitments, and (c) 2.3 million of gross payments due in connection with notes payable and convertible notes payable (if not previously converted). Risks and Uncertainties The continuing worldwide implications of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East remain difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of sanctions on Russia by the United States and other countries and counter sanctions by Russia, and the resulting economic impacts on oil prices and other materials and goods, could affect the price of materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates. If the price of materials used in the manufacturing of our product candidates increase, that would adversely affect our business and the results of our operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements between us and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Estimates As described in Item 7 Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Form 10-K, as amended by our 2023 Form 10-K Amendment, we prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Smaller reporting companies such as Eyenovia are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. 

 28 

Table of Contents 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to, and were effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K, as amended by our 2023 Form 10-K Amendment. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds . Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers None. Item 3.

COMPANY : Eyenovia, Inc. By: Name: Title: Address: GRANTEE : Address: 

EYENOVIA, INC. INDUCEMENT STOCK OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT This Inducement Stock Option Award Agreement is made by and between Eyenovia, Inc. and Grantee effective as of the Date of Grant. Certain definitions for capitalized terms used in this Agreement and the Grant Notice are set forth in Section 19 below. 1. Grant of Option. The Company has granted to Grantee an option to purchase, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, all or any part of the number of Shares described in the Grant Notice, at the Exercise Price set forth in the Grant Notice (the Option ), subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 12 below. The Option is intended to constitute an employment inducement award and to be exempt from shareholder approval requirements under Nasdaq Rule 5635(c)(4) and this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Option will be interpreted consistent with such intent. The Option is a non-qualified stock option. 2. Vesting. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Option will vest as provided in the Grant Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of Grantee s Continuous Service. 3. Forfeiture; Expiration. Any unvested portion of the Option will be forfeited immediately, automatically, and without consideration upon a termination of Grantee s Continuous Service for any reason. In the event Grantee s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the vested portion of the Option will also be forfeited immediately, automatically, and without consideration upon that termination for Cause. Any unexercised vested portion of the Option will expire on the Expiration Date set forth in the Grant Notice. 4. Period of Exercise. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Grantee may exercise all or any part of the vested portion of the Option at any time prior to the earliest to occur of: (a) the Expiration Date; (b) the effective date of the termination of Grantee s Continuous Service for Cause; (c) the date that is twelve (12) months after the termination of Grantee s Continuous Service due to his or her death or Disability, provided, however, that in the event Grantee dies within such twelve (12) month period after the termination of Grantee s Continuous Service due to his or her Disability, the period for exercise will be extended until the date twelve (12) months after his or her death (but in no event later than the Expiration Date); or (d) the date that is three (3) months after the termination of Grantee s Continuous Service for any reason other than Cause, Disability or death; provided however, that in the event that Grantee dies within such three (3) month period, the period for exercise will be extended until the date twelve (12) months after his or her death (but in no event later than the Expiration Date). 

 5. Exercise of Option. Grantee or, in the case of Grantee s death or Disability, Grantee s representative, may exercise all or any part of the vested portion of the Option by delivering to the Company at its principal office a written notice of exercise in the form attached as Exhibit A or any other form that the Administrator may permit (such notice, a Notice of Exercise ). The Notice of Exercise will be signed by the person exercising the Option. In the event that the Option is being exercised by Grantee s representative, the Notice of Exercise will be accompanied by proof (satisfactory to the Administrator) of the representative s right to exercise the Option. In addition, any exercise of the Option, whether in whole or in part, is subject to the following conditions: (a) Grantee (or Grantee s representative, if applicable) will deliver to the Company, at the time of giving the Notice of Exercise, payment in a form permissible under Section 6 below for the full amount of the Purchase Price; (b) Grantee (or Grantee s representative, if applicable) may exercise the Option only for whole Shares; (c) Grantee (or Grantee s representative, if applicable) may not exercise the Option unless the tax withholding obligations of the Company and/or any Related Entity, as described in Section 9 below, are satisfied; and (d) In the event that Grantee is an employee eligible for overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (sometimes referred to as a non-exempt employee ), then he or she may not exercise the Option until he or she has completed at least six (6) months of Continuous Service measured from the Date of Grant, notwithstanding any other provision of the Option. 6. Payment for Shares. The Purchase Price will be the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised. The Purchase Price may be paid as follows: (a) in cash; (b) by check or money order; (c) by surrender to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of already-owned shares of Common Stock that are owned by Grantee free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or security interests, with a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender or attestation equal to the Purchase Price (provided that Grantee may not exercise the Option by tender to the Company of Common Stock to the extent such tender would violate the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company s stock); (d) through a formal net exercise arrangement adopted by the Company pursuant to which Grantee may exercise the Option and receive the net number of Shares equal to (i) the number of Shares as to which the Option is being exercised, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Fair Market Value per Share (on such date as is determined by the Administrator) less the Exercise Price per Share, and the denominator of which is such Fair Market Value per Share; 
 2 

 (e) through a broker-dealer sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Grantee (i) shall provide written instructions to a Company designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of some or all of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the purchased Shares and (ii) shall provide written directives to the Company to deliver the certificates (or other evidence satisfactory to the Company to the extent that the Shares are uncertificated) for the purchased Shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction; or (f) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. 7. Compliance with Applicable Laws. (a) If at any time the Administrator determines that the delivery of Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Option is or may be unlawful under Applicable Laws, the right to exercise the Option shall be suspended until the Administrator determines that such delivery is lawful and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. No Shares will be issued pursuant to this Agreement unless and until all then applicable requirements imposed by federal and state securities and other laws, rules and regulations and by any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, and by any exchanges upon which the Shares may be listed, have been fully met. The Company may impose such conditions on any Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under the requirements of any exchange upon which shares of the same class are then listed, and under any blue sky or other securities laws applicable to those Shares. The Company shall have no obligation to effect any registration or qualification of the Shares under any Applicable Law. (b) As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the person exercising the Option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any Applicable Laws. (c) Subject to the Applicable Laws and any governing rules or regulations, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued the Shares acquired pursuant to the Option and shall deliver such Shares to or for the benefit of Grantee by means of one or more of the following as determined by the Administrator: (i) by delivering to Grantee evidence of book entry Shares credited to the account of Grantee, (ii) by depositing such Shares for the benefit of Grantee with any broker with which Grantee has an account relationship, or (iii) by delivering such Shares to Grantee in certificate form. 8. Withholding Obligations. Grantee may incur Tax Obligations under federal, state, local, and/or foreign law, in connection with the grant, vesting, or exercise of the Option, the ownership of the Shares, and other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement, and the Company may be required to satisfy by withholding from Grantee s compensation or otherwise collect from Grantee. Grantee agrees that the Company (or a Related Entity) may condition the exercise of the Option upon the satisfaction of such withholding tax obligations, and may satisfy such withholding obligations by any of the following means or by a combination of such means, in the 
 3 

 Administrator s discretion: (i) withholding from any compensation otherwise payable to Grantee by the Company; (ii) causing Grantee to tender a cash payment; or (iii) withholding from the Shares otherwise issuable to Grantee upon exercise of the Option the number of Shares with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the date the tax withholding obligations are to be determined) equal to the amount of such tax withholding; provided, however, that the number of such Shares so withheld will not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Company s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to avoid classification of the Shares as a liability for financial accounting purposes). Grantee understands that all matters with respect to the total amount of taxes to be withheld in respect of such compensation income will be determined by the Administrator in its reasonable discretion. Grantee further understands that, although the Company will pay withheld amounts to the applicable taxing authorities, Grantee remains responsible for payment of all taxes due as a result of income arising under the Agreement. 9. Rights as a Stockholder. Neither Grantee nor anyone claiming through Grantee will have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares subject to the Option until Grantee has exercised the Option as described herein and the Shares are delivered (as evidenced by delivery of a certificate for such Shares or the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). 10. Transferability. The Option may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and in accordance with the Applicable Laws, and is exercisable during Grantee s life only by Grantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Administrator, Grantee may designate a third party who, in the event of Grantee s death, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option. 11. Option Not an Employment Contract. Neither the Option nor this Agreement is an employment or service contract, and nothing in this Agreement or the Grant Notice creates or will be deemed to create in any way whatsoever any right or obligation on Grantee s part to continue in the employment or service of the Company or a Related Entity, or of the Company or a Related Entity to continue Grantee s employment or service, or interferes with or limits in any way the right of the Company or a Related Entity to terminate Grantee s employment or service at any time or for any reason in accordance with the Applicable Laws. 12. Adjustments . Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by the Option and the Exercise Price, as well as any other terms that the Administrator determines require adjustment, shall be proportionately adjusted for (i) any increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Shares, or similar transaction affecting the Shares, (ii) any other increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, or (iii) any other transaction with respect to the Company s Common Stock including a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation (including a spin-off or other distribution of stock or property), reorganization, liquidation (whether partial or complete) or any similar transaction; provided, however that conversion of any convertible securities of the 
 4 

 Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration. Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as the Administrator determines, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason hereof shall be made with respect to, the number of Shares subject to the Option or the Exercise Price. No adjustments shall be made for dividends paid in cash or in property other than Common Stock of the Company, nor shall cash dividends or dividend equivalents accrue or be paid in respect of the Option. 13. Administration of Option. This Agreement and the Option shall be administered by the Board. To the extent permitted by the Applicable Laws, the Board may delegate by resolution any or all of its powers under this Agreement to one or more Committees. All references in this Agreement to the Administrator shall mean the Board or a Committee referred to in this paragraph, to the extent that the Board s powers or authority under this Agreement have been delegated to such Committee. The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer this Agreement and the Option with any Committee and may, at any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated. The Administrator shall have full discretionary authority to construe and interpret the terms of this Agreement and to determine all facts necessary to administer this Agreement and the Option. All decisions by the Administrator shall be made in the Administrator s sole discretion and shall be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in this Agreement or the Option. 14. No Effect on Retirement and Other Benefit Plans . Except as specifically provided in a retirement or other benefit plan of the Company or a Related Entity, the Option shall not be deemed compensation for purposes of computing benefits or contributions under any retirement plan of the Company or a Related Entity, and shall not affect any benefits under any other benefit plan of the Company or a Related Entity, in each case, whether such plan is now or hereafter existing. 15. Electronic Delivery . The Administrator may decide to deliver any documents related to the Option through an online or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company or to request Grantee s acceptance of the Option by electronic means. By accepting the Option, Grantee consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Option through an online or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company, and such consent shall remain in effect throughout Grantee s Continuous Service with the Company and any Related Entity and thereafter until withdrawn in writing by Grantee. 16. Data Privacy . The Administrator may decide to collect, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, personal data as described in this Agreement for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Option. By accepting the Option, Grantee acknowledges that the Company holds certain personal information about Grantee, including, but not limited to, name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social security number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, details of all equity awards awarded, cancelled, exercised, vested or unvested, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Option (the Data ). Grantee further acknowledges that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Option 
 5 

 and that these third parties may be located in jurisdictions that may have different data privacy laws and protections, and Grantee authorizes such third parties to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Option, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom the recipient or the Company may elect to deposit any Shares acquired pursuant to the Option. 17. Application of Section 409A . The Option and this Agreement shall be interpreted to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Grantee will be solely responsible for the tax consequences of the Option, and in no event will the Company have any responsibility or liability if the Option does not meet any applicable requirements of Section 409A. Although the Company intends to administer the Option and this Agreement to prevent taxation under Section 409A, the Company does not represent or warrant that the Option or this Agreement complies with any provision of federal, state, local or other tax law. If, upon Grantee s separation from service, Grantee is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, any payment that is subject to Section 409A and triggered by a separation from service and would otherwise be paid within six months after Grantee s separation from service will instead be paid in the seventh month following Grantee s separation from service (to the extent required by Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)). 18. Grantee Acknowledgement . Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the Option is granted in full satisfaction of Grantee s right, if any, to an equity award under any offer letter, employment agreement or similar letter, agreement, or communication from the Company or any Related Entity. 19.

(d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Company. (e) Cause means, with respect to the termination by the Company or a Related Entity of Grantee s Continuous Service: (i) that such termination is for Cause as such term (or word of like import) is expressly defined in a then-effective written employment agreement, consulting agreement, service agreement or other similar agreement between Grantee and the Company or such Related Entity, provided, however, that with regard to any agreement that defines Cause 
 6 

 on the occurrence of or in connection with a Corporate Transaction, such definition of Cause shall not apply until a Corporate Transaction actually occurs; or (ii) in the absence of such then-effective written agreement and definition, is based on, in the determination of the Administrator: (A) Grantee s performance of any act, or failure to perform any act, in bad faith and to the detriment of the Company or a Related Entity; (B) Grantee s dishonesty, intentional misconduct or material breach of any agreement with the Company or a Related Entity; (C) Grantee s material breach of any noncompetition, confidentiality or similar agreement with the Company or a Related Entity, as determined under such agreement; (D) Grantee s commission of a crime involving dishonesty, breach of trust, or physical or emotional harm to any person; (E) Grantee s engaging in acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, misconduct or a willful violation of a Company or a Related Entity policy which is or is reasonably expected to be materially injurious to the Company and/or a Related Entity; or (F) Grantee s failure to follow the reasonable instructions of the Board or Grantee s direct supervisor, which failure, if curable, is not cured within 10 days after notice to Grantee or, if cured, recurs within 180 days.

Exhibit 10.8 INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT AGREEMENT This Indemnification and Advancement Agreement Agreement is made as of , 2024 by and between Eyenovia, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and [name], [a member of the Board of Directors/an officer/an employee/an agent] of the Company Indemnitee ). This Agreement supersedes and replaces any and all previous Agreements between the Company and Indemnitee covering indemnification and advancement of expenses. RECITALS WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board believes that highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors, officers, or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification and advancement of expenses against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation; WHEREAS, the Board has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself. The Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the Charter and the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws of the Company require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company, and the Bylaws permit indemnification of employees and agents of the Company to the extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ). The Charter, the Bylaws and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of its board of directors, officers, and other persons with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses; WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance, to indemnification, and to advancement of expenses may increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons; WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future; WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to, and in furtherance of, the Charter, the Bylaws, and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, as well as any rights of Indemnitee under any directors and officers liability insurance policy, and is not a substitute therefor, and does not diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder; and WHEREAS, Indemnitee may not be willing to serve or continue to serve as an officer, director or employee without adequate additional protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve or continue to serve in such capacity. Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified and be advanced expenses, if that becomes necessary. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows: Section 1. Services to the Company. Indemnitee agrees to serve or continue to serve as a [director/officer/employee/agent] of the Company. Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law).

Change in Board of Directors . During any period of three (3) consecutive years (not including any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Sections 2(b)(i), 2(b)(iii) or 2(b)(iv) of this Agreement) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board; iii. Corporate Transactions .

Section 10. Advances of Expenses. (a) The Company will advance, to the extent not prohibited by law (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final adjudication not subject to further appeal), the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) not initiated by Indemnitee or any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee if (i) the Proceeding or part of any Proceeding is to enforce Indemnitee s rights to obtain indemnification or advancement of Expenses from the Company or an Enterprise, including a proceeding initiated pursuant to Section 14 or (ii) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation. The Company will advance the Expenses within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding eligible for advancement of expenses. (b) Advances will be unsecured and interest free. Indemnitee undertakes to repay the amounts advanced (without interest) to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company, thus Indemnitee qualifies for advances upon the execution of this Agreement and delivery to the Company. No other form of undertaking is required other than the execution of this Agreement. The Company will make advances without regard to Indemnitee s ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to Indemnitee s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section 15(a) of this Agreement, no advance shall be made by the Company to Indemnitee (except by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any Proceeding if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (ii) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, or (iii) if there are no such Disinterested 

Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by written opinion provided by Independent Counsel selected by the Board, that facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that Indemnitee acted in bad faith or in a manner that Indemnitee did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Section 11. Procedure for Notification of Claim for Indemnification or Advancement. (a) Indemnitee will notify the Company in writing of any Proceeding with respect to which Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by Indemnitee of written notice thereof. Indemnitee will include in the written notification to the Company a description of the nature of the Proceeding. Indemnitee s failure to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any obligation it may have to Indemnitee under this Agreement, and any delay in so notifying the Company will not constitute a waiver by Indemnitee of any rights under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company will, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification or advancement, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification or advancement. Indemnitee agrees to choose counsel that is a member of the approved list of panel counsel under the Company s applicable directors and officers insurance policy, should the applicable policy provide for a panel of approved counsel. (b) The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense. Section 12. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.

(b) If a Change in Control has occurred, the determination of Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification will be made by written opinion provided by Independent Counsel selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee requests such selection be made by the Board). (c) The party selecting Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 10(c) of this Agreement or subsection (a)(iii) or (b) of this Section 12 will provide written notice of the selection to the other party. The notified party may, within ten (10) days after receiving written notice of the selection of Independent Counsel, deliver to the selecting party a written objection to such selection; provided , however , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of Independent Counsel as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection will set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected will act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within thirty (30) days after the later of submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement and the final disposition of the Proceeding, Independent Counsel has not been selected or, if selected, any objection to such selection has not been resolved, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Delaware Court for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by such court or by such other person as such court designates. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 14(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel will be 

discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing). (d) Indemnitee will cooperate with the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. The Company will advance and pay any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making the indemnification determination irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. The Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing of the determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description of any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied and providing a copy of any written opinion provided to the Board by Independent Counsel. (e) If it is determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company will make payment to Indemnitee within thirty (30) days after such determination. Section 13. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings. (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement, the person, persons, or entity making such determination will, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, presume Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 11(a) of this Agreement, and the Company will, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper under the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, will be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. (b) If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Agreement is not paid by the Company or on its behalf within ninety (90) days after receipt by the Company of Indemnitee s written request therefor pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement, Indemnitee will be entitled to an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of Indemnitee s entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of any claim or Proceeding. (c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee s conduct was unlawful. (d) For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee will be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee acted based on the records or books of account of the Company, its subsidiaries, or an Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Company, its subsidiaries, or an Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company, its subsidiaries, or an Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Company or an Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser, financial advisor or other expert selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Company, its subsidiaries, or an Enterprise. Further, Indemnitee will be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Company, as referred to in this Agreement, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan. The provisions of this Section 13(d) are 

not exclusive and do not limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. (e) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other person affiliated with the Company or an Enterprise (including, but not limited to, a director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, Agent or employee) may not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining Indemnitee s right to indemnification under this Agreement. Section 14. Remedies of Indemnitee. (a) Subject to the last sentence of Section 13(b) of this Agreement, Indemnitee may commence litigation against the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain indemnification or advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) the Company does not advance Expenses pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement, (iii) the Company does not indemnify Indemnitee pursuant to Section 5 or 6 or the second to last sentence of Section 12(d) of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, (iv) the Company does not indemnify Indemnitee pursuant to Section 3, 4, 7, or 8 of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at Indemnitee s option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee must commence such Proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such Proceeding pursuant to this Section 14(a); provided , however , that the foregoing clause does not apply in respect of a Proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce Indemnitee s rights under Section 5 of this Agreement. The Company will not oppose Indemnitee s right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration. (b) If a determination is made pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 will be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee may not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 the Company will have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be, and will not introduce evidence of the determination made pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement. (c) If a determination is made pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company will be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 unless (i) a misstatement is made of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with Indemnitee s request for indemnification, or (ii) the Company is prohibited from indemnifying Indemnitee under applicable law. (d) The Company is precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding, or enforceable and will stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. (e) It is the intent of the Company that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Indemnitee under this Agreement. The Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will (within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor) advance to Indemnitee such Expenses which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding concerning this Agreement, Indemnitee s other rights to indemnification or advancement of Expenses from the Company, or concerning any directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, and will indemnify Indemnitee against any and all such Expenses unless the court determines that each of the Indemnitee s claims in such Proceeding were made in bad faith or frivolous, or that Indemnitee is not entitled to 

be indemnified by the Company under the provisions of this Agreement, the Charter, the Bylaws, applicable law or otherwise. Section 15. Non-exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation. (a) The indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement are not exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Charter, the Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise. The indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement may not be limited or restricted by any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement in any way with respect to any action taken or omitted by Indemnitee in Indemnitee s Corporate Status occurring prior to any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement. To the extent that a change in Delaware law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Charter, Bylaws or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy is cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, will not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy. (b) The Company hereby acknowledges that Indemnitee may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of Expenses and/or insurance provided by one or more Persons with whom or which Indemnitee may be associated. i. The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees: 1) the Company is the indemnitor of first resort with respect to any request for indemnification or advancement of Expenses made pursuant to this Agreement concerning any Proceeding arising from or related to Indemnitee s Corporate Status with the Company; 2) the Company is primarily liable for all indemnification or advancement of Expenses obligations for any Proceeding arising from or related to Indemnitee s Corporate Status, whether created by law, organizational or constituent documents, contract (including this Agreement) or otherwise; 3) any obligation of any other Persons with whom or which Indemnitee may be associated to indemnify Indemnitee and/or advance Expenses to Indemnitee in respect of any proceeding are secondary to the Company s obligations; 4) the Company will indemnify Indemnitee and advance Expenses to Indemnitee hereunder to the fullest extent provided herein without regard to any rights Indemnitee may have against any other Person with whom or which Indemnitee may be associated or an insurer of any such Person; and ii. the Company irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases (A) any other Person with whom or which Indemnitee may be associated from any claim of contribution, subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration or indemnification, or any other recovery of any kind in respect of amounts paid by the Company to Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law. iii. In the event any other Person with whom or which Indemnitee may be associated or their insurers advances or extinguishes any liability or loss for Indemnitee, the payor has a right of subrogation against the Company or its insurers for all amounts so paid which would otherwise be payable by the Company or its insurers under this Agreement. In no event will payment by any other Person with whom or which Indemnitee may be associated or their insurers affect the obligations of the Company hereunder or shift primary liability for the Company s obligation to indemnify or advance of Expenses to any other Person with whom or which Indemnitee may be associated. 

iv. Any indemnification or advancement of Expenses provided by any other Person with whom or which Indemnitee may be associated is specifically in excess over the Company s obligation to indemnify and advance Expenses or any valid and collectible insurance (including but not limited to any malpractice insurance or professional errors and omissions insurance) provided by the Company. (c) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or Agents of the Company or an Enterprise, the Indemnitee will be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, employee or Agent under such policy or policies, including coverage in the event the Company does not or cannot, for any reason, indemnify or advance Expenses to Indemnitee as required by this Agreement. If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to this Agreement, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company will give prompt notice of such claim or of the commencement of a Proceeding, as the case may be, to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company will thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. Indemnitee agrees to assist the Company s efforts to cause the insurers to pay such amounts and will comply with the terms of such policies, including selection of approved panel counsel, if required. In the event of a Change in Control or the Company s becoming insolvent, the Company shall maintain in force any and all insurance policies then maintained by the Company in providing insurance directors and officers liability, fiduciary, employment practices or otherwise in respect of the individual directors and officers of the Company, for a fixed period of six years thereafter (a Tail Policy ). Such coverage shall be non-cancellable and shall be placed and serviced for the duration of its term by the Company s incumbent insurance broker. Such broker shall place the Tail Policy with the incumbent insurance carriers using the policies that were in place at the time of the Change in Control (unless the incumbent carriers will not offer such policies, in which case the Tail Policy placed by the Company s insurance broker shall be substantially comparable in scope and amount as the expiring policies, and the insurance carriers for the Tail Policy shall have an AM Best rating that is the same or better than the AM Best ratings of the expiring policies). (d) The Company s obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee for any Proceeding concerning Indemnitee s Corporate Status with an Enterprise will be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of Expenses from such Enterprise. The Company and Indemnitee intend that any such Enterprise (and its insurers) be the indemnitor of first resort with respect to indemnification and advancement of Expenses for any Proceeding related to or arising from Indemnitee s Corporate Status with such Enterprise. The Company s obligation to indemnify and advance Expenses to Indemnitee is secondary to the obligations the Enterprise or its insurers owe to Indemnitee. Indemnitee agrees to take all reasonably necessary and desirable action to obtain from an Enterprise indemnification and advancement of Expenses for any Proceeding related to or arising from Indemnitee s Corporate Status with such Enterprise. (e) In the event of any payment made by the Company under this Agreement, the Company will be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee from any Enterprise or insurance carrier. Indemnitee will execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. Section 16. Duration of Agreement. All the rights and privileges afforded by this Agreement, including the right to indemnification and the advancement of legal fees provided under this Agreement, shall continue as to Indemnitee for any action taken or not taken while serving in an indemnified capacity pertaining to an indemnifiable event even though Indemnitee may have ceased to serve in such capacity at the time of any Proceeding. The indemnification and advancement of Expenses rights provided by or granted pursuant to this Agreement will(i) be binding upon and enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), (ii) continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or Agent of the Company or of any other Enterprise, and (iii) inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitee s spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and other legal representatives. Section 17. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of 

this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and will remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions will be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) will be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby. Section 18. Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the terms of this Agreement will be resolved in favor of Indemnitee and in a manner to provide the maximum indemnification and advancement of Expenses permitted by law. The Company and Indemnitee intend that this Agreement provide to the fullest extent permitted by law for indemnification and advancement of Expenses in excess of that expressly provided, without limitation, by the Charter, the Bylaws, vote of the Company s stockholders or Disinterested Directors, or applicable law. Section 19. Enforcement. (a) The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve as a director, officer, employee, or Agent of the Company, and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving or continuing to serve as a director, officer, employee, or Agent of the Company. (b) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Charter, the Bylaws, any directors and officers insurance maintained by the Company, and applicable law, is not a substitute therefor, and does not diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder. Section 20. Modification and Waiver. No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement is binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Section 21. Notice by Indemnitee. Indemnitee agrees to promptly notify the Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding or matter which may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company does not relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to the Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise. Section 22. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given if (a) delivered by hand to the other party, (b) sent by reputable overnight courier to the other party or (c) sent by electronic mail, with receipt of oral confirmation that such communication has been received: (a) If to Indemnitee, at the address indicated on the signature page of this Agreement, or such other address as Indemnitee provides to the Company. (b) If to the Company to: Name: Eyenovia, Inc. Address: 295 Madison Avenue, Suite 2400 New York, NY 10017 Attention: Corporate Secretary Email: ajones@eyenovia.com 

or to any other address as may have been furnished to Indemnitee by the Company. Section 23. Contribution. To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, will contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and Agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s). Section 24. Applicable Law and Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and the legal relations among the parties are governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Except with respect to any arbitration commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 14(a) of this Agreement, the Company and Indemnitee hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agree that any action or Proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement may be brought only in the Delaware Court and not in any other state or federal court in the United States of America or any court in any other country, (ii) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court for purposes of any action or Proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, (iii) waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such action or Proceeding in the Delaware Court, and (iv) waive, and agree not to plead or to make, any claim that any such action or Proceeding brought in the Delaware Court has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum. Section 25. Identical Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together constitute one and the same Agreement. Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought needs to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement. Section 26. Headings. The headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute part of this Agreement or affect the construction thereof. [Signature Page Follows]
