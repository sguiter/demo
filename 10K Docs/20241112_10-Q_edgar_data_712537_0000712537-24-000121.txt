million excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and is not amortizable or deductible for tax purposes. The amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company with Centric. 
 The fair value of the common shares issued was determined based on the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the acquisition date, January 31, 2023. 
 The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities was completed in the second quarter of 2023. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company used an independent valuation specialist to assist with the determination of fair values for certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities. 
 Cash and due from banks - The estimated fair value was determined to approximate the carrying amount of these assets. 
 Investment securities - The estimated fair value of the investment portfolio was based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes, and pricing obtained from independent pricing services. 
 Loans - The estimated fair value of loans was based on a discounted cash flow methodology applied on a pooled basis for non- purchased credit-deteriorated ("non-PCD") loans and on an individual basis for purchased credit-deteriorated ("PCD") loans. The valuation considered underlying characteristics including loan type, term, rate, payment schedule and credit rating. Other factors included assumptions related to prepayments, the probability of default and loss given default. The discount rates applied were based on a build-up approach considering the funding mix, servicing costs, liquidity premium and factors related to performance risk. 
 Acquired loans are classified into two categories: PCD loans and non-PCD loans. PCD loans are defined as a loan or group of loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCD loans will have an allowance established on acquisition date, which is recognized as an expense through provision for credit losses. For PCD loans, an allowance is recognized on day 1 by adding it to the fair value of the loan, which is the Day 1 amortized cost . There is no provision for credit loss expense recognized on PCD loans because the initial allowance is established by grossing-up the amortized cost of the PCD loan. 
 A day 1 allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans of million was recorded through the provision for credit losses within the Consolidated Statements of Income. At the date of acquisition, of the million of loans acquired from Centric, million, or , of Centric's loan portfolio, was accounted for as PCD loans as of February 1, 2023. 
 Premise and equipment - The estimated fair value of land and buildings were determined by independent market-based appraisals. 
 Core deposit intangible - The core deposit intangible was valued utilizing the cost savings method approach, which recognizes the cost savings represented by the expense of maintaining the core deposit base versus the cost of an alternative funding source. The valuation incorporates assumptions related to account retention, discount rates, deposit interest rates, deposit maintenance costs and alternative funding rates. 
 Time deposits - The estimated fair value of time deposits was determined using a discounted cash flow approach incorporating a discount rate equal to current market interest rates offered on time deposits with similar terms and maturities. 
 Borrowings - The estimated fair value of short-term borrowings was determined to approximate stated value. Subordinated debentures were valued using a discounted cash flow approach incorporating a discount rate that incorporated similar terms, maturities and credit ratings.

 Costs related to the acquisition totaled million. These amounts were expensed as incurred and are recorded as a merger and acquisition related expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 As a result of the full integration of the operations of Centric, it is not practicable to determine revenue or net income included in the Company's operating results relating to Centric since the date of acquisition as Centric results cannot be separately identified.

million in performance standby letters of credit and million in financial standby letters of credit. There were commercial letters of credit issued in 2024. A liability of million and million has been recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which represents the estimated fair value of letters of credit issued. The fair value of letters of credit is estimated based on the unrecognized portion of fees received at the time the commitment was issued. 
 Unused commitments and letters of credit provide exposure to future credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower or guaranteed parties. Management s evaluation of the credit risk related to these commitments resulted in the recording of a liability of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This liability is reflected in "Other liabilities" in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The credit risk evaluation incorporates the expected loss percentage calculated for comparable loan categories as part of the allowance for credit losses for loans as well as estimated utilization for each loan category. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 First Commonwealth and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. As of September 30, 2024, management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation pending or threatened against First Commonwealth or its subsidiaries will be material to First Commonwealth s consolidated financial position. On at least a quarterly basis, First Commonwealth assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with such legal proceedings. For those matters where it is probable that First Commonwealth will incur losses and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated, First Commonwealth records an expense and corresponding liability in its consolidated financial statements. To the extent the pending or threatened litigation could result in exposure in excess of that liability, the amount of such excess is not currently estimable. Although not considered probable, the range of reasonably possible losses for such matters in the aggregate, beyond the existing recorded liability (if any), is between and million. Although First Commonwealth does not believe that the outcome of pending litigation will be material to First Commonwealth s consolidated financial position, it cannot rule out the possibility that such outcomes will be material to the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for a particular reporting period in the future.

 Mortgage-backed securities include mortgage-backed obligations of U.S. Government agencies and obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. These obligations have contractual maturities ranging from less than one year to approximately 42 years, with lower anticipated lives to maturity due to prepayments. All mortgage-backed securities contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Interest rate changes have a direct impact upon prepayment speeds; therefore, First Commonwealth uses computer simulation models to test the average life and yield volatility of all mortgage-backed securities under various interest rate scenarios to monitor the potential impact on earnings and interest rate risk positions. 
 Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or repay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Other fixed income securities within the portfolio also contain prepayment risk.

 Securities held to maturity with an amortized cost of million and million were pledged as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 
 Other Investments 
 As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB"), First Commonwealth is required to purchase and hold stock in the FHLB to satisfy membership and borrowing requirements. The level of stock required to be held is dependent on the amount of First Commonwealth's mortgage-related assets and outstanding borrowings with the FHLB. This stock is restricted in that it can only be sold to the FHLB or to another member institution, and all sales of FHLB stock must be at par. As a result of these restrictions, FHLB stock is unlike other investment securities insofar as there is no trading market for FHLB stock and the transfer price is determined by FHLB membership rules and not by market participants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our FHLB stock totaled million and million, respectively, and is included in Other investments on the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 FHLB stock is held as a long-term investment and its value is determined based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. First Commonwealth evaluates impairment quarterly and has concluded that the par value of its investment in FHLB stock will be recovered. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded on these securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, "Other investments" also includes million and million, respectively, in equity securities. These securities do not have a readily determinable fair value and are carried at cost. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were gains or losses recognized through earnings on these equity securities. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates equity securities by reviewing the severity and duration of decline in estimated fair value, research reports, analysts recommendations, credit rating changes, news stories, annual reports, regulatory filings, impact of interest rate changes and other relevant information.

Impairment of Investment Securities 
 We review our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment. For available for sale securities, the review includes analyzing the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and whether we are more likely than not to sell the security. We evaluate whether we are more likely than not to sell debt securities based upon our investment strategy for the particular type of security and our cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy, tax position and interest rate risk position. Held-to-maturity securities are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis using historical probability of default and loss given default information specific to the investment category. If this evaluation determines that credit losses exist an allowance for credit loss is recorded and included in earnings as a component of credit loss expense. 
 First Commonwealth utilizes the specific identification method to determine the net gain or loss on debt securities and the average cost method to determine the net gain or loss on equity securities.

Corporate securities are comprised of debt issued by large regional banks. There were corporate securities, respectively, in an unrealized loss position at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. When unrealized losses exist, management reviews each of the issuer s asset quality, earnings trends and capital position to determine whether the unrealized loss position is a result of credit losses. All interest payments on the corporate securities are being made as contractually required. 
 There was expected credit related impairment recognized on investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 First Commonwealth s loan portfolio includes five primary loan categories. When calculating the allowance for credit losses these categories are classified into fourteen portfolio segments. The composition of loans by portfolio segment includes: 
 Commercial, financial, agricultural and other 
 Time Demand - Consists primarily of commercial and industrial loans. This category consists of loans that are typically cash flow dependent and therefore have different risk and loss characteristics than other commercial loans. Loans in this category include revolving and term structures with fixed and variable interest rates. The primary macroeconomic drivers for estimating credit losses for this category include forecasts of national unemployment and economic conditions measured by GDP. 
 Commercial Credit Cards - Consists of unsecured credit cards for commercial customers. These commercial credit cards have separate characteristics outside of normal commercial non-real estate loans, as they tend to have shorter overall duration. The primary macroeconomic drivers for estimating credit losses for this category include forecasts of national unemployment and economic conditions measured by GDP. 
 Equipment Finance - Consists of loans and leases to finance the purchase of equipment for commercial customers. The risk and loss characteristics are unique for this group due to the type of collateral. The primary macroeconomic drivers for estimating credit losses for this category include forecasts of national unemployment and economic conditions measured by GDP. 
 Time Demand Other - Consists primarily of loans to state and political subdivisions and other commercial loans that have different characteristics than loans in the Time and Demand category. The primary macroeconomic drivers for estimating credit losses for this category include forecasts of household debt to income and economic conditions measured by GDP.

 Portfolio Risks 
 The credit quality of our loan portfolio can potentially represent significant risk to our earnings, capital and liquidity. First Commonwealth devotes substantial resources to managing this risk primarily through our credit administration department that develops and administers policies and procedures for underwriting, maintaining, monitoring and collecting loans. Credit administration is independent of lending departments and oversight is provided by the Risk Committee of the First Commonwealth Board of Directors.

 Nonaccrual Loans 
 The previous tables summarize nonaccrual loans by loan segment. The Company generally places loans on nonaccrual status when the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, when part of the principal balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred, or the loans reach a certain number of days past due. Generally, loans days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status, except for most consumer loans, which are placed on nonaccrual status at days past due. Consumer loans related to automobile and recreational vehicles are either charged off or repossessed at no later than 90 days past due. 
 When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, the accrued unpaid interest receivable is reversed against interest income and all future payments received are applied as a reduction to the loan principal. Generally, the loan is returned to accrual status when (a) all delinquent interest and principal becomes current under the terms of the loan agreement or (b) the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer in doubt. 
 Nonperforming Loans 
 Management considers loans to be nonperforming when, based on current information and events, it is determined that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. When management identifies a loan as nonperforming, the credit loss is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except when the sole source for repayment of the loan is the operation or liquidation of collateral. When the loan is collateral dependent, the appraised value less estimated cost to sell is utilized. If management determines that the value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, a credit loss is recognized through an allowance estimate or a charge-off to the allowance for credit losses.

 The ROU assets and lease liabilities are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. First Commonwealth's lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Company's discretion. If we consider the renewal option to be reasonably certain, we include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. 
 First Commonwealth uses incremental borrowing rates when calculating the lease liability because the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate used by First Commonwealth is an amortizing loan rate obtained from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Pittsburgh. This rate is consistent with a collateralized borrowing rate and is available for terms similar to the lease payment schedules.

 thousand are individually reviewed to determine the amount of each loan considered to be at risk of non-collection. The fair value for nonperforming loans that are collateral-based is determined by reviewing real property appraisals, equipment valuations, accounts receivable listings and other financial information. A discounted cash flow analysis is performed to determine fair value for nonperforming loans when an observable market price or a current appraisal is not available. For real estate secured loans, First Commonwealth s loan policy requires updated appraisals be obtained at least every twelve months on all nonperforming loans with balances of thousand and over. For real estate secured loans with balances under thousand, we rely on broker price opinions. For non-real estate secured assets, the Company normally relies on third party valuations specific to the collateral type. 
 The fair value for other real estate owned that is determined by either an independent market-based appraisal less estimated costs to sell or an executed sales agreement, is classified as Level 2. The fair value for other real estate owned that is determined using an internal valuation, is classified as Level 3. Other real estate owned has a current carrying value of million as of September 30, 2024 and primarily consists of residential real estate properties in Pennsylvania and Ohio. We review whether events and circumstances subsequent to a transfer to other real estate owned have occurred that indicate the balance of those assets may not be recoverable. If events and circumstances indicate further impairment, we will record a charge to the extent that the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair values, less estimated cost to sell, as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances. 
 Certain other assets and liabilities, including goodwill, core deposit intangibles and customer list intangibles are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. Additional information related to goodwill is provided in Note 13, Goodwill. There were no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Deposit liabilities : The estimated fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date because of the customers ability to withdraw funds immediately. The fair value of fixed rate time deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using interest rates currently being offered and a schedule of aggregated expected maturities. 
 Short-term borrowings : The fair values of borrowings from the FHLB were estimated based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate for similar type borrowings. The carrying amounts of other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase, were used to approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the borrowings. 
 Subordinated debt and long-term debt : The fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using First Commonwealth s estimate of the current market rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Note 12 Derivatives 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 First Commonwealth is a party to interest rate derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivatives relate to interest rate swaps that First Commonwealth enters into with customers to allow customers to convert variable rate loans to a fixed rate. First Commonwealth pays interest to the customer at a floating rate on the notional amount and receives interest from the customer at a fixed rate for the same notional amount. At the same time the interest rate swap is entered into with the customer, an offsetting interest rate swap is entered into with another financial institution. First Commonwealth pays the other financial institution interest at the same fixed rate on the same notional amount as the swap entered into with the customer, and receives interest from the financial institution for the same floating rate on the same notional amount. 
 The changes in the fair value of the swaps offset each other, except for the credit risk of the counterparties, which is determined by taking into consideration the risk rating, probability of default and loss given default for all counterparties. 
 We have risk participation agreements with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to loans in which we are a participant. The risk participation agreements provide credit protection to the financial institution should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with the financial institution. We have risk participation agreements with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to loans in which we are the lead bank. The risk participation agreement provides credit protection to us should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with us. 
 First Commonwealth is also party to interest rate caps and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The interest rate caps relate to contracts that First Commonwealth enters into with loan customers that provide a maximum interest rate on their variable rate loan. At the same time the interest rate cap is entered into with the customer, First Commonwealth enters into an offsetting interest rate cap with another financial institution. The notional amount and maximum interest rate on both interest cap contracts are identical. The interest rate collars relate to contracts that First Commonwealth enters into with loan customers that provides both a maximum and minimum interest rate on their variable rate loan. At the same time the interest rate collar is entered into with the customer, First Commonwealth enters into an offsetting interest rate collar with another financial institution. The notional amount and the maximum and minimum interest rates on both interest collar contracts are identical. 
 The fee received for such derivatives, less the estimate of the loss for the credit exposure, is recognized in earnings at the time of the transaction. 
 The Company also enters into interest rate lock commitments in conjunction with its mortgage origination business. These are commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. The Company locks in the rate with an investor and commits to deliver the loan if settlement occurs best efforts or commits to deliver the locked loan in a binding mandatory delivery program with an investor. Loans under mandatory rate lock commitments are covered under forward sales contracts of mortgage-backed securities MBS ). Forward sales contracts of MBS are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in "Noninterest income" in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income. The impact to noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an increase of million and million, respectively. 
 Interest rate lock commitments and commitments to deliver loans to investors are considered derivatives. The market value of interest rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not readily ascertainable with precision because they are not actively traded in stand-alone markets. We determine the fair value of rate lock commitments and delivery contracts by measuring the fair value of the underlying asset, which is impacted by current interest rates and takes into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close or will be funded. At September 30, 2024, the underlying funded mortgage loan commitments had a carrying value of million and a fair value of million, while the underlying unfunded mortgage loan commitments had a notional amount of million. At December 31, 2023, the underlying funded mortgage loan commitments had a carrying value of million and a fair value of million, while the underlying unfunded mortgage loan commitments had a notional amount of million. The interest rate lock commitments decreased other noninterest income by million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased other noninterest income by million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 In August 2019, the Company entered into two interest rate swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. These contracts mature on August 15, 2024 and August 15, 2026 and have notional amounts of million and million, respectively. The Company's risk management objective for these hedges is to reduce its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to interest payments made on subordinated debentures. Initially these swaps were benchmarked to the 3-month LIBOR rate; however, as a result of the discontinuance of the LIBOR rate on June 30, 2023, both of the swap contracts were amended to hedge exposure to the variability of the 3-month Daily Simple SOFR, compounded in arrears. This change is in agreement with amendments made to the interest rate on the subordinated debentures as a result of the discontinuance of LIBOR. Therefore, the interest rate swaps convert the interest rate benchmark on the first million of 3-month SOFR based subordinated debentures to a fixed rate. 
 During 2021, the Company entered into eight interest rate swap contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges, 25.0 million of which matured during the second quarter of 2024. The remaining interest rate swaps have a total notional amount of million: million with an original maturity of three years, million with an original maturity of four years and million with an original maturity of five years. The Company's risk management objective for these hedges is to reduce its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to interest payments on commercial loans. Initially these swaps were benchmarked to the 1-month LIBOR rate however, as a result of the discontinuance of the LIBOR rate on June 30, 2023, these swaps were amended to hedge exposure to the variability of the 1-month Daily Simple SOFR rate compounded in arrears. Therefore, the interest rate swaps convert the interest payments on the first of 1-month Daily Simple SOFR based commercial loans into fixed rate payments. The following table provides the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts and their maturity date. 
 Notional Amount Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) 12/01/24 05/01/25 08/25/25 10/10/25 11/05/25 05/01/26 10/15/26 
 The periodic net settlement of these interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment to "Interest on subordinated debentures" or "Interest and fees on loans" in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a negative impact of million and million, respectively, on net interest income as a result of these interest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are reported on the balance sheet and in OCI. When the cash flows associated with the hedged item are realized, the gain or loss included in OCI is recognized in "Interest on subordinated debentures," or "Interest and fees on loans", the same line items in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income as the income on the hedged items. The cash flow hedges were highly effective at September 30, 2024, and changes in the fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness were not material.

 First Commonwealth currently has two trusts, First Commonwealth Capital Trust II and First Commonwealth Capital Trust III, of which 100 of the common equity is owned by First Commonwealth. The trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities solely in junior subordinated debt securities subordinated debentures of First Commonwealth. The subordinated debentures held by each trust are the sole assets of the trust. 
 Interest on the debentures issued to First Commonwealth Capital Trust II is paid quarterly at a floating rate of three-month CME Term SOFR + 0.26161 + 2.85 , which is reset quarterly. Subject to regulatory approval, First Commonwealth may redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, at its option at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption.

 In order to reduce its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to interest payments on First Commonwealth Capital Trust II and III, the Company entered into two interest rate swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. These contracts fix the index rate based portion of the interest rate on Capital Trust III at 1.525 until August 15, 2026. A similar interest rate swap contract was entered for Capital Trust II which fixed the index rate based portion at 1.515 , however that swap expired on August 15, 2024.

million per year, is recognized as received due to the immaterial amount. 
 Retail brokerage income primarily consists of commissions received on annuity and investment product sales through a third-party service provider. The Company s performance obligation is generally satisfied upon the issuance of the annuity policy or the execution of an investment transaction. The Company does not earn a significant amount of trailer fees on annuity sales. However, after considering the factors impacting these trailer fees, such as the uncertainty of investor behavior and changes in the market value of assets, First Commonwealth determined that it would recognize trailing fees as received because it could not reasonably estimate an amount of future trailing commissions for which collection is probable. Commissions from the third-party service provider are received on a monthly basis based upon customer activity for the month. The fees are recognized monthly with a receivable until commissions are received from the third-party service provider the following month. Because the Company acts as an agent in arranging the relationship between the customer and the third-party service provider and does not control the services rendered to the customers, retail brokerage fees are presented net of related costs, including million and million in commission expense as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Card-Related Interchange Income 
 Card-related interchange income is primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, ATM fees and merchant services income. Debit and credit card income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Company s debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks such as MasterCard. ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company cardholder uses a Company ATM. Merchant services income mainly represents fees charged to merchants to process their debit and credit card transactions, in addition to account management fees. Card-related interchange income is recognized daily as the customer transactions are settled. 
 Other Income 
 Other income includes service revenue from processing wire transfers, bill pay service, cashier s checks, and other services. The Company s performance obligation for these services are largely satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when the services are rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month. 
 Gains(losses) on sales of OREO 
 First Commonwealth records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. When First Commonwealth finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, an assessment of whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract is completed along with an evaluation of whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, First Commonwealth adjusts the transaction price and the related gain or loss on sale if a significant financing component is present.

 Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), First Commonwealth management uses, and this quarterly report contains or references, certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance and our business and performance trends as they facilitate comparison with the performance of others in the financial services industry. Although we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. 
 We believe the presentation of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Interest income per the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income is reconciled to net interest income adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis on pages 66 and 74 for nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Results of Operations 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, First Commonwealth had net income of 106.7 million, or 1.04 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of 112.2 million, or 1.10 diluted earnings per share, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of a 6.1 million decrease in net interest income and a 6.0 million increase in the provision for credit losses. Offsetting these items was a 1.6 million increase in noninterest income and a 3.3 million decrease in noninterest expense, the latter of which was primarily due to 8.9 million in expenses related to the Centric acquisition recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s return on average equity was 10.54 and its return on average assets was 1.22 , compared to 12.35 and 1.37 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was 284.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 290.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income can be attributed to a 100 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities offset by a 49 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets. Net interest income comprises the majority of our operating revenue (net interest income before provision expense plus noninterest income), at 79.3 and 80.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 64 

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 
 FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 3.87 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin is affected by changes in the level of interest rates and the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 The taxable equivalent yield on interest-earning assets was 5.63 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 49 basis points compared to the 5.14 yield for the same period in 2023. This change is a result of the higher interest rate environment and resulted in the loan portfolio yield increasing by 47 basis points when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Contributing to this increase was the yield on our adjustable and variable rate commercial loan portfolios, which increased 30 basis points due to the impact on loan repricing and new volumes at higher interest rates. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 8 basis points of the yield on interest-earning assets can be attributed to the recognition of 6.1 million in accretion of purchase accounting marks, primarily from the Centric acquisition. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , accretion of purchase accounting marks contributed 6.9 million , or 9 basis points , to the yield on interest-earning assets. 
 The investment portfolio yield increased 101 basis points in comparison to the prior year as new volume rates were higher than the portfolio yield. The average investment portfolio balance for the period ended September 30, 2024 increased 278.9 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of liquidity from growth in interest-bearing liabilities. The yield on interest-bearing deposits with banks increased 20 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year, while the average balance increased from 197.5 million in 2023 to 199.9 million in 2024. 
 The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.84 for the same period in 2023. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 109 basis points and short-term borrowings decreased 11 basis points in comparison to the same period last year. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits can be attributed to higher market interest rates, as well as changes in the mix of deposits as customers moved funds to take advantage of the increased rates offered in money market and time deposit accounts. Comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with the comparable period in 2023, average time deposits increased 599.2 million, or 67.3 , with an increase in the cost of these deposits of 130 basis points. Other interest-bearing deposits increased on average 116.7 million, or 2.1 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the cost of these deposits increased 88 basis points. Compared to the prior period, short-term borrowings increased an average of 158.0 million in order to provide liquidity and fund growth in loans and investments. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in rates negatively impacted net interest income by 7.0 million when compared with the same period in 2023. The higher yield on interest-earning assets positively impacted net interest income by 44.3 million, while the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities negatively impacted net interest income by 51.3 million. 
 Changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities positively impacted net interest income by 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Higher levels of interest-earning assets resulted in an increase of 20.4 million in interest income, while changes in the volume and mix of interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by 19.5 million. Average interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 661.0 million, or 6.6 , compared to the same period in 2023. Average loans for the comparable period increased 379.7 million, or 4.4 and average investments increased 278.9 million, or 22.7 . 
 Net interest income was negatively impacted by a 190.8 million decrease in average net free funds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. Average net free funds are the excess of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, other noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders equity over noninterest-earning assets. The level of net free funds was impacted by a lower level of noninterest-bearing demand deposits as customers became more rate sensitive and moved their funds into interest-bearing deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 292.7 million, or 11.3 , compared to the same period in 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is determined based on management s estimates of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses needed for expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio and off-balance sheet commitments. The provision for credit losses is an amount added to the allowance, against which credit losses are charged.

 Total provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 6.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase can be attributed to 17.5 million in net charge-offs as well as an increase of 9.2 million in specific reserves. The specific reserves can be attributed to 6.2 million for three non-owner occupied relationships and 2.8 million for a time and demand relationship, all of which were moved to nonaccrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the first nine months of 2023, provision expense of 10.7 million was recognized as the day 1 non-PCD provision expense resulting from the Centric acquisition. A 1.8 million decrease in the provision for off-balance sheet commitments was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of lower off-balance sheet commitments related to construction and time and demand loans. 
 The allowance for credit losses was 126.1 million, or 1.41 , of total loans and leases outstanding at September 30, 2024, compared to 117.7 million, or 1.31 , at December 31, 2023 and 134.3 million, or 1.51 , at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to 0.83 at September 30, 2024 from 0.54 as of September 30, 2023 and 0.44 at December 31, 2023. The allowance to nonperforming loan ratio was 168.77 , 298.23 and 280.31 as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses is at a level deemed appropriate to absorb expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024.

Noninterest Income 
 The following table presents the components of noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30: 
 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Noninterest Income: Trust income 8,790 7,967 823 10 Service charges on deposit accounts 16,769 15,842 927 6 Insurance and retail brokerage commissions 7,618 7,171 447 6 Income from bank owned life insurance 4,943 3,664 1,279 35 Card-related interchange income 17,964 21,422 (3,458) (16) Swap fee income 88 1,029 (941) (91) Other income 7,463 7,114 349 5 Subtotal 63,635 64,209 (574) (1) Net securities losses (5,447) (103) (5,344) 5,188 Gain on VISA exchange and sale 5,664 5,664 Gain on sale of mortgage loans 4,150 3,175 975 31 Gain on sale of other loans and assets 6,035 5,004 1,031 21 Derivatives mark to market (141) 27 (168) (622) Total noninterest income 73,896 72,312 1,584 2 
 Total noninterest income, excluding net securities losses, gain on VISA exchange, gain on sale of mortgage loans, gain on sale of other loans and assets and the derivatives mark to market for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.6 million, or 1 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a 3.5 million decline in card-related interchange income resulting from the Company being subject to the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act beginning July 1, 2024. The Durbin Amendment is now applicable to the Company because its total assets exceeded 10.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. We estimate that the application of the interchange fee cap, as compared to the twelve months prior to the July 1, 2024 effective date, will decrease our interchange income by approximately 6.3 million in 2024 and approximately 12.8 million in 2025. 
 Income from bank owned life insurance increased 1.3 million, of which 1.0 million was related to an increase in policy death benefits. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 0.9 million primarily due to higher business account analysis income and increased customer activity. Trust income increased 0.8 million due to gains in the value of assets under management. Swap fee income declined 0.9 million as a result of a decrease in new interest rate swaps entered into by our commercial loan customers compared to the prior period. 
 Total noninterest income increased 1.6 million, or 2 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The most significant changes, other than the changes noted above, include a 5.7 million gain related to the conversion and sale of Visa class B shares. Gain on sale of mortgages increased 1.0 million as a result of changes in volume and spread received on mortgage loans sold, and gain on sale of other loans and assets increased 1.0 million due to an increase in the volume and spread on the sale of SBA loans. Offsetting these gains are 5.3 million in losses recognized on the sale of 75.1 million in available for sale securities, which were sold in order to reinvest into higher yielding investments.

Noninterest Expense 
 The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30: 
 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Noninterest Expense: Salaries and employee benefits 111,262 106,639 4,623 4 Net occupancy 15,014 14,584 430 3 Furniture and equipment 13,093 12,936 157 1 Data processing 11,543 11,024 519 5 Advertising and promotion 4,177 4,652 (475) (10) Pennsylvania shares tax 3,454 4,013 (559) (14) Intangible amortization 3,656 3,773 (117) (3) Other professional fees and services 3,976 4,376 (400) (9) FDIC insurance 4,537 4,614 (77) (2) Other operating 26,222 25,906 316 1 Subtotal 196,934 192,517 4,417 2 Loss on sale or write-down of assets 352 97 255 263 Litigation and operational losses 3,672 3,263 409 13 Loss on early redemption of subordinated debt 369 369 Merger and acquisition related 114 8,860 (8,746) (99) Total noninterest expense 201,441 204,737 (3,296) (2) 
 Noninterest expense decreased 3.3 million, or 2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily the result of 8.9 million in merger-related expenses associated with the Centric acquisition recognized during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September, 30, 2024, advertising and promotion expense decreased 0.5 million due to the timing and types of advertising in 2024 compared to 2023. Offsetting these decreases is a 4.6 million increase in salaries and benefits expense primarily due to annual merit salary increases, higher severance expense and an increase in the number of full-time employees. The number of full time equivalent employees totaled 1,481 at September 30, 2023 and 1,500 at September 30, 2024. Increases in net occupancy expense can be attributed to insurance costs as well as higher depreciation expenses from new or improved locations. Data processing costs increased 0.5 million due to continued investment in our digital banking and other product offerings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 0.4 million in remaining subordinated debt issuance costs that were being amortized over the life of the instrument were accelerated and recognized in conjunction with the redemption of 50.0 million in subordinated debentures. 
 
 Income Tax 
 The provision for income taxes decreased 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 We applied the annual effective tax rate approach to determine the provision for income taxes, which applies an annual forecast of tax expense as a percentage of expected full year income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 We generate an annual effective tax rate that is less than the statutory rate of 21 due to benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest, income from bank-owned life insurance and tax benefits associated with low income housing tax credits, all of which are relatively consistent regardless of the level of pretax income. These provided for an effective tax rate of 20.1 and 20.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our deferred tax assets totaled 53.2 million. Based on our evaluation, we determined that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. As a result, a valuation allowance against these assets was not recorded. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved forecasts, evaluation of historical earnings levels and consideration of potential tax strategies. If future events differ from our current forecasts, we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, First Commonwealth recognized net income of 32.1 million, or 0.31 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of 39.2 million, or 0.38 diluted earnings per share, in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of a 1.2 million decrease in net interest income, a 4.7 million increase in the provision for credit losses and a 2.7 million increase in noninterest expense. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s return on average equity was 9.19 and its return on average assets was 1.08 , compared to 12.46 and 1.38 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was 96.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 98.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income can be attributed to a 63 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities offset by a 31 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets. Net interest income comprises the majority of our operating revenue (i.e., net interest income before provision expense plus noninterest income), at 79.6 and 79.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was 3.56 and 3.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The taxable equivalent yield on interest-earning assets was 5.68 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 31 basis points compared to the 5.37 yield for the same period in 2023. This is largely due to a 30 basis point increase in the loan portfolio yield when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of a higher repricing rates in 2024. Also contributing to this increase is the growth in average loans of 120.1 million. Additionally, accretion of purchase accounting marks, primarily related to the Centric acquisition, contributed 2.0 million or 7 basis points to the yield on interest-earnings assets in the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, accretion of purchase accounting marks contributed 2.4 million , or 9 basis points , to the yield on interest-earning assets. 
 The investment portfolio yield increased 102 basis points in comparison to the prior year as new volume rates were higher than the portfolio yield. The average investment portfolio balance increased 313.5 million as a result of liquidity from growth in interest-bearing liabilities. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks increased from 235.8 million in 2023 to 278.0 million in 2024, while the yield decreased 14 basis points. 
 The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.91 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.28 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the cost of time deposits and savings deposits. The cost of interest-bearing demand deposits increased 46 basis points and short-term borrowings decreased 61 basis points in comparison to the same period last year. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing demand deposits can be attributed to higher market interest rates and changes in the mix of deposits as customers moved funds to take advantage of the increased rates on money market and time deposits. Comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 with the comparable period in 2023, average time deposits increased 521.8 million, or 49.5 , with an increase in the cost of these deposits of 92 basis points. Other interest-bearing deposits increased on average 76.2 million, or 1.4 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the cost of those deposits increased 60 basis points. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, changes in interest rates negatively impacted net interest income by 0.7 million when compared with the same period in 2023. The higher yield on loans contributed to interest-earning assets positively impacting net interest income by 10.3 million, while an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities negatively impacted net interest income by 11.0 million. 
 Changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities negatively impacted net interest income by 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The mix of interest-earning assets resulted in an increase of 4.2 million in interest income, while changes in the volume and mix of interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense by 4.7 million. Average interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 475.8 million, or 4.6 , compared to the same period in 2023. Average loans for the comparable period increased 120.1 million, or 1.4 . Average time deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 521.8 million compared to the comparable period in 2023, increasing interest expense by 4.6 million.

Net interest income was negatively impacted by a 108.4 million decrease in average net free funds for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. Average net free funds are the excess of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, other noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders equity over noninterest-earning assets. The decline in the level of net free funds was primarily the result of a decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which decreased 232.7 million, as a result of customers becoming more rate sensitive due to higher interest rates.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is determined based on management s estimates of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses needed for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, after giving consideration to charge-offs and recoveries for the period. The provision for credit losses is an amount added to the allowance, against which credit losses are charged.

 The provision for credit losses on loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023 by 6.5 million. The level of provision expense in the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by specific reserves for two commercial loans moved to nonaccrual status during the period, resulting in 5.5 million in specific reserves. Additionally, the provision expense reflected 8.8 million in net charges-offs, of which 5.1 million related to two commercial borrowers and resulted in 1.5 million of provision expense for the quarter. The provision for off-balance sheet credit exposure decreased 1.7 million primarily due to the level of unfunded commitments for construction and time and demand. 
 
 The level of provision expense in the third quarter of 2023 was primarily the result of an increase in loan balances and an additional 4.1 million in specific reserves for a commercial real estate loan as a result of an updated appraisal. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 4.0 million.

 Total noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The most significant change includes a 3.1 million decrease in card-related interchange income primarily due to the Durbin Amendment, which impacted the Company beginning July 1, 2024. Swap fee income declined

0.4 million as a result of a reduction in new swaps entered by our commercial customers. Offsetting these decreases is a 1.0 million increase in income from bank owned life insurance, primarily due to policy death benefits and a 0.4 million increase in insurance and retail brokerage income due to growth in annuity sales. Additionally, gain on sale of other loans and assets increased 1.5 million due to the volume and spread related to the sale of SBA loans. 
 
 Noninterest Expense 
 The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30: 
 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Noninterest Expense: Salaries and employee benefits 38,618 35,640 2,978 8 Net occupancy 4,858 4,782 76 2 Furniture and equipment 4,335 4,414 (79) (2) Data processing 3,879 3,857 22 1 Advertising and promotion 1,960 1,662 298 18 Pennsylvania shares tax 1,126 1,588 (462) (29) Intangible amortization 1,223 1,344 (121) (9) Other professional fees and services 1,448 1,603 (155) (10) FDIC insurance 1,638 1,920 (282) (15) Other operating 8,672 8,548 124 1 Subtotal 67,757 65,358 2,399 4 Loss on sale or write-down of assets 132 50 82 164 Litigation and operational losses 2,181 1,626 555 34 Merger and acquisition related 379 (379) (100) Total noninterest expense 70,070 67,413 2,657 4 
 
 Noninterest expense increased 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily a result of a 3.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense due to annual merit increases, increased severance expense and a higher number of full time equivalent employees. 
 
 Income Tax 
 The provision for income taxes decreased 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The effective tax rate increased 40 basis points from 20.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 20.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 We applied the annual effective tax rate approach to determine the provision for income taxes, which applies an annual forecast of tax expense as a percentage of expected full year income, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs, with cost-effective funding. We generate funds to meet these needs primarily through the core deposit base of First Commonwealth Bank and the maturity or repayment of loans and other interest-earning assets, including investments. During the first nine months of 2024, the sale, maturity and redemption of investment securities provided 253.1 million in liquidity. These funds contributed to the liquidity available to originate loans, purchase investment securities and fund depositor withdrawals.

 (1) Reflects internal policy limit. Maximum capacity with CDARs is 1.8 billion. 
 Our participation in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services CDARS program is part of an Asset/Liability Committee ALCO strategy to increase and diversify funding sources. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding CDARS balance of 17.6 million carried an average weighted rate of 3.53 and an average original term of 364 days. These deposits are part of a reciprocal program that allows our depositors to receive expanded FDIC coverage by placing multiple certificates of deposit at other CDARS member banks. 
 Liquidity available through the Federal Reserve is a result of the FRB Borrower-in-Custody of Collateral program, which enables us to take certain loans that are not being used as collateral at the FHLB and pledge them as collateral for borrowings at the FRB. During the first quarter of 2024, borrowings of 516.0 million at a rate of 4.76 were originated under the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program in order to fund growth in loans and investments. These borrowings have a maturity date of January 16, 2025, and can be repaid without penalty at any time. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company paid off 436.0 million of the borrowings under the Bank Term Funding Program. 
 First Commonwealth s long-term liquidity source is its core deposit base. Core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long-term relationship with a deposit customer. The following table shows a breakdown of the components of First Commonwealth s deposits: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Noninterest-bearing demand deposits (a) 
 2,463,971 2,388,533 Interest-bearing demand deposits (a)

 (a) Balances include reallocations from noninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits into savings deposits, which were made for regulatory purposes. 
 The level of deposits during any period is influenced by factors outside of management s control, such as the level of short-term and long-term market interest rates and yields offered on competing investments, such as money market mutual funds. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, total deposits increased 553.2 million. Interest-bearing demand and savings deposits increased 109.0 million, time deposits increased 368.9 million and noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased 75.4 million. 
 The estimated total of uninsured deposits was 2.8 billion and 2.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which 0.9 billion and 0.8 billion were secured by pledged investment securities or letters of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Uninsured amounts are estimated based on known account relationships for each depositor and insurance guidelines provided by the FDIC.

Market Risk 
 The following gap analysis compares the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time. The ratio of rate-sensitive assets to rate-sensitive liabilities repricing within a one-year period was 0.70 and 0.69 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A ratio of less than one indicates a higher level of repricing liabilities over repricing assets over the next twelve months. The level of First Commonwealth's ratio is largely driven by the modeling of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits, which are included in the analysis as repricing within one year. 
 Gap analysis has limitations due to the static nature of the model that holds volumes and consumer behaviors constant in all economic and interest rate scenarios. A lower level of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities repricing in one year could indicate reduced net interest income in a rising interest rate scenario, and conversely, increased net interest income in a declining interest rate scenario. However, the gap analysis incorporates only the level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and not the sensitivity each has to changes in interest rates. The impact of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates is provided in the table below the gap analysis.

 The Company evaluates its potential interest rate sensitivity by utilizing multiple interest rate scenarios that incorporate both rising and declining rates. Results of these scenarios are impacted by variables that include the current level of interest rates, product characteristics such as floors and ceilings, the frequency with which variable rate products reset their rates, and projected pricing changes for non-maturity deposits. For example, the results in a declining rate scenario could be affected by the model's use of an assumed interest rate floor of zero. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities averaged 2.84 and 1.84 , respectively, and the yield on our average interest-earning assets, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, averaged 5.63 and 5.14 , respectively. 
 Asset/liability models require that certain assumptions be made, such as prepayment rates on earning assets and the impact of pricing on non-maturity deposits, which may differ from actual experience. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans and published industry experience. While management believes such assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that modeled results will approximate actual results. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Management of credit risk within our loan and lease portfolio is a focus of the Company and is a continuous process in order to address changing economic and lending environments. In order to identify and manage credit risk, segment and concentration limits are established and approved by our Board of Directors Risk Committee in order to maintain alignment with our credit risk appetite, loan strategic plan, loan policy and underwriting guidelines. In addition, our Credit Department completes industry studies to identify potential risk in the portfolio. For example, within the commercial real estate portfolio, industry studies are completed for the following sectors: hospitality, industrial, multifamily, office, retail, senior living, healthcare and student housing. 
 On an annual basis, the Credit Department also reviews the commercial real estate portfolio as a whole, along with underwriting practices and loan level stress testing procedures, to enhance risk management practices and monitor commercial real estate concentrations. This review provides an overview of the portfolio to ensure that emerging risks have been identified, and documents and validates the standard interest rate and capitalization rate stress scenarios. 
 First Commonwealth maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level deemed sufficient for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio at the date of each statement of financial condition. Management reviews the appropriateness of the allowance on a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for credit losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 
 FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

First Commonwealth s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements. These elements include an assessment of individual nonperforming loans with a balance greater than 250 thousand, loss experience trends and other relevant factors. 
 First Commonwealth also maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based upon credit risk and probability of funding. The reserve totaled 4.1 million at September 30, 2024 and is classified in "Other liabilities" on the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 We discontinue interest accruals on a loan when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to fully collect principal or interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. A loan is also placed on nonaccrual status when, based on regulatory definitions, the loan is maintained on a cash basis due to the weakened financial condition of the borrower. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status, except for consumer loans, which are placed on nonaccrual status at 150 days past due. Consumer loans related to automobile and recreational vehicles are either charged off or repossessed at no later than 90 days past due. 
 Nonperforming loans are closely monitored on an ongoing basis as part of our loan review and work-out process. The probable risk of loss on these loans is evaluated by comparing the loan balance to the fair value of any underlying collateral or the present value of projected future cash flows. Losses or a specifically assigned allowance for loan losses are recognized where appropriate. 
 Nonperforming loans and leases, including loans held for sale, increased 35.3 million to 74.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 39.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans is primarily a result of 54.2 million in commercial loans that were moved to nonaccrual during the first nine months of 2024. Offsetting these additions is the payoff or sale of 12.8 million for five commercial real estate relationships and the payoff of two commercial, financial, agricultural and other relationships totaling 1.3 million. 
 The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 168.77 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 298.23 at December 31, 2023, and 280.31 at September 30, 2023. The amount of individually assessed reserves included in the allowance for nonperforming loans and leases was determined by using fair values obtained from current appraisals and updated discounted cash flow analyses. The allowance for credit losses includes specific reserves of 14.3 million and general reserves of 111.8 million as of September 30, 2024. Specific reserves increased 9.2 million from December 31, 2023, and decreased 2.4 million from September 30, 2023. The increase from December 31, 2023 is primarily due to 9.0 million in specific reserves related to loans moved to nonaccrual during the period. The decrease from September 30, 2023 is due to the charge-off of 6.4 million related to three commercial, financial, agricultural and other relationships, all of which were fully reserved, and the payoff of loans releasing 4.4 million in specific reserves. Offsetting these are specific reserves on loans moved to nonaccrual of 6.2 million. 
 Criticized loans totaled 242.0 million at September 30, 2024 and represented 2.7 of the loan portfolio. The level of criticized loans increased as of September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023, by 31.8 million, or 15 . Classified loans totaled 114.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 87.1 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 27.7 million, or 32 . The increase in classified loans can be attributed to the increase in nonperforming loans. 
 The allowance for credit losses was 126.1 million at September 30, 2024, or 1.41 of total loans and leases outstanding, compared to 1.31 reported at December 31, 2023, and 1.51 at September 30, 2023. General reserves, or the portion of the allowance related to loans that were not specifically evaluated, as a percentage of performing loans were 1.26 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.26 at December 31, 2023 and 1.33 at September 30, 2023.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loans decreased 3.3 million compared to balances outstanding at December 31, 2023. 
 Real estate construction loans decreased 57.0 million, or 9.5 , due to the completion of commercial real estate projects that subsequently received permanent financing. Residential real estate decreased 42.5 million, or 1.8 , primarily due to sales of closed-end 1-4 family mortgage loans originated for sale. Commercial real estate loans increased 16.3 million, or 0.5 , as a result of growth in loans secured by nonresidential property, due in part to the completion of several construction projects. Loans to individuals decreased 6.3 million, or 0.5 , primarily due to declines in the automobile and recreational vehicles portfolio as well as the personal lines of credit portfolio. Commercial, financial, agricultural and other loans increased 86.2 million, or 5.6 , primarily due to growth in the equipment finance portfolio.

 The office portfolio comprises 17 of total commercial real estate loans and 33 of total commercial real estate non-pass loans. The average loan commitment size for the office portfolio is 1.0 million and the average outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024 is 0.9 million. Within the office portfolio, exposures over 1.0 million have an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.48x, which exceeds our internal guidelines of 1.35x to 1.40x, depending on property class. Additionally, for loans with exposure over 1.0 million, the office portfolio has an average loan to value of 62.1 compared to internal guidelines of 60-75 , depending on property class. Our current measure is based off of the most recent appraisal on file, the majority of which are from origination. 
 As previously noted, portfolio segment limits are approved by our Board of Directors' Risk Committee. These segment limits incorporate loan commitments and are based off of total Tier 1 capital plus the allowable allowance for credit losses. In the second quarter of 2024, after considering the current environment and potential risks related to the office portfolio, the segment

 The following table summarizes commercial real estate loans by the location of the properties by which they are collateralized as of September 30, 2024. Some loans are collateralized by multiple properties spread over various states. In those instances, the loan is included below based on the location of the primary property collateralizing the loan.

 Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, shareholders equity was 1.4 billion, an increase of 95.3 million from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of 106.7 million in net income and a 28.7 million increase in the fair value of available for sale investments and interest rate swaps, which is reflected in the Other Comprehensive Income component of capital. Other items impacting capital include an increase due to 3.9 million in treasury stock sales and decreases due to 39.4 million of dividends paid to shareholders and 4.6 million of common stock repurchases. Cash dividends declared per common share were 0.385 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

First Commonwealth and First Commonwealth Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on First Commonwealth s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, First Commonwealth and First Commonwealth Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of First Commonwealth s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. First Commonwealth s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. 
 Effective January 1, 2015, the Company became subject to the new regulatory risk-based capital rules adopted by the federal banking agencies implementing Basel III. The most significant changes included higher minimum capital requirements, as the minimum Tier I capital ratio increased from 4.0 to 6.0 and a new common equity Tier I capital ratio was established with a minimum level of 4.5 . Additionally, the rules improved the quality of capital by providing stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and provide for a phase-in, beginning January 1, 2016, of a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets. This buffer, which was fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019, provides a requirement to hold common equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements, resulting in an effective common equity Tier I risk-weighted asset minimum ratio of 7.0 on a fully phased-in basis. 
 The Basel III Rules also permit banking organizations with less than 15.0 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Company elected to retain this treatment, which reduces the volatility of regulatory capital levels. 
 In 2018, First Commonwealth Bank, the Company's banking subsidiary, issued 100 million in subordinated debt, of which 50 million remained outstanding at September 30, 2024, which under the regulatory rules qualifies as Tier II capital. As of September 30, 2024, this subordinated debt issuance increased the total risk-based capital ratio by 53 basis points. 
 In March 2020, regulators issued interim financial rule IFR Regulatory Capital Rule: Revised Transition of the Current Expected Losses Methodology for Allowances in response to the disrupted economic activity from the pandemic. The IFR provides financial institutions that adopt CECL during 2020 with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided by the initial two-year delay five-year transition ). The Company adopted CECL effective January 1, 2020 and elected to implement the five-year transition. Regulatory capital levels without the capital benefit at September 30, 2024 for both First Commonwealth and First Commonwealth Bank would have continued to be greater than the amounts needed to be considered well capitalized , as the transition provided a capital benefit of approximatel y 5 to 6 b asis points. 
 As of September 30, 2024, First Commonwealth and First Commonwealth Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and were considered well-capitalized under the regulatory rules. To be considered well capitalized, the Company must maintain minimum Total risk-based capital, Tier I risk-based capital, Tier I leverage ratio and Common equity tier I risk-based capital as set forth in the table below: Actual Minimum Capital Required Required to be Considered Well Capitalized Capital Amount Ratio Capital Amount Ratio Capital Amount Ratio (dollars in thousands) Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets First Commonwealth Financial Corporation 1,352,337 14.50 979,228 10.50 932,598 10.00 First Commonwealth Bank 1,249,560 13.43 977,220 10.50 930,685 10.00 Tier I Capital to Risk Weighted Assets First Commonwealth Financial Corporation 1,186,365 12.72 792,708 8.50 746,078 8.00 First Commonwealth Bank 1,083,824 11.65 791,082 8.50 744,548 8.00 Tier I Capital to Average Assets First Commonwealth Financial Corporation 1,186,365 10.31 460,492 4.00 575,615 5.00 First Commonwealth Bank 1,083,824 9.44 459,432 4.00 574,290 5.00 Common Equity Tier I to Risk Weighted Assets First Commonwealth Financial Corporation 1,116,365 11.97 652,820 7.00 606,189 6.50 First Commonwealth Bank 1,083,824 11.65 651,480 7.00 604,945 6.50 
 On October 29, 2024, First Commonwealth Financial Corporation declared a quarterly dividend of 0.13 per share payable on November 22, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2024. The timing and amount of future dividends are at the

discretion of First Commonwealth's Board of Directors based upon, among other factors, capital levels, asset quality, liquidity and current and projected earnings. 
 In October 2021, a share repurchase program was authorized by the Board of Directors for up to an additional 25.0 million in shares of the Company's common stock. On April 24, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a 25 million increase in the share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, 2,661,388 common shares had been repurchased under these program at an average price of 13.28 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 169,811 common shares were repurchased under these programs at an average price of 16.24 per share.
