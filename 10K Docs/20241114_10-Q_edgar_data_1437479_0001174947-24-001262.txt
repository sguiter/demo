The ACL is maintained at a level
determined to be adequate to absorb estimated expected credit losses within the loan portfolio over the contractual life of an instrument
that considers historical loss experience, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions as of the balance sheet date.
The Corporation develops and documents a systematic ACL methodology based on the following portfolio segments: Agriculture, Business Loans,
Consumer Loans, Home Equity, Non-Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate (CRE), and Residential Real Estate. The following are key
risks within each portfolio segment: 

Agriculture Loans
made to individuals or operating companies within the Agricultural industry. These loans are generally secured by a first lien mortgage
on agricultural land. The primary source of repayment is the income and assets of the borrower. The condition of the agriculture
industry as well as the condition of the national economy is an important indicator of risk for this segment. 

Business Loans Loans
made to operating companies or manufacturers for the purpose of production, operating capacity, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment
financing. The primary source of repayment for these loans is cash flow from the operations of the company. The condition
of the national economy is an important indicator of risk, but there are also more specific risks depending on the industry of the company.
This segment also includes loans made to finance construction of buildings or other structures, as well as to finance the acquisition
and development of raw land for various purposes. While the risk of these loans is generally confined to the construction period, if there
are problems, the project may not be completed, and as such, may not provide sufficient cash flow on its own to service the debt or have
sufficient value in a liquidation to cover the outstanding principal. The condition of the national economy is an important indicator
of risk, but there are also more specific risks depending on the type of project and the experience and resources of the developer. 

Consumer - Loans
made to individuals that may be secured by assets other than 1-4 family residences, as well as unsecured loans. This segment includes
personal loans and lines of credit that may be secured or unsecured. The primary source of repayment for these loans is the income
and assets of the borrower. The condition of the national 

 economy, in particular the unemployment
rate, is an important indicator of risk for this segment. The value of the collateral, if there is any, is less likely to be a source
of repayment due to less certain collateral values. 

Home Equity This
segment generally includes lines of credit and term loans secured by the equity in the borrower s residence. The primary
source of repayment for these facilities is the income and assets of the borrower. The condition of the national economy, in particular
the unemployment rate, is an important indicator of risk for this segment. The state of the national housing market can also have a significant
impact on this segment because low demand and/or declining home values can limit the ability of borrowers to sell a property and satisfy
the debt. 

Non-Owner Occupied CRE
- Loans secured by commercial purpose real estate for various purposes such as hotels, retail, multifamily and health care. The
primary sources of repayment for these loans are the operations of the individual projects and global cash flows of the debtors. The condition
of the national economy is an important indicator of risk, but there are also more specific risks depending on the collateral type and
the business prospects of the lessee. 

Residential Real Estate Loans
secured by first liens on 1-4 family residential mortgages. The primary source of repayment for these loans is the income and assets of
the borrower. The condition of the national economy, in particular the unemployment rate, is an important indicator of risk for this segment.
The state of the national housing market can also have a significant impact on this segment because low demand and/or declining home values
can limit the ability of borrowers to sell a property and satisfy the debt.

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial
Difficulty 

 The Corporation may grant a modification to borrowers
in financial distress by providing a temporary reduction in interest rate, or an extension of a loan s stated maturity date. Loan
modifications are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. 

The Corporation identifies loans for potential
restructure primarily through direct communication with the borrower and evaluation of the borrower's financial statements, revenue projections,
tax returns, and credit reports. Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow
shortages, adverse economic conditions, and negative trends may result in a payment default in the near future. There was one modification
of a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty in the amount of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

and observable, but not necessarily quotes on identical securities traded in active markets on a daily basis. The Corporation s
U.S. Treasury bonds, CRA fund investments, and bank stocks are fair valued utilizing level I inputs because the funds have their own quoted
prices in an active market. 

The following tables provide the fair value for each class of assets
required to be measured and reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, by level within the fair value hierarchy:

These amounts were included in the fair value of closed portfolios
of available-for-sale investment securities used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is in the stated amount of
assets in the closed portfolios anticipated to be outstanding for the designated hedge period. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value
of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was million. As of September 30, 2024, the notional amount of hedged
assets was million. 

The Corporation is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate
assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Corporation entered into pay-fixed and receive-floating interest rate swaps to
manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of its available-for-sale investment securities. These interest rate swaps are designated
as fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method. The Corporation receives variable-rate interest payments in exchange for making
fixed-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts. The fair value hedges are recorded as components
of other assets and other liabilities in the Corporation s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss on these derivatives,
as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income in the Corporation s
unaudited consolidated statements of income.

Results of Operations 

Overview 

The Corporation recorded net income of 3,336,000 for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024, a 277,000, or 7.7 decrease from the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income
for the nine-month period was 11,591,000, a 3,740,000, or 47.6 increase over earnings in the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023. The earnings per share, basic and diluted, were 0.59 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.64 for
the same period in 2023, and for the year-to-date period, earnings per share were 2.05, compared to 1.39 in 2023, or a 47.5 
increase over the comparable nine-month period in the previous year. 

The Corporation s net interest
income (NII) increased by 812,000, or 6.1 , and 717,000, or 1.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the same periods in 2023. Interest and fees on loans increased by 2,752,000, or 17.3 , and 9,359,000, or 21.0 , for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Conversely, interest expense on deposits and borrowings
increased by 2,657,000, or 39.8 , and 9,954,000, or 62.2 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same
periods in the prior year. 

The Corporation recorded a provision for
credit losses of 497,000 in the third quarter of 2024, and a release of provision expense of 354,000 for the year-to-date period,
compared to a release of provision expense of 504,000 in the third quarter of 2023 and a year-to-date provision expense of
 1,568,000 through September 30, 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, there was a significant change in the forward credit
outlook due primarily to a high interest rate environment and declining economic conditions. These forward economic
indicators improved substantially moving into 2024 resulting in the release of provision expense for the year-to-date period. The
allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.04 as of September 30, 2024, 1.12 as of December 31, 2023, and 1.22 as of
September 30, 2023. 

Other income increased by 984,000,
or 27.7 , and 4,655,000, or 53.9 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior
year. All categories of other income showed increases for both the quarter
and year-to-date periods. 

Total operating expenses increased by
 1,091,000, or 8.4 , and 2,487,000, or 6.4 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023.
Salary and benefit expenses, which make up the largest portion of operating expenses, increased by 1,294,000, or 17.6 , and 2,612,000,
or 11.5 , for these time periods, due to the competitive labor market and the cost to hire and retain qualified talent. Other operating
expenses outside of salaries and benefits did not change significantly since the prior year. 

The financial services industry uses two primary performance measurements
to gauge performance: return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE). ROA measures how efficiently a bank generates
income based on the amount of assets or size of a company. ROE measures the efficiency of a company in generating income based on the
amount of equity or capital utilized. The ROA and ROE decreased for the quarter-to-date period due to slightly lower earnings, but increased
for the year-to-date period, due to higher earnings in 2024.

The results of the Corporation s operations are best explained
by addressing, in further detail, the five major sections of the income statement, which are as follows: 

Net interest income 

Provision for credit losses 

Other income 

Operating expenses 

Provision for income taxes 

The following discussion analyzes each of these five
components. 

Net Interest Income (NII) 

NII represents the largest portion of the Corporation s
operating income. In the first nine months of 2024, NII generated 75.8 of the Corporation s revenue stream, which consists of
NII and non-interest income. This compared to 82.5 for the first nine months of 2023. This decrease is a result of higher levels of
non-interest income in the first nine months of 2024 resulting in NII contributing to a smaller portion of total revenue. The
overall performance of the Corporation is highly dependent on the changes in NII since it comprises such a significant portion of
operating income. 

The following table shows a summary analysis of NII on a fully taxable
equivalent (FTE) basis. For analytical purposes and throughout this discussion, yields, rates, and measurements such as NII, net interest
spread, and net yield on interest earning assets are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE NII shown in both tables below will exceed the
NII reported on the consolidated statements of income, which is not shown on an FTE basis. The amount of FTE adjustment totaled 75,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 279,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 135,000 and 491,000
for the same periods in 2023.

NII is the difference between interest income earned on assets and
interest expense incurred on liabilities. Accordingly, two factors affect NII: 

The rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities 

The average balance of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

31 

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

NII is impacted by yields earned on assets and rates paid on
liabilities. During 2023, asset yields increased with the increases in Federal Reserve rates, but liability costs increased even
more dramatically as rates were held lower during 2022 when the Fed first started increasing rates and then moved much higher in
2023 due to liquidity needs and the desire to preserve deposit balances. Market interest rates have stabilized and moderated in 2024
but the Corporation is still feeling the lingering effects of the prior rate movements as customers continue to move funds to higher
yielding deposit products. While higher market rates have helped the Corporation s asset yields, the higher cost of funds has
put pressure on the NIM causing slight compression. Management believes this compression will moderate through the remainder of 2024
as the cost of funds has started to decline and asset yields are stable. 

The Corporation s net interest margin remained stable at 2.89 
for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same quarter in 2023, but for the year-to-date period, the Corporation s
margin was 2.86 , compared to 2.99 for the year-to-date period in 2023. The Corporation s NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis
increased by 752,000, or 5.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 505,000, or 1.2 , for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 

The Corporation s overall cost of funds rose significantly
throughout 2023 and into 2024. Core
deposit interest rates have risen over the past year; however, time deposit rates have risen to higher levels and more quickly than
core deposit rates. The change in deposit rates has resulted in some movement from low interest bearing core deposits to higher cost
time deposits or other higher yielding money market deposits. This resulted in the total cost of deposits increasing by 2,627,000
for the quarter and 9,605,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The
average balance of borrowings was slightly lower for the third quarter, but slightly higher for the first nine months of 2024
compared to 2023, and interest rates were higher, resulting in the total cost of borrowings increasing by 30,000, and 349,000, for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 

The following table provides an analysis of year-to-date changes in
NII on a FTE basis by distinguishing what changes were a result of average balance increases or decreases and what changes were a result
of interest rate increases or decreases.

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

The Corporation s average balances on securities decreased by
 1.0 million, or 0.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 34.6 million, or 6.4 , for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The tax equivalent yield on investments increased by three basis points for the quarter-to-date
period and 13 basis points for the year-to-date period when comparing both years. Interest income on securities increased by 32,000,
or 0.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 284,000, or 2.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Average balances on loans increased by 80.6 million, or 6.1 , for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 109.8 million, or 8.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the
same periods in the prior year. Loan yields increased by 53 basis points for the quarter and year-to-date period and loan interest income
increased by 2,762,000, or 17.3 , and 9,364,000, or 20.9 , for both time frames due to the increase in loan balances and higher yields. 

The average balance of interest-bearing deposit accounts increased
by 110.7 million, or 10.5 , and 119.3 million, or 11.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared
to the same periods in the prior year. Total interest-bearing deposits increased as rates increased due to funds shifting from non-interest
earning accounts to interest earning accounts due to the rapid increase in market rates. The average balance of savings accounts decreased
as funds moved into higher-yielding time deposit accounts. The interest rate paid on all interest-bearing deposits increased significantly
for both time periods. The combined rate on interest-bearing deposits increased by 70 basis points for the quarter ended September 30,
2024, and 96 basis points for the year-to-date period, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The combination of these changes
resulted in an increase in interest expense on deposits of 2,627,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 9,603,000,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 

The Corporation s average balance on borrowed funds decreased
by 7,519,000, or 5.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 436,000, or 0.3 , for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The Corporation s borrowed funds consist of FHLB advances as well as subordinated
debt issued in December of 2020 and July of 2022 which was used to support capital growth for the Corporation. The rate paid on borrowed
funds increased by 31 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 34 basis points for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net interest spread
decreased by 21 basis points to 1.88 , compared to 2.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the net interest spread decreased by 39 basis points to 1.90 , compared to 2.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The effect of non-interest bearing funds increased to 101 basis points from 80 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
and increased to 96 basis points from 70 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023.
The effect of non-interest bearing funds refers to the benefit gained from deposits on which the Corporation does not pay interest. As
rates go higher, the benefit of non-interest bearing deposits increases because there is more difference between non-interest bearing
funds and interest bearing liabilities. The Corporation s NIM for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.89 , compared to 2.89 for the
third quarter of 2023. For the year-to-date period, the Corporation s NIM was 2.86 , compared to 2.99 for the same period in 2023. 

The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) carefully monitors the NIM because
it indicates trends in NII, the Corporation s largest source of revenue. For more information on the plans and strategies in place
to protect the NIM and moderate the impact of changes in rates, refer to Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses includes a provision for losses on
loans, available-for-sale debt securities, and unfunded loan commitments. The provision provides for losses inherent in the financial
assets as determined by a quarterly analysis and calculation of various factors related to the financial assets. The amount of the provision
reflects the adjustment management determines necessary to ensure the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) is adequate to cover any losses
inherent in the financial assets. The Corporation recorded a release of provision expense of 400,000 for credit losses related to loans,
a provision expense of 46,000 for unfunded commitments, and 0 related to available-for-sale securities for the first nine months of
2024, compared to provision expense of 1,469,000 related to loans, 99,000 for unfunded commitments, and 0 related to available-for-sale
securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, there was less economic impact in the forward
credit outlook due to improving economic indicators allowing the release of provision expense. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance
as a percentage of total loans was 1.05 , compared to 1.22 at September 30, 2023. More detail is provided under Allowance for Credit
Losses in the Financial Condition section that follows. 

Other Income 

Other income for the third quarter of 2024 was 4,539,000, an increase

30, 2024, other income totaled 13,286,000, an increase of 4,655,000, or 53.9 , compared to the same period in 2023. The following tables

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Trust and investment services income increased for the quarter and year-to-date as a result of higher levels of assets under management
and the gain on sale of a limited number of trust assets. Service charges on deposit accounts
increased for both time periods driven primarily by fees earned on an off-balance-sheet sweep product. Commissions are higher for both
time periods as a result of higher income on debit card interchange transactions. The Corporation incurred 211,000 of gains on debt and
equity securities in the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the sale of several bank stock positions, and 17,000 of losses for the
year-to-date period as a result of strategic sales of debt securities to fund higher yielding loan growth. This compared to net losses
of 103,000, and 1,769,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of a higher volume of debt security sales
to fund loan growth in the prior year. Mortgage gains increased by 189,000, or 105.0 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the
third quarter of 2023, and 885,000, or 174.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This
was primarily a result of the strategic decision to generate more mortgage volume for sale on the secondary market as opposed to held
for investment on the Corporation s balance sheet. Earnings on bank owned life insurance were higher by 34,000, or 13.9 , and 271,000,
or 38.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of a death
benefit received in the second quarter of 2024. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 14,124,000,
an increase of 1,091,000, or 8.4 , compared to the 13,033,000 for the third quarter of 2023. For the year-to-date period ended September
30, 2024, operating expenses totaled 41,086,000, an increase of 2,487,000, or 6.4 , compared to the same period in 2023. The following

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Salaries and employee benefits are the largest category of operating
expenses. For the third quarter of 2024, salaries and benefits increased 1,294,000, or 17.6 , and for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, salaries and benefits increased 2,612,000, or 11.5 , compared to the same periods in 2023. This was primarily due to a competitive
labor market that resulted in higher costs to attract and retain employees inclusive of costs related to merit increases, costs related
to accruing for a bank-wide annual incentive plan, and higher employee benefit expenses. Advertising and marketing expenses were lower
by 16,000, or 4.1 , and 258,000, or 24.0 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year. This
decrease was primarily related to lower costs related to various media advertising channels. Computer software and data processing expenses
decreased by 248,000, or 13.8 , and 559,000, or 10.6 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of a debit
card conversion in 2023 that resulted in amortized contract costs. Shares tax expense is based on the Corporation s level of shareholders 
equity and has increased due to the increase in the Corporation s level of shareholders equity. Other operating expenses
increased by 106,000, or 9.1 , and 512,000, or 18.0 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods
in the prior year due largely to higher FDIC insurance costs and a larger amount of charitable contributions. 

Income Taxes 

Federal income tax expense was 752,000 for the third quarter of 2024
compared to 771,000 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded Federal income
tax expense of 2,499,000, compared to 1,432,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the Corporation
was 17.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 15.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Certain items of income
are not subject to Federal income tax, such as tax-exempt interest income on loans and securities, and Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI)
income; therefore, the effective income tax rate for the Corporation is lower than the stated tax rate.

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Financial Condition 

Investment Securities 

The Corporation classifies all of its debt securities as available
for sale and reports the portfolio at fair value. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had 517.8 million of debt securities available
for sale, which accounted for 24.7 of assets, compared to 23.0 as of December 31, 2023, and 23.0 as of September 30, 2023. Based on
ending balances, the debt securities portfolio increased 18.2 from September 30, 2023, and 12.7 from December 31, 2023. 

The debt securities portfolio was showing a net unrealized loss
of 33,332,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 43,488,000 as of December 31, 2023, and 66,736,000 as of September 30, 2023.
The valuation of the Corporation s debt securities portfolio is impacted by both the U.S.
Treasury rates and the perceived forward direction of interest rates. Additionally, the Corporation sold approximately 61 million of available-for-sale debt securities in 2023 to fund higher yielding loan
growth. The sale of these bonds also resulted in less exposure to unrealized losses with interest rate fluctuations, resulting in an improvement
from September 30, 2023, to September 30, 2024. 

Each quarter, management sets portfolio allocation guidelines and adjusts
the security portfolio strategy generally based on the following factors: 

ALCO positions as to liquidity, credit risk, interest rate risk, and fair value risk 

Growth of the loan portfolio 

Slope of the U.S. Treasury curve 

Relative performance of the various instruments, including spread to U.S. Treasuries 

Duration and average length of the portfolio 

Volatility of the portfolio 

Direction of interest rates 

Economic factors impacting debt securities 

The investment policy of the Corporation establishes guidelines to
promote diversification within the portfolio. The diversity specifications provide opportunities to shorten or lengthen duration, maximize
yield, and mitigate credit risk. 

The Corporation s U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency
sectors remained stable during the first nine months of 2024 with little movement in balances. These sectors represent safe credits,
but carry a lower yield due to the investments made in 2020 and 2021 when rates were lower. 

The Corporation s U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO) have changed since December 31, 2023, with MBS decreasing 3.4 million, or 8.6 , and CMOs
increasing 38.8 million, or 195.8 . The increase in the CMO sector was primarily related to an investment strategy based on purchasing
low coupon, deeply discounted bonds to achieve an above-market yield, while offsetting the interest rate risk with a pay-fixed interest
rate swap. MBS and CMOs both consist of mortgage instruments that pay monthly interest and principal, however the behavior of the two
types vary according to the structure of the mortgage pool or CMO instrument. Management desires to maintain some amount of MBS and CMOs
in order to assist in adding to and maintaining a stable five-year ladder of cash flows, which is important in providing stable liquidity
and interest rate risk positions. U.S. agency MBS and CMO securities pay contractual monthly principal and interest, but are also subject
to additional prepayment of principal. The combined effect of all of these instruments paying monthly principal and interest provides
the Corporation with a reasonably stable base cash flow. Cash flows coming off of MBS and
CMOs do slow down and speed up as interest rates increase or decrease, which has an impact on the portfolio s length and yield. 

The portfolio of non-agency MBS and CMO securities stood at 89.7 million
as of September 30, 2024, or 17.3 of the total portfolio. This sector better structures the portfolio to achieve higher yields and shortens
the duration while also protecting in a rates-up environment. The non-agency portfolio stood at 56.2 million at December 31, 2023. The
increase in balances is part of the above-mentioned investment strategy coupled with off balance sheet interest rate swaps to protect
the Corporation s risk in a rates-up environment while taking advantage of the yield curve to earn more interest income. 

The Corporation s asset-backed securities declined by 6.3 million,
or 9.7 , from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024. Many of the bonds in this sector receive regular monthly principal payments which
caused the value to decline. These bonds are primarily floating rate instruments, so in the current higher rate environment, they have
added to the overall yield increase for the portfolio. 

39 

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Corporation s
corporate bonds decreased by 1.7 million, or 3.0 , from balances at December 31, 2023. Like any security, corporate bonds have both positive
and negative qualities and management must evaluate these securities on a risk versus reward basis. Corporate bonds add diversity to the
portfolio and provide strong yields for short maturities; however, by their very nature, corporate bonds carry a high level of credit
risk should the entity experience financial difficulties. As a result of the higher level of credit risk taken by purchasing a corporate
bond, management has in place procedures to closely analyze the financial health of the company. Financial analysis is conducted prior
to every corporate bond purchase with ongoing monitoring performed on all securities held. 

Obligations of states and political subdivisions, or municipal bonds,
consist of both tax-free and taxable securities. They carry the longest duration on average of any instrument in the securities portfolio.
Municipal tax-equivalent yields generally start above other taxable bonds. These instruments also experience significant fair market value
gains and losses when interest rates decrease and increase. Municipal securities were purchased throughout 2020 and 2021 due to the levels
of excess liquidity experienced due to deposit inflows. The balance of municipal bonds decreased by 3.8 million, or 2.0 , in the first
nine months of 2024, primarily due to the sale of a number of these bonds during the first quarter. Municipal bonds represented 35.4 
of the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and 40.8 as of December 31, 2023. 

Loans 

Net loans outstanding increased by 5.8 , to 1,395.8 million at September
30, 2024, from 1,319.2 million at September 30, 2023. Net loans increased by 3.8 , an annualized rate of 5.0 , from 1,344.9 million
at December 31, 2023. The following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

or 8.9 , the non-owner occupied CRE segment decreased 111,000, or 0.1 , and the residential real estate segment increased 23,336,000,
or 4.7 from balances at December 31, 2023. The agriculture segment is concentrated primarily in loans to dairy operators, poultry operators,
and crop farmers. Business loans are fairly diverse with small concentrations in lessors of residential buildings and dwellings
and lessors of non-residential buildings. These concentrations are less than 10 of the total business loan portfolio.

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

In the first nine months of 2024, mortgage production decreased 14 
compared to the first nine months of 2023. Purchase money origination constituted 93 of the Corporation s mortgage originations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with construction-only and construction-permanent loans making up 55 of that mix. 
As long term mortgage rates continue to slowly decline, the held-for-investment portfolio has decreased to 45 of total originations. 
As of September 30, 2024, adjustable-rate mortgage balances were 323.4 million, representing 62.1 of the 1-4 family residential loan
portfolio of the Corporation.

The total balance of non-performing assets increased by
 6,333,000, or 179.5 , over balances at September 30, 2023, and 6,586,000, or 201.0 , over balances at December 31, 2023. The
increase for both periods was due to the addition of a number of relationships experiencing payment defaults. Non-accrual loans
increased by 7,046,000, or 250.2 , since September 30, 2023, and 7,104,000, or 257.6 , since December 31, 2023. No loans were past due 90 days or more at September 30, 2024, compared to 713,000 at September 30,
2023, and 519,000 at December 31, 2023. The primary reason for the increase in non-accrual loans was the addition of a commercial
loan relationship with balances of 4.1 million, a residential mortgage loan in the amount of 1.1 million, another residential
mortgage loan in the amount of 813,000, an agriculture mortgage in the amount of 664,000, and a number of other much smaller loan
relationships. The Corporation has taken a more disciplined approach to classifying loans as non-accrual when they hit 90 days past
due which is why there are no loans at September 30, 2024, that are 90 days or more past due. While non-performing asset balances
have increased in the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation s total level of non-performing assets is in line with its
peer group. 

There was no other real estate owned (OREO) as of September 30, 2024,
December 31, 2023, or September 30, 2023. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a valuation
account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on total loans. Management
reviews the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. The ACL represents management s estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent
in loans as of the balance sheet date. The ACL is estimated by management using relevant available information, from both internal and
external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Corporation measures expected
credit losses for loans on a pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Additionally, the ACL calculation includes subjective
adjustments for qualitative risk factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical experience. These
qualitative adjustments may increase or reduce reserve levels and include adjustments for lending policies and procedures, loan portfolio
trends, lending management experience, asset quality, loan review, underlying collateral, credit concentrations, and external factors.
Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When management determines that foreclosure is probable
and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of collateral at the reporting
date adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. Based on the quarterly calculation, management will adjust the ACL through the provision
for credit losses as necessary.

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Strong credit and collateral policies have been instrumental in producing
a favorable history of credit losses for the Corporation. The Net Charge-Off table below shows the net charge-offs for each segment of
the Corporation s loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

The Corporation has historically experienced very low net charge-off
percentages due to conservative credit practices. As of September 30, 2024, there were 55,000 in charge-offs and 21,000 of recoveries,
representing a net charge-off position of 34,000 as shown above. As of September 30, 2023, there were 41,000 in charge-offs and 90,000
in recoveries, representing a net recovery position of 49,000. 

Management regularly reviews the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio
and the impact that current economic trends have on the Corporation s loans. The financial industry typically evaluates the quality
of loans on a scale with unclassified representing healthy loans, special mention being the first indication
of credit concern, and several successive classified ratings indicating further credit declines of substandard, doubtful, 
and, ultimately, loss. 

The Corporation s level of classified loans was 21.1
million on September 30, 2024, compared to 12.9 million on September 30, 2023. Total classified loans have increased from the prior
year due to the downgrading of a number of unrelated agriculture and business relationships. Despite the increase in total classified loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation s prudent credit
underwriting process has resulted in very few historical losses associated with classified loans. As certain loan relationships began
experiencing deterioration during 2024, the Corporation determined it was appropriate to evaluate these loans individually for specific
reserves. There was a higher
balance of loans individually evaluated for impairment as of September 30, 2004, but only a 460,000 specific allocation due to
these strong credit practices and the quality of loan collateral. 

Deposits 

The Corporation s total ending deposits at September 30, 2024,
increased by 88.6 million, or 5.1 , from December 31, 2023, and 154.4 million, or 9.3 , from September 30, 2023. Customer deposits are
the Corporation s primary source of funding for loans and securities. The mix of the Corporation s deposit categories has
changed marginally since September 30, 2023, as customers have moved from non-interest bearing and low-interest bearing accounts into
higher yielding checking accounts and time deposits. Since September 30, 2023, there has been a 15.9 million, or 2.7 increase in non-interest
bearing demand deposit accounts, a 27.0 million, or 8.0 increase in interest bearing demand balances, a 1.1 million, or 0.7 decrease
in money market account balances, a 47.8 million, or 14.8 decrease in savings account balances, and a 160.6 million, or 61.6 increase
in time deposit balances. 

42 

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

The increase in time deposit balances was partially the result of
issuing brokered certificates of deposit in order to fund a leverage strategy coupled with available-for-sale investment securities
purchases and interest rate swaps. Brokered CDs grew 58.1 million from 39.1 million at September 30, 2023 to 97.2 million as of
September 30, 2024. The remaining increase in time deposit balances was a result of the increased rate environment and offering
several promotional rates on specific time deposit terms throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. Time deposits are
typically a more rate-sensitive product, making them a source of funding that is prone to balance variations depending on the
interest rate environment and how the Corporation s time deposit rates compare with the local market rates. Time deposits
fluctuate as consumers search for the best rates in the market, with less allegiance to any particular financial institution. 

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the total uninsured deposits of
the Corporation were approximately 204,998,000 and 204,614,000, respectively or 11.3 and 12.3 , of total deposits. Total uninsured
deposits is calculated based on regulatory reporting requirements and reflects the portion of any deposit of a customer at an insured
depository institution that exceeds the applicable FDIC insurance coverage for that depositor at that institution and amounts in any other
uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regime. 

The Deposits by Major Classification table, shown below, provides the
balances of each category for September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023.

Level of fees on deposit products 

Borrowings 

Total borrowings were 127.5 million, 140.8 million, and 138.0 million
as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. There were no short-term borrowings as of September
30, 2024, December 31, 2023, or September 30, 2023. Short-term funds are used for immediate liquidity needs and are not typically part
of an ongoing liquidity or interest rate risk strategy; therefore, they fluctuate more rapidly. When short-term funds are used, they are
purchased through correspondent and member bank relationships as overnight borrowings or through the FHLB for terms less than one year. 

43 

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Total long-term borrowings, borrowings initiated for terms longer than
one year, were 87.8 million as of September 30, 2024, 101.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and 98.5 million as of September 30, 2023,
respectively. The long-term borrowings for the Corporation were made up entirely of FHLB long-term advances. FHLB advances are used as
a secondary source of funding and to mitigate interest rate risk. These long-term funding instruments are typically a more effective funding
instrument in terms of selecting the exact amount, rate, and term of funding rather than trying to source the same through deposits. In
this manner, management can efficiently meet known liquidity and interest rate risk needs. The Corporation continues to be well under
the FHLB maximum borrowing capacity (MBC), which is currently 714.0 million. The Corporation s internal policy limits are far more
restrictive than the FHLB MBC, which is calculated and set quarterly by FHLB. 

In addition to the long-term advances funded through the FHLB, o n
December 30, 2020, the Corporation completed the sale of a subordinated debt note offering. The Corporation sold 20.0 million of subordinated
debt notes with a maturity date of December 30, 2030. These notes are non-callable for 5 years and carry a fixed interest rate of 4 per
year for 5 years and then convert to a floating rate for the remainder of the term. The notes can be redeemed at par beginning 5 years
prior to maturity. The notes are structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for the Corporation and any funds it invests in the Bank qualify
as Tier 1 capital at the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, 16.0 million of funds were invested in the Bank. The Corporation paid an issuance
fee of 2 of the total issue that will be amortized to the call date on a pro-rata basis. 

On July 22, 2022, the Corporation completed the sale of an additional
subordinated debt note offering. The Corporation sold 20.0 million of subordinated debt notes with a maturity date of September
30, 2032. These notes are all non-callable for 5 years and carry a fixed interest rate of 5.75 per year for the 5 years and then
convert to a floating rate for the remainder of the term. The notes can be redeemed at par beginning 5 years prior to maturity. 
The notes are structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for the Corporation and any funds it invests in the Bank qualify as Tier 1 capital
at the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, 17.0 million of funds were invested in the Bank. The Corporation paid an issuance fee of
2 of the total issue that will be amortized to the call date on a pro-rata basis. 

Stockholders Equity 

Federal regulatory authorities require banks to meet minimum capital
levels. The Corporation, as well as the Bank, as the solely owned subsidiary of the Corporation, maintains capital ratios well above those
minimum levels. The risk-weighted capital ratios are calculated by dividing capital by total risk-weighted assets. Regulatory guidelines
determine the risk-weighted assets by assigning assets to specific risk-weighted categories. The calculation of tier I capital to risk-weighted
average assets does not include an add-back to capital for the amount of the allowance for credit losses, thereby making this ratio lower
than the total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio. 

The consolidated asset limit on small bank holding companies is 3
billion and a company with assets under that limit is not subject to the consolidated capital rules but may disclose capital amounts and
ratios. The Corporation has elected to disclose those amounts and ratios.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, the Corporation typically has off-balance
sheet arrangements related to loan funding commitments. These arrangements may impact the Corporation s financial condition and
liquidity if they were to be exercised within a short period of time. As discussed in the following liquidity section, the Corporation
has in place sufficient liquidity alternatives to meet these obligations. The following table presents information on the commitments

Market Risks 

Bank failures and bank uncertainties have created in the past and may continue in the future to create market and other risks, for all
financial institutions and banks, including the Corporation. These risks include, but are not limited to: 

1. Market risk and loss of confidence in the financial services sector, and/or specific banks; 

2. Deterioration of securities and loan portfolios; 

3. Deposit reductions with higher volumes and occurring over shorter periods of time; 

4. Increased liquidity demand and utilization of sources of liquidity; and 

5. Interest rate volatility and abrupt, sudden and greater than usual rate changes. 

These factors individually, or in any combination, could materially
and adversely affect: 

1. Financial condition; 

2. Operations and results thereof; and 

3. Stock price. 

In addition, bank failures and uncertainties may result in an
increase of FDIC deposit insurance premiums and/or result in special FDIC deposit insurance assessments, which also may adversely
affect the Corporation s financial condition, operations, results thereof or stock price. 

The Corporation cannot predict the impact, timing or duration of such
events. 

Significant Legislation 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law. Dodd-Frank is intended to affect a fundamental restructuring of federal banking regulation. Among
other things, Dodd-Frank creates a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify systemic risks in the financial system and gives
federal regulators new authority to take control of and liquidate financial firms. Dodd-Frank additionally creates a new independent federal
regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws. Among the provisions that have already or are likely to affect the Corporation
are the following: 

46 

ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Holding Company Capital Requirements 

Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to apply consolidated capital
requirements to bank holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. Under these
standards, trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier I capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010,
by a bank holding company with less than 15 billion in assets. Dodd-Frank additionally requires that bank regulators issue countercyclical
capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic
contraction, are consistent with safety and soundness. 

Deposit Insurance 

Dodd-Frank permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount
for banks, savings institutions, and credit unions to 250,000 per depositor. Additionally, on February 7, 2011, the Board of Directors
of the FDIC approved a final rule based on the Dodd-Frank Act that revises the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to
one based on assets. This change, which was effective in April 2011, saved the Corporation a significant amount of FDIC insurance premiums
from the significantly higher FDIC insurance premiums placed into effect after the financial crisis. 

Corporate Governance 

Dodd-Frank requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders
a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years, a non-binding vote regarding the frequency of the vote on executive
compensation at least every six years, and a non-binding vote on golden parachute payments in connection with approvals
of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by shareholders. The SEC has finalized the rules implementing these requirements
which took effect on January 21, 2011. The Corporation was exempt from these requirements until January 21, 2013, due to its status as
a smaller reporting company. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),
which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection
Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and
primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions will be
subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance
purposes. The CFPB will have authority to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer
financial products. Dodd-Frank authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages
including a determination of the borrower s ability to repay. In addition, Dodd-Frank will allow borrowers to raise certain defenses
to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the CFPB. Dodd-Frank permits states
to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances,
permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 

Interstate Branching 

Dodd-Frank authorizes national and state banks to establish branches
in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted. Previously, banks could only establish branches
in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks will
be able to enter new markets more freely. 

Limits on Interstate Acquisitions and Mergers 

Dodd-Frank precludes a bank holding company from engaging in an interstate
acquisition the acquisition of a bank outside its home state unless the bank holding company is both well capitalized
and well managed. Furthermore, a bank may not engage in an interstate merger with another bank headquartered in another state unless the
surviving institution will be well capitalized and well managed. The previous standard in both cases was adequately capitalized and adequately
managed. 

47 

ENB FINANCIAL CORP 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As a financial institution, the Corporation is subject to three primary
risks: 

Credit risk 

Liquidity risk 

Interest rate risk 

The Board of Directors has established an Asset Liability Management
Committee (ALCO) to measure, monitor, and manage these primary market risks. The Asset Liability Policy has instituted guidelines for
all of these primary risks, as well as other financial performance measurements with target ranges. The Asset Liability goals and guidelines
are consistent with the Strategic Plan goals related to financial performance. 

Credit Risk 

For discussion on credit risk refer to the sections in Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis, on securities, non-performing assets, and allowance for credit losses. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity refers to having an adequate supply of cash available to
meet business needs. Financial institutions must ensure that there is adequate liquidity to meet a variety of funding needs, at a minimal
cost. Funding new loans and covering deposit withdrawals are the primary liquidity needs of the Corporation. The Corporation uses a variety
of funding sources to meet liquidity needs, such as deposits, loan repayments, cash flows from securities, borrowings, and current earnings. 

As noted in the discussion on deposits, customers have historically
provided the Corporation with a reliable and steadily increasing source of funds liquidity. The Corporation also has in place relationships
with other banking institutions for the purpose of buying and selling Federal funds. The lines of credit with these institutions provide
immediate sources of additional liquidity. The Corporation currently has unsecured lines of credit totaling 30 million. This does not
include amounts available from member banks such as the Federal Reserve Discount Window or the FHLB of Pittsburgh. 

The Corporation regularly
reviews its liquidity position by measuring its projected net cash flows at a 30 and 90-day interval. The Corporation stresses the measurements
by assuming a level of deposit out-flows that have not historically been realized. In addition to this forecast, other funding sources
are reviewed as a method to provide emergency funding if necessary. The objective of this measurement is to identify the amount of cash
that could be raised quickly without the need to liquidate assets. The Corporation also stresses its liquidity position utilizing different
longer-term scenarios. The varying degrees of stress create pressure on deposit flows in its local market, reduce access to wholesale
funding and limit access of funds available through brokered deposit channels. In addition to stressing cash flow, specific liquidity
risk indicators are monitored to help identify risk areas. This analysis helps identify and quantify the potential cash surplus/deficit
over a variety of time horizons to ensure the Corporation has adequate funding resources. Assumptions used for liquidity stress testing
are subjective. Should an evolving liquidity situation or business cycle present new data, potential assumption changes will be considered.
The Corporation believes it can meet all anticipated liquidity demands. 

Historically, the Corporation
has satisfied its liquidity needs from earnings, repayment of loans and amortizing investment securities, maturing investment securities,
loan sales, deposit growth and its ability to access existing lines of credit. All investment securities are classified as available for
sale; therefore, securities that are unencumbered can be used as collateral for borrowings and are an additional source of readily available
liquidity. 

48 

ENB FINANCIAL CORP 

The Corporation analyzes the following additional liquidity measurements
in an effort to monitor and mitigate liquidity risk: 

On-hand Liquidity/Total Liabilities Net liquid assets as a percentage of total liabilities 

Non-Core Funding Dependence Non-core liabilities minus short-term investments as a percentage of long-term assets 

Reliance on Wholesale Funding Wholesale funding as a percentage of total funding 

Net Short-term Liabilities/Total Assets Short-term liabilities minus short-term assets as a percentage of total assets 

Loan to Deposit Ratio Total loans as a percentage of total deposits 

Investment Securities to Assets Threshold Total investment securities as a percentage of total assets 

These measurements are designed to prevent undue reliance on outside
sources of funding and to ensure a steady stream of liquidity is available should events occur that would cause a sudden decrease in deposits
or large increase in loans or both, which would in turn draw significantly from the Corporation s available liquidity sources. As
of September 30, 2024, the Corporation was within guidelines for all of the above measurements. 

The Corporation s liquidity measurements are tracked and reported
quarterly by management to both observe trends and ensure the measurements stay within desired ranges. Management is confident that a
sufficient amount of internal and external liquidity exists to provide for significant unanticipated liquidity needs. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk is measured using two analytical tools: 

Changes in net interest income 

Changes in net portfolio value 

Financial modeling is used to forecast net interest
income and earnings, as well as net portfolio value, also referred to as fair value. The modeling is generally conducted under seven different
interest rate scenarios that can vary according to the present level of interest rates. The scenarios consist of a projection of net interest
income if rates remain flat, increase 100, 200, or 300 basis points, or decrease 100, 200, or 300 basis points. 

The results obtained through the use of forecasting
models are based on a variety of factors. Both the net interest income and fair value forecasts make use of the maturity and repricing
schedules to determine the changes to the balance sheet over the course of time. Additionally, there are many assumptions that factor
into the results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Projected forward interest rates 

Slope of the U.S. Treasury curve 

Spreads available on securities over the U.S. Treasury curve 

Prepayment speeds on loans held and mortgage-backed securities 

Anticipated calls on securities with call options 

Deposit and loan balance fluctuations 

Competitive pressures affecting loan and deposit rates 

Economic conditions 

Consumer reaction to interest rate changes 

As a result of the many assumptions, this information
should not be relied upon to predict future results. Additionally, both of the analyses discussed below do not consider any action that
management could take to minimize or offset the negative effect of changes in interest rates. These tools are used to assist management
in identifying possible areas of risk in order to address them before a greater risk is posed. Back testing of the model is completed
to compare actual results to projections to ensure the validity of the assumptions in the model. The back testing analyses indicate that
the model assumptions are reliable.

ENB FINANCIAL CORP 

Changes in Net Interest Income 

The change in net interest income measures the amount
of net interest income fluctuation that would be experienced over one year, assuming interest rates change immediately and remain the
same for one year. This is considered to be a short-term view of interest rate risk. The analysis of changes in net interest income due
to changes in interest rates is commonly referred to as interest rate sensitivity. The Corporation s interest rate sensitivity analysis
indicates that if interest rates were to change immediately, the Corporation would realize less net interest income in all up and down
rate scenarios. In past years, the Corporation was generally showing asset sensitivity meaning in a rates-up environment, assets would
reprice faster than liabilities resulting in higher net interest income. In the past year, this increase in net interest income shifted
to a decline primarily due to the increased impact from a higher cost of funds if rates continue to rise. While the Corporation would
recognize higher interest income on its variable-rate assets, it would also now be repricing liabilities at a much faster pace resulting
in increased interest expense that would offset the rise in interest income. Likewise, in the down-rate scenarios, asset yields would
decline in conjunction with market rate moves, while deposit repricing would be slower to retain existing deposit balances. 

The third quarter of 2024 analysis projects net interest
income expected in the seven rate scenarios over a one-year time horizon. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation was within guidelines
for the maximum amount of net interest income change in all rate scenarios. 

The assumptions and analysis of interest rate risk
are based on historical experience during varied economic cycles. Management believes these assumptions to be appropriate; however, actual
results could vary significantly. Management uses this analysis to identify trends in interest rate sensitivity and determine if action
is necessary to mitigate asset liability risk. 

Changes in Net Portfolio Value 

The change in net portfolio value is considered a
tool to measure long-term interest rate risk. The analysis measures the exposure of the balance sheet to valuation changes due to changes
in interest rates. The calculation of net portfolio value discounts future cash flows to the present value based on current market rates.
The change in net portfolio value estimates the gain or loss in value that would occur on market sensitive instruments given an interest
rate increase or decrease in the same seven scenarios mentioned above. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation was within guidelines
for all rate scenarios except the down-300 basis point scenario. The Corporation shows a favorable benefit to net portfolio value in the
rising rate scenarios, due primarily to the large amount of core deposits on the Corporation s balance sheet. The non-interest bearing
demand deposit accounts and low-interest bearing checking, and money market accounts provide more benefit to the Corporation when
interest rates are higher and the difference between the overnight funding costs compared to the average interest bearing core deposit
rates are greater. As interest rates increase, the discount rate used to value the Corporation s interest bearing accounts increases,
causing a lower net present value for these interest-bearing deposits. This improves the modeling of the Corporation s fair value
risk to higher interest rates as the liability amounts decrease causing a higher net portfolio value of the Corporation s balance
sheet. However, as interest rates decrease, the discount rate used to value the Corporation s interest bearing accounts decreases,
causing a higher net present value for these interest-bearing deposits. 

The analysis shows a valuation loss in the down rate
scenarios. Policy allows for a valuation decline of 30 for the down-300 basis point scenario and actual projected results show a valuation
decline of 42 . While this loss is outside of policy guidelines, it is unlikely that rates would move down immediately by 300 basis points.
The Corporation will continue to monitor these measurements in the down-rate scenarios and adjust balance sheet structure as necessary
to prepare for future potential lower rates. 

The weakness with the net portfolio value analysis
is that it assumes liquidation of the Corporation rather than as a going concern. For that reason, it is considered a secondary measurement
of interest rate risk to Changes in Net Interest Income discussed above. However, the net portfolio value analysis is a
more important tool to measure the impact of interest rate changes to capital. In the current regulatory climate, the focus is on ensuring
adequate asset liability modeling is being done to project the impact of very large interest rate increases on capital. The asset liability
modeling currently in place measures the impact of such a rate change on the valuation of the Corporation s loans, securities, deposits,
and borrowings, and the resulting impact to capital. Management continues to analyze additional scenario testing to model worst
case scenarios to adequately plan for the possible severe impact of such events.
