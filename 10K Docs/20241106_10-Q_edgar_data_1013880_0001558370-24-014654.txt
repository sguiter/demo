 million at December 1, 2023, including approximately million of goodwill. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company concluded there were no triggering events and completed its qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, which included, among other things, an assessment of changes in macroeconomic conditions, comparison of the actual results to those forecasted in the most recent annual impairment test and performing sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company identified a triggering event for impairment primarily attributable to the impact of a sustained decline in its market capitalization that was less than the combined carrying value of the Company s reporting units. As such, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using an equal weighting of the income and market valuation approaches. The income approach applied a fair value methodology to each reporting unit based on discounted cash flows. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internally developed forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the Company s business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of the Company s weighted average cost of capital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit. The weighted average cost of capital used in the Company s most recent impairment test ranged from to . The Company also applied a market approach, which develops a value correlation based on the market capitalization of similar publicly traded companies, referred to as a multiple, to apply to the operating results of the reporting units. The primary market multiples to which the Company compared are revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The resulting fair value of the TTEC Engage reporting unit decreased below its carrying value, which resulted in recording a million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge. Recognition of this non-cash goodwill impairment charge resulted in a tax benefit that generated an incremental deferred tax asset of million to the reporting unit s carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recorded an additional non-cash charge of million to reduce the Company s carrying value to its previously determined fair value in accordance with the applicable goodwill impairment guidance. In total, a non-cash impairment loss of million was recognized for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed its qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, which included, among other things, an assessment of changes in macro-economic conditions, comparison of the actual results to those forecasted in the most recent second quarter of 2024 quantitative impairment test and performing sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. The Company assessed whether any such indicators of impairment existed and concluded there were no triggering events. However, if projected operating results are not met and/or the Company s market capitalization declines, the Company s reporting units could be at risk for future impairment.

 Financial Highlights In the third quarter of 2024, our revenue decreased 73.5 million, or 12.2 , to 529.4 million over the same period in 2023 including a decrease of 0.5 million, or 0.1 , due to foreign currency fluctuations. The decrease in revenue was comprised of a 17.6 million, or 13.2 , decrease for TTEC Digital and a decrease of 55.9 million, or 11.9 , for TTEC Engage. Our third quarter 2024 income from operations decreased 12.5 million, or 49.2 , to 12.9 million or 2.4 of revenue, compared to 25.4 million or 4.2 of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in operating income is due to several factors across both segments. The TTEC Digital operating income decreased 37.3 over the same period last year primarily due to lower revenue from one-time on-premise related revenue and additional investment in talent as we continue to diversify our offerings. The TTEC Engage operating income decreased 59.8 over the same period last year due to lower revenue, ongoing start-up costs for a large public sector contract launched earlier in the year and investment in talent as part of this transition year, partially offset by improved operational performance. Income (loss) from operations in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 included 5.7 million and 5.5 million of restructuring charges and asset impairments, respectively. Our offshore customer experience centers spanning 13 countries serve clients based in the U.S. and in other countries with 23,400 workstations, representing 78 of our global delivery capability. Revenue for our TTEC Engage segment provided in these offshore locations represented 35 of our revenue for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 32 of our revenue for the corresponding period in 2023. Our seat utilization is defined as the total number of utilized workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations. As of September 30, 2024, the total production workstations for our TTEC Engage segment was 30,200, a net decrease of 1,400 workstations over the same period last year, with an overall capacity utilization 70 in line with the prior year period. We plan to continue to selectively retain and grow capacity and expand into new offshore markets, while maintaining appropriate capacity onshore. As we grow our offshore delivery capabilities and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation increases, we will continue to actively manage this risk via a multi-currency hedging program. Recent Developments As previously disclosed, the Company s Board of Directors has established a special committee consisting of independent directors (the Special Committee to evaluate the unsolicited, preliminary, non-binding proposal letter, dated September 27, 2024, from TTEC founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Tuchman, to take the Company private at a proposed purchase price of 6.85 per share to the Company s other shareholders.

TTEC Digital Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Revenue 115,669 133,252 (17,583) (13.2) Operating Income 7,474 11,925 (4,451) (37.3) Operating Margin 6.5 8.9 The decrease in revenue for the TTEC Digital segment was driven by the non-recurring and large one-time on-premise related revenue in the prior year. The remaining TTEC Digital portfolio was up 5.9 year over year mostly due to an increase in recurring revenue. The operating income decrease was primarily related to lower revenue and investment in talent to support the expansion of our new and existing offerings. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to 6.5 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 8.9 in the prior period. Included in operating income was amortization expense related to acquired intangibles of 4.1 million and 4.3 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. TTEC Engage Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Revenue 413,758 469,704 (55,946) (11.9) Operating Income (loss) 5,415 13,463 (8,048) (59.8) Operating Margin 1.3 2.9 The decrease in revenue for the TTEC Engage segment is explained by a long tenured client exiting a large line of business supported by TTEC, lower demand from select large onshore enterprise clients due to clients continued conservative cost management by moderating the level of customer support to address cost pressures. The operating income (loss) change was primarily attributable to lower revenue, launch of a new large public contract and investment in talent, partially offset by operational performance improvement. As a result, operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue decreased to 1.3 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2.9 in the prior period. Included in operating income was amortization expense related to acquired intangibles of 4.1 million and 4.6 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Interest Income (Expense) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 interest income decreased to 0.3 million from 1.3 million in the same period in 2023 due to a lower balance of international cash resulting from repatriated cash during 2024. Interest expense increased to 21.7 million during 2024 from 20.3 million during 2023 due to higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 Other income (expense), net decreased to expense of 1.0 million from income of 0.7 million during the prior year quarter. Included in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a 0.5 million gain related to the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration for the Faneuil acquisition (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Included in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was a 0.1 million expense related to the fair value adjustments of contingent consideration for the Faneuil acquisition. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (98.1) . This compares to an effective tax rate of 74.7 for the comparable period of 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by the distribution of income between the U.S. and international tax jurisdictions, earnings in international jurisdictions currently under an income tax holiday, and the impact of valuation allowances in the United States and several other jurisdictions. After Non-GAAP adjustments, the Company s normalized tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 58.5 . Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 The tables included in the following sections are presented to facilitate an understanding of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and present certain information by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Revenue 344,068 367,764 (23,696) (6.4) Operating Income 16,771 19,864 (3,093) (15.6) Operating Margin 4.9 5.4 The decrease in revenue for the TTEC Digital segment was driven by lower one-time on-premise related revenue and professional services revenue. It was partially offset by an increase of 8.7 in recurring revenue. The operating income decrease is primarily attributable to the lower revenue and investment in talent to support the diversification of our offerings. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to 4.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.4 in the prior period. Included in operating income was amortization expense related to acquired intangibles of 12.7 million and 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 
 The decrease in revenue for the TTEC Engage segment is explained by a long tenured client exiting a large line of business supported by TTEC, lower demand from select large onshore enterprise clients due to clients continued conservative management of discretionary spending influenced by a challenging macro-economic environment and delays attributable to launching new and larger awarded contracts. The operating income (loss) change was primarily attributable to a goodwill impairment charge, higher restructuring charges and lower revenue. As a result, operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue decreased to (15.9) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.5 in the prior period. Included in operating income was amortization expense related to acquired intangibles of 12.3 million and 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest Income (Expense) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 interest income decreased to 1.7 million from 3.6 million in the same period in 2023 due to a lower balance of international cash resulting from repatriated cash during 2024. Interest expense increased to 63.2 million during 2024 from 56.7 million during 2023 due to higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Other income (expense), net increased to net income of 1.0 million from net expense of 2.2 million during the prior year period. Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a 1.5 million gain related to the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration for the Faneuil acquisition. Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a gain of 4.5 million due to insurance recovery related to property damages and a net 6.9 million expense related to the fair value adjustments of contingent consideration accruals and receivables for one acquisition. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (26.4) . This compared to an effective tax rate of 42.2 for the comparable period of 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by the distribution of income between the U.S. and international tax jurisdictions, earnings in international jurisdictions currently under an income tax holiday, an impairment charge, and the impact of valuation allowances in the United States and several other jurisdictions. After Non-GAAP adjustments, the Company s normalized tax rate for 2024 was 41.0 . Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations, our cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our Credit Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated operating cash flows of (57.7) million. We believe that our cash generated from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and available credit will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. However, if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. We manage a centralized global treasury function in the United States with a focus on safeguarding and optimizing the use of our global cash and cash equivalents. Our cash is held in the U.S. in U.S. dollars, and outside of the U.S. in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies. We expect to use our cash to fund working capital, global operations, dividends, acquisitions, and other strategic activities. While there are no assurances, we believe our global cash is well protected given our cash management practices, banking partners and utilization of diversified bank deposit accounts and other high-quality investments. We have global operations that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may positively or negatively impact our liquidity. To mitigate these risks, we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts through our cash flow hedging program. Please refer to Part I. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Foreign Currency Risk, for further discussion. We are also exposed to higher interest rates associated with our variable rate debt.

Table of Contents 
 The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all liquid investments purchased within three months of their original maturity to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 96.9 million and 172.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decline from prior year is explained by the change in our APB 23 policy that allowed the Company to repatriate international cash and reduce the credit line. We diversify the holdings of such cash and cash equivalents considering the financial condition and stability of the counterparty institutions. We reinvest our cash flows to grow our client base, expand our infrastructure, invest in research and development, for strategic acquisitions and to pay dividends. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows (used in)/provided by operating activities was (57.7) million and 113.2 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to a 67.9 million decrease in net cash income from operations and a 103.0 million decrease in net working capital. The termination of the AR factoring arrangement, effective in the third quarter of 2024, had a significant impact to our working capital conversion in the quarter. The termination of the AR credit facility negatively impacted our cash flows by (81.8) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and (101.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities was 36.3 million and 54.5 million, respectively. The decrease was due to a 18.3 million decrease in capital expenditures as we had less need for computers and completed our site expansion in new geographies. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows provided by/(used in) financing activities was 14.8 million and (71.5) million, respectively. The change in net cash flows from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to a 26.0 million net change in the line of credit, 37.7 million related to payments of contingent consideration and 21.7 million of incremental dividends paid during 2023. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow (see Presentation of Non-GAAP Measurements below for the definition of free cash flow) decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in net cash from operations and a decrease in working capital. Free cash flow was (94.2) million and 58.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The normalized free cash flow would have been (18.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 based on the reasons mentioned above. Presentation of Non-GAAP Measurements Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measurement. We believe that free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow is not a measure determined by GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for income from operations, net income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful, in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities, because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures, since it includes cash required for debt service. Free cash flow also includes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions, investments and other needs that may arise.

 The following table reconciles net cash (used in) provided by operating activities to free cash flow for our consolidated results (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (91,377) (31,718) (57,732) 113,231 Less: Purchases of property, plant and equipment 8,783 21,768 36,465 54,722 Free cash flow (100,160) (53,486) (94,197) 58,509 Obligations and Future Capital Requirements There were no material changes to the Company s contractual obligations and future capital requirements outside the normal course of business from the date of our 2023 Form 10-K filing on February 29, 2024 through the filing of this report. Future Capital Requirements We expect total capital expenditures in 2024 to be between 2.1 and 2.3 of revenue. Approximately 80 of these expected capital expenditures are to support growth in our business and 20 relate to the maintenance for existing assets. The anticipated level of 2024 capital expenditures is primarily driven by site expansions, new builds in emerging geographies, and ongoing digital integration and product development. The amount of capital required over the next 12 months will depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain, upgrade or replace existing assets. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could also increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital upon commercially reasonable terms acceptable to us. Client Concentration During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one of our clients represented more than 10 of our total revenue. Our five largest clients, collectively, accounted for 31.5 and 34.5 of our consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 32.6 and 35.1 of our consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have had long-term relationships with our top five TTEC Engage clients, ranging from 5 to 25 years, with all of these clients having completed multiple contract renewals with us. The relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis and varies greatly based upon specific contract terms. In addition, clients may adjust business volumes served by us based on their business requirements. We believe the risk of this concentration is mitigated, in part, by the long-term contracts we have with our largest clients. Although certain client contracts may be terminated for convenience by either party, we believe this risk is mitigated, in part, by the service level disruptions and transition/migration costs that would arise for our clients if they terminated our contract for convenience. Some of the contracts with our five largest clients expire between 2025 and 2027, but many of our largest clients have multiple contracts with us with different expiration dates for different lines of work. We have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients, but there can be no assurance that future contracts will be renewed or, if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates. Market risk also includes credit and non-performance risk by counterparties to our various financial instruments. We are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates (as measured against the U.S. dollar); as well as credit risk associated with potential non-performance of our counterparty banks. These exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities. We enter into derivative instruments to manage and reduce the impact of currency exchange rate changes, primarily between the U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso, and the Australian dollar/Philippine peso. To mitigate against credit and non-performance risk, it is our policy to only enter into derivative contracts and other financial instruments with investment grade counterparty financial institutions and, correspondingly, our derivative valuations reflect the creditworthiness of our counterparties. As of the date of this report, we have not experienced, nor do we anticipate, any issues related to derivative counterparty defaults. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate on our Credit Agreement is variable based upon the Prime Rate and SOFR and, therefore, is affected by changes in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,025.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Based upon average outstanding borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest accrued at a rate of approximately 7.8 per annum. If the Prime Rate or SOFR increased by 100 basis points, there would be an annualized 1.0 million of additional interest expense per 100.0 million of outstanding borrowing under the Credit Agreement. Foreign Currency Risk Our subsidiaries in the Philippines, Mexico, India, Bulgaria, Colombia, South Africa, Egypt, Honduras and Poland use the local currency as their functional currency for paying labor and other operating costs. Conversely, revenue for these foreign subsidiaries is derived principally from client contracts that are invoiced and collected in U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. As a result, we may experience foreign currency gains or losses, which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue associated with this foreign exchange risk was 21 and 19 of our consolidated revenue, respectively. In order to mitigate the risk of these non-functional foreign currencies weakening against the functional currencies of the servicing subsidiaries, which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries, we may hedge a portion, though not 100 , of the projected foreign currency exposure related to client programs served from these foreign countries through our cash flow hedging program. While our hedging strategy can protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term, an overall weakening of the non-functional foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the segments of the servicing subsidiary over the long term. Cash Flow Hedging Program To reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with forecasted revenue in non-functional currencies, we purchase forward and/or option contracts to acquire the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary at a fixed exchange rate at specific dates in the future. We have designated and account for these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue in non-functional currencies. While we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we cannot ensure that we will not recognize gains or losses from international transactions, as this is part of transacting business in an international environment. Not every exposure is or can be hedged and, where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign exchange exposure, they are based on forecasts for which actual results may differ from the original estimate. Failure to successfully hedge or anticipate currency risks properly could adversely affect our consolidated operating results.

 Our cash flow hedging instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (in thousands). All hedging instruments are forward contracts, except as noted.

The fair value of our cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2024 was assets/(liabilities) (in thousands): 

Maturing in the September 30, 2024 Next 12 Months Philippine Peso 2,100 1,441 Mexican Peso 276 608 2,376 2,049 Our cash flow hedges are valued using models based on market observable inputs, including both forward and spot foreign exchange rates, implied volatility, and counterparty credit risk. The decrease in fair value from December 31, 2023 reflects changes in the currency translation between the U.S. dollar and Mexican peso and U.S. dollar and Philippine pesos. We recorded net gains of 2.7 million and 2.7 million for settled cash flow hedge contracts and the related premiums for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These gains were reflected in Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). If the exchange rates between our various currency pairs were to increase or decrease by 10 from current period-end levels, we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts. However, any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding increases or decreases in our underlying exposures. Other than the transactions hedged as discussed above and in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of the transactions of our U.S. and foreign operations are denominated in their respective local currency. However, transactions are denominated in other currencies from time-to-time. We do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we endeavor to settle these accounts on a timely basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 15 and 14 , respectively, of revenue was derived from contracts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our results from operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. Fair Value of Debt and Equity Securities We did not have any investments in marketable debt or equity securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES This report includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer (the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (the CFO required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of internal control are met. Further, the design of internal controls must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Inherent limitations within internal controls include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by unauthorized override of controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. While the objective of the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of controls, such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and such assumptions, while reasonable, may not take into account all potential future conditions. Thus, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Therefore, because of the inherent limitations in cost effective internal controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Stock Repurchase Program We continue to have the opportunity to return capital to our shareholders via a stock repurchase program (originally authorized by the Board of Directors in 2001). As of December 31, 2023, the cumulative authorized repurchase allowance was 762.3 million, of which we have used 735.8 million to purchase 46.1 million shares. The Board most recently authorized additional funds under the repurchase program in 2017 and of the total amount authorized, approximately 26.6 million continues to be authorized for repurchase as of December 31, 2023. During 2023, and year to date in 2024, we did not purchase any shares under the program. Although the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date, we would seek a re-authorization of repurchases from the Board of Directors, if we decide to make repurchases during 2024.

Any judgment or order entered in such action or arbitration shall contain a specific provision providing for the recovery of attorneys and experts fees and costs incurred in enforcing such judgment. All fees and costs to be paid under this Section shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by a jury.

If Buyer defaults in any of its other representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement, and such default continues for more than ten (10) days after written notice from Seller, then Seller

may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to such default being cured by giving written notice thereof, and upon termination Buyer shall forfeit the Deposit and any Development Approvals Extension Deposits deposited with Escrow Holder, and the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit and any such Development Approvals Extension Deposits to Seller, and neither party shall be obligated to proceed with the purchase and sale of the Property. THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT SELLER S ACTUAL DAMAGES DUE TO A DEFAULT BY BUYER WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE. THEREFORE, BY PLACING THEIR INITIALS BELOW, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT AND ANY DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS EXTENSION DEPOSITS HAS BEEN AGREED UPON, AFTER NEGOTIATION, AS THE PARTIES REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLER S DAMAGES AND AS SELLER S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST BUYER ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO A BREACH BUYER OF ITS OBLIGATION TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO BUYER S INDEMNITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AND THAT PAYMENT OF SUCH AMOUNT TO SELLER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED AS A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY. 
 
 __________________ ___________________ Seller s Initials Buyer s Initials 10. Default by Seller . If the transaction is not consummated solely as a result of a default (including a breach of any representation or warranty) by Seller, then Buyer may as its exclusive remedy either (a) terminate this Agreement by delivery of notice of termination to Seller, whereupon Seller shall immediately return the Deposit and any Development Approvals Extension Deposit deposited with Escrow Holder to Buyer, Seller shall pay any title and/or escrow fees charged by the Escrow Holder in connection with canceling the Escrow, and Seller shall reimburse Buyer for its verifiable and documented out-of-pocket third-party costs actually incurred in connection with the transaction contemplated herein, not to exceed the amount of 150,000.00 in the aggregate; or (b) subject to the conditions below, seek specific performance of Seller s obligation to deliver the Deed pursuant to the Agreement (but not damages). Buyer may seek specific performance of Seller s obligation to deliver the Deed pursuant to this Agreement only if, as a condition precedent to initiating such litigation for specific performance, Buyer first shall (i) not otherwise be in default under this Agreement; and (ii) file suit therefor with the court on or before the 60th day after the Closing Date; if Buyer fails to file an action for specific performance within 60 days after the Closing Date, then Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate the Agreement in accordance with subsection (a) above. In the event Buyer elects to seek specific performance of Seller s obligation to deliver the Deed in accordance with subsection (b) above, but such remedy is unavailable because Seller has deeded the Property to a third party on or prior to the Closing Date, then Buyer shall be entitled to bring a claim against Seller for its verifiable and documented out-of-pocket third-party costs actually incurred by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and in the pursuit of such damages from Seller. 
 11. Risk of Loss; Condemnation. All risk of loss shall remain with Seller until Closing. Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement in the event of destruction or damage of all or any portion of the Real Property. In the event of the taking of all or any material 

 23 

portion of the Real Property by eminent domain proceedings, or the commencement of such proceedings prior to Closing, that Buyer reasonably determines in good faith will materially adversely affect development of the intended Project, Buyer shall have the right, at Buyer s option, to terminate this Agreement by delivering notice to Seller within ten (10) business days after Buyer s discovery of such condemnation action, in which case (and notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement), the Deposit and any Development Approvals Extension Deposit deposited with Escrow Holder shall be released to Seller and except as otherwise provided herein, the parties shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement. If Buyer does not so terminate this Agreement, or there is substantial destruction or damage to any portion of the Real Property that does not give rise to Buyer s right to terminate, then Buyer shall proceed to close with no reduction in the Purchase Price, in which event upon the Closing, there shall be a credit against the Purchase Price equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards collected by Seller as a result of any such damage or destruction or condemnation, plus the amount of any insurance deductible or co-insurance, less any sums reasonably expended by Seller toward the collection of such proceeds or awards and the restoration or repair of the Real Property (the nature of which restoration or repairs, but not the right of Seller to effect such restoration or repairs, shall be subject to the approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the proceeds or awards have not been collected as of the Closing, then such proceeds or awards shall be assigned to Buyer, except to the extent needed to reimburse Seller for sums reasonably expended to collect such proceeds or awards or to repair or restore the Real Property, and Seller shall retain the rights to such proceeds and awards to such extent. It is expressly agreed between the parties hereto that this Section shall in no way apply to customary dedications for public purposes which may be necessary for the development of the Property. 
 12. Delivery of Possession. Seller shall deliver possession of the Real Property to Buyer as required hereunder and shall deliver to Buyer or make available at the Real Property a set of keys to the Real Property on the Closing Date. 
 13. Brokers. The parties represent and warrant to each other that no broker or finder was instrumental in arranging or bringing about this transaction. If any person brings a claim for a commission or finder s fee based upon any contact, dealings or communication with Buyer or Seller, then the party through whom such person makes his claim shall defend the other party (the Indemnified Party from such claim, and shall indemnify the Indemnified Party and hold the Indemnified Party harmless from any and all Claims incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending against the claim. The provisions of this Section 13 shall survive the Closing or, if the purchase and sale is not consummated, any termination of this Agreement. 
 14. Notices. Any notice, demand, approval, consent, or other communication required or desired to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing in the manner set forth below, addressed to the party to be served at the addresses set forth beneath such party s signature on this Agreement, or at such other address for which that party may have given notice under the provisions of this Section.

Any notice to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement may be delivered by either Buyer or its counsel or Seller or its counsel and the delivery of notice by counsel instead of the applicable Buyer or Seller is expressly permitted and agreed to by the parties to this Agreement.

The foregoing shall not prohibit Buyer from communicating with public agencies or other third parties in connection with its due diligence or pursuing entitlements and/or approvals prior to Closing; provided, that Buyer maintains the confidentiality of Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Closing, either party shall have the right to disclose information with respect to the Property to its officers, directors, members, partners, employees, attorneys, accountants, environmental auditors, engineers, current and potential lenders, investors, insurers and permitted assignees under this Agreement and other consultants to the extent necessary to evaluate the transactions contemplated hereby and the Property provided that all such persons are told that such information is confidential and agree to keep such information confidential.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the foregoing indemnity shall not cover, apply to or include, and Seller shall not be liable or responsible under this Agreement for, any punitive or exemplary damages, unless such punitive or exemplary damages are assessed against the Buyer by third parties, due to an action or omission to act of Seller.

 Section 1.6 Rates . The interest rate on Loans denominated in Dollars or an Alternate Currency may be determined by reference to a benchmark rate that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform or cessation. Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative reference rates for some of these benchmark rates and, as a result, such benchmark rates may cease to comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued or the basis on which they are calculated may change. The London interbank offered rate, which may be one of the benchmark rates with reference to which the interest rate on Loans may be determined, is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration IBA ), the administrator of the London interbank offered rate, and the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA ), the regulatory supervisor of IBA, announced in public statements (the Announcements that the final publication or representativeness date for the London interbank offered rate for: (a) Sterling, Yen and Euros will be December 31, 2021, (b) Dollars for 1-week and 2-month tenor settings will be December 31, 2021 and (c) Dollars for overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenor settings will be June 30, 2023. No successor administrator for IBA was identified in such Announcements. As a result, it is possible that commencing immediately after such dates, the London interbank offered rate for such currencies and tenors may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed a representative reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on applicable Loans. There is no assurance that the dates set forth in the Announcements will not change or that IBA or the FCA will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition or characteristics of any London interbank offered rate. Public and private sector industry initiatives have been and continue, as of the date hereof, to be underway to implement new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of London interbank offered rates. In the event that the London interbank offered rate or any other then-current Benchmark is no longer available or in certain other circumstances set forth in Section 3.5(c) , such Section 3.5(c) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Agent will notify the Borrower, pursuant to 

 44 192068782_9 

Section 3.5(c) , of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Loans is based. However, the Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, (i) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate, the rates in the definition of Eurodollar Rate or any Benchmark, any component definition thereof or rates referenced in the definition thereof or with respect to any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any then-current Benchmark or any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement), as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.5(c) , will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, such Benchmark or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability, or (ii) the effect, implementation or composition of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. The Agent and its Affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of a Benchmark, any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto and such transactions may be adverse to the Borrower. The Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any Benchmark, any component definition thereof or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service. 
 Section 1.7 Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents . 
 (a) The Agent or the applicable Fronting Lender (with notice thereof to the Agent), as applicable, shall determine the Dollar Equivalent amounts of Credit Events denominated in Alternate Currencies.

Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by the US Borrower hereunder or calculating financial covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any Currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as so determined by the Agent or the applicable Fronting Lender, as applicable.

is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

Each Lender is hereby authorized to record on its records such Lender s pro rata share of the amounts paid and not reimbursed on the Letters of Credit. In addition, each Lender agrees to risk participate in the Existing Letters of Credit as provided in subsection (vi) below.

Once any such Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions has been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) Agent (and the Fronting Lender) to permit at any time the renewal of such Letter of Credit to an expiry date not later than one year after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. 
 (viii) Letters of Credit Outstanding Beyond the Revolving Credit Maturity Date .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if a Lender shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum amount permitted by such statute, then the Lender shall pay an amount equal to such excess to such Foreign Borrower. Any amount or rate of interest referred to in this Article II with respect to the foreign extensions of credit shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest over the term that such extensions of credit remain outstanding on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall within the meaning of interest shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be pro-rated over that period of time and otherwise be pro-rated over the Commitment Period and, in the event of a dispute, a certificate of an actuary appointed by Agent (and reasonably acceptable to US Borrower) shall be conclusive for the purposes of such determination.

 62 192068782_9 

hold in connection with such obligations secured and it shall not be necessary for Agent and the Lenders to proceed upon or against or exhaust any other security or remedy before proceeding to enforce their rights against such Borrower.

So long as no Event of Default then exists, then US Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such non-extending Lender and Agent, require such non-extending Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.10 ), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Transferee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) US Borrower shall have paid to Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 11.10 and (ii) such non-extending Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Revolving Loans, Swing Loans and participations in Letters of Credit, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or US Borrower (in the case of all other amounts). 
 (c) On the Revolving Credit Maturity Date for any non-extending Lenders, (i) US Borrower shall repay all outstanding Revolving Loans due and payable to such non-extending Lenders (together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and accrued and unpaid commitment fees hereunder), (ii) each of the non-extending Lenders shall be automatically released from their respective risk participation obligations under Section 2.2(b)(v) hereof with respect to any outstanding Swing Loans and under Section 2.2(c)(iii) hereof with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit, (iii) all outstanding Revolving Loans, risk participation obligations with respect to any outstanding Swing Loans and risk participation obligations with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit (and the related Letter of Credit Exposure) shall be automatically reallocated among the extending Lenders based on each such Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment and (iv) to the extent that the Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to such reallocation pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (iii), US Borrower shall prepay Revolving Loans, Swing Loans or Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit in accordance with Section 3.7 hereof. 
 (d) Any extension shall be effective as of the date of the amendment effecting such extension and each such amendment shall be conditioned upon (i) no Default or Event of Default, (ii) accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and (iii) such other conditions as each extending Lender shall require. The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with US Borrower as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of Agent and US Borrower in order to extend the Revolving Credit Maturity Date on terms consistent with this Section 2.15 . US Borrower shall pay any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees or other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of Agent in connection with the documentation of any such extension, as well as such other fees, if any, as may be agreed upon between Borrowers and Agent. 
 (e) Unless Agent, the Fronting Lender and Swing Line Lender have each agreed in their respective sole discretions to act as Agent, Fronting Lender or Swing Line Lender (as the case may be) following the extended Revolving Credit Maturity Date, a successor Agent, Fronting Lender or Swing Line 

 65 192068782_9 

Lender (as the case may be) shall have been appointed by the Lenders to act as Agent, Fronting Lender or Swing Line Lender (as the case may be) commencing on the extended Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

 (a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall: 
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or advances, loans or other credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate) or any Fronting Lender; 
 (ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 3.1 shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 3.2 hereof. 
 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender or any Fronting Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such Fronting Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s or such Fronting Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such Fronting Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such Fronting Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Fronting Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Fronting Lender or such Lender s or such Fronting Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law other than due to Taxes which, for the avoidance of doubt, are covered by Section 3.2 hereof (taking into consideration such Lender s or such Fronting Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Fronting Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then upon written request of such Lender or such Fronting Lender, the Borrowers shall promptly pay to such Lender or such Fronting Lender in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 3.1 , as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will

 (c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender, a Fronting Lender or such other Recipient setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Fronting Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined, such other Recipient or any of their respective holding companies, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 3.1 and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided , however, that such certificate shall state that it is the general policy or practice of such Lender, Fronting Lender or other Recipient, as applicable, to exercise similar rights (where available) in relation to other borrowers under syndicated credit facilities that are similarly impacted by the circumstances described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 3.1 . The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such Fronting Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof. 
 (d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Fronting Lender or such other Recipient to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such Fronting Lender s or such other Recipient s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate any Lender or an Fronting Lender or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section 3.1 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than ninety (90) days prior to the date that such Lender or such Fronting Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s or such Fronting Lender s or such other Recipient s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the ninety-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 
 Section 3.2 Taxes . 
 (a) Defined Terms . For purposes of this Section 3.2 , the term Lender includes any Fronting Lender and the term applicable law includes FATCA. 
 (b) Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.2 ), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Credit Parties . The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 (d) Indemnification by the Credit Parties . The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable 

 67 192068782_9 

under this Section 3.2 payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Administrative Borrower by a Recipient (with a copy to Agent), or by Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (e) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.10(c) hereof relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to Agent under this paragraph (e). 
 (f) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.2 , such Credit Party shall deliver to Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Agent.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Administrative Borrower or Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Administrative Borrower or Agent as will enable the Administrative Borrower or Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.2(g)(ii)(A) , (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is a U.S. Person: 
 (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Administrative Borrower and Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the

 (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to 

 69 192068782_9 

comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Borrower and Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Administrative Borrower or Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Borrower or Agent as may be necessary for the Administrative Borrower and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 (i) [ Reserved ]. 
 (j) Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section 3.2 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 
 Section 3.3 Funding Losses . US Borrower (and the appropriate Foreign Borrower) agrees to indemnify each Lender, promptly after receipt of a written request therefor, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by a Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loans after such Borrower has given a notice (including a written or verbal notice that is subsequently revoked) requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by a Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loans after such Borrower has given a notice (including a written or verbal notice that is subsequently revoked) thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of a Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loan on a day 

 70 192068782_9 

that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any conversion of a Term RFR Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or (e) any compulsory assignment of such Lender s interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.4(b) hereof. Such indemnification shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amounts so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the appropriate London interbank market, along with any administration fee charged by such Lender. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 submitted to Administrative Borrower (with a copy to Agent) by any Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

 Section 3.4 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . 
 (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office .

The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 (b) Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.1 hereof, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof, or if any Lender shall cease to make available Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loans or Term RFR Loans pursuant to Section 3.5(a) or Section 3.5(b) hereof, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.4(a) hereof that eliminates the amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 hereof, as the case may be, or allows such Lender to continue to make or maintain Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loans, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Administrative Borrower may, at Borrowers sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.10 hereof), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 hereof) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Transferee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that: 
 (i) the Borrowers shall have paid to Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 11.10 hereof; 

 71 192068782_9 

(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and, if applicable, participations in Letters of Credit, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.3 hereof) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts); 
 (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.1 hereof, or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
 (iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and 
 (v) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
 
 A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Administrative Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that if it is replaced pursuant to this Section 3.4 , it shall execute and deliver to Agent an Assignment Agreement to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to Agent any promissory note (if the assigning Lender s Loans are evidenced by one or more promissory notes) subject to such Assignment Agreement; provided that the failure of any Lender replaced pursuant to this Section 3.4 to execute an Assignment Agreement or deliver such promissory notes shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in the Register and the promissory notes shall be deemed cancelled upon such failure. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Lender s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Lender and in the name of such Lender, from time to time in Agent s discretion, with prior written notice to such Lender, to take any action and to execute any such Assignment Agreement or other instrument that Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Section 3.4(b) . Section 3.5 Changed Circumstances .

Interest Periods) until the Agent revokes such notice and (B) if such determination affects the calculation of Base Rate, the Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate until the Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Administrative Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of RFR Loans in each such affected Currency (to the extent of the affected RFR Loans or, in the case of a Term RFR Loans, the affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, (I) in the case of any request for a b orrowing of an affected RFR Loan in Dollars, the Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (II) in the case of any request for a b orrowing of an affected RFR Loan in an Alternate Currency, then such request shall be ineffective and (B)(I) any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in Dollars will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans immediately or, in the case of Term RFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (II) any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in an Alternate Currency, at the Borrowers election, shall either (1) be converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternate Currency) immediately or, in the case of Term RFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period or (2) be prepaid in full, together with accrued interest thereon (subject to Section 2.3(d) ), immediately or, in the case of Term RFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period; provided that if no election is made by the Borrowers by the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by the Administrative Borrower of such notice or, in the case of Term RFR Loans, the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable RFR Loan, if earlier, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected clause (1) above. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 11.6 . 
 (ii) Subject to clause (c) below, if, for any reason (x) on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period with respect to a Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loan or (y) prior to the USD LIBOR Transition Date, on any day with respect to a Base Rate Loan, in connection with a request therefor, a conversion to or a continuation thereof or otherwise, (A) the Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that deposits are not being offered to banks in the London or other applicable offshore interbank market for the applicable Currency, amount and Interest Period of such Loan (or, with respect to any Base Rate Loan, for a one month term), (B) the Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that a fundamental change has occurred in the foreign exchange or interbank markets with respect to the applicable Alternate Currency (including changes in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls), (C) the Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Currency and Interest Period, including because the Screen Rate for the applicable Currency is not available or published on a current basis, or (D) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period and shall have provided notice of such determination to the Agent, then the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Borrower. Thereafter, until the Agent notifies the Administrative Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (x) any obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loans in each such Currency, and any right of the Borrowers to convert any Loan in each such Currency (if applicable) or continue any Loan as a Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loan is each such Currency (in each case, to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loans or Interest Periods), shall be suspended and (I) any outstanding affected Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loans denominated in Dollars will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (II) any outstanding affected Eurodollar Fixed Rate Loans

Each Credit Party agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from the other Lenders or any thereof pursuant to this Section 8.5 , or exercising rights under this provision, may exercise all of its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation or otherwise as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of such participation.
