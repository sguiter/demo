common shares to its sole shareholder. 

On
August 28, 2017, AITX completed the acquisition of RAD (the Acquisition ), whereby AITX acquired all the ownership and equity
interest in RAD for shares of AITX Series E Preferred Stock and shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. AITX s
prior business focus was transportation services, and was exploring the on-demand logistics market by developing a network of logistics
partnerships. As a result of the closing of the Acquisition, AITX has succeeded to the business of RAD, and AITX s business going
forward will consist of one segment activity, which is the delivery of artificial intelligence and robotic solutions for operational,
security and monitoring needs. 

The
Acquisition was treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes since
substantially all of AITX s operations were disposed of as part of the consummation of the transaction. Therefore, no goodwill
or other intangible assets were recorded by AITX as a result of the Acquisition. RAD is treated as the accounting acquirer as its stockholders
control the Company after the Acquisition, even though AITX was the legal acquirer. As a result, the assets and liabilities and the historical
operations that are reflected in these financial statements are those of RAD as if RAD had always been the reporting company. 

. As of August 31, 2024,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of , and negative working capital of Management does not anticipate having
positive cash flow from operations in the near future. These factors raise a substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. 

The
Company does not have the resources at this time to repay all its credit and debt obligations, make any payments in the form of dividends
to its shareholders or fully implement its business plan. Without additional capital, the Company will not be able to remain in business.
At the same time management points to its successful history with maintaining Company operations and reminds all with reasonable confidence
this will continue. Management has plans to address the Company s financial situation as follows: 

Management
is committed to raise either non-dilutive funds or minimally dilutive funds. There is no assurance that these funds will be able to be
raised nor can we provide assurance that these possible raises may not have dilutive effects. In July 2024, the Company entered into
an equity financing agreement whereby an investor will purchase up to of the Company s common stock at a discount over
a two-year period. There remains approximately million left to issue under this arrangement. Management believes that it has the
necessary support to continue operations by continuing its funding methods in the following ways: growing revenues, through equity proceeds,
and issuing non-convertible debt. Management has had many recent conversations with the Company s primary debt holder and believes
that the non-convertible debt on the balance sheet will be extended. Management notes that non-convertible debt on the books has been
extended by this debt holder twice in the past and notes that this debt holder has been a strong supporter of the Company.

Company continually evaluates revenue earning devices to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may
warrant revision of the estimated useful life or whether the devices should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses a
combination of the undiscounted cash flows and market approaches in assessing whether an asset has been impaired. The Company measures
impairment losses based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value.

If
at its inception, a lease meets any of the four lease criteria above, the lease is classified by the Company as a sales/finance; and
if none of the four criteria are met, the lease is classified by the Company as an operating lease. 

Operating
lease payments are recognized as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereby an equal amount
of rent expense is attributed to each period during the term of the lease, regardless of when actual payments are made. This generally
results in rent expense in excess of cash payments during the early years of a lease and rent expense less than cash payments in the
later years. The difference between rent expense recognized and actual rental payments is recorded as deferred rent and included in liabilities.

November 18, 2019, the Company entered into another similar arrangement with the (February 1, 2019) investor above whereby the investor
would advance up to in exchange for a perpetual rate Payment on the Company s quarterly Revenues (commencing on
quarter ending May 31, 2020). At February 29, 2020, the investor has advanced and the investor advanced the remainder
as of May 2020.

The overall decrease of 57,934 was primarily attributable to the following changes in operating expenses of: 

General
 and administrative expenses increased by 30,482. In comparing the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 the increase
 in G A was primarily due to increases in wages and salaries of 348,837 and subcontractors of 46,581. These increases were partially
 offset by decreases in: professional fees of 170,274, stock-based compensation of 58,984, production supplies of 19,712, marketing
 of 19,712, freight of 4,362 and travel of 79,408 

Research
 and development decreased by 117,138 due to a reduction in funding on development of future products.

 equipment. 

Operating
 lease cost and rent increased by 426.

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Cash Flows 

Management
believes that we will continue to incur losses for the immediate future. Therefore, we will need additional equity or debt financing
until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, if ever. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include and adjustments
relating to the recovery of assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

As
of August 31, 2024, we had a cash balance of 543,133, accounts receivable of 650,293, device parts inventory of 2,063,229 and 37,080,711in
current liabilities. At the current cash consumption rate, we will need to consider additional funding sources going forward. We are
taking proactive measures to reduce operating expenses and drive growth in revenue. 

The
successful outcome of future activities cannot be determined at this time and there is no assurance that, if achieved, we will have sufficient
funds to execute our intended business plan or generate positive operating results.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) as of August 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that, as of August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required
time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

1. 
 As
 of August 31, 2024, we did not maintain effective controls over our control environment. Specifically, we have not developed and
 effectively communicated to our employees our accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Further,
 the Board of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial
 expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization,
 management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness. 

2. 
 As
 of August 31, 2024, we did not maintain effective controls over financial statement disclosure. Specifically, controls were not designed
 and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Accordingly, management
 has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
