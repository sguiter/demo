of the outstanding common stock of Prime Meridian Bank (the "Bank") (collectively the "Company"). PMHG s primary activity is the operation of the Bank. The Bank is a Florida state-chartered commercial bank, and the deposit accounts of the Bank are insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The Bank offers a variety of community banking services to individual and corporate clients through its four banking offices located in Tallahassee, Crawfordville, and Lakeland, Florida and its online banking platform. 
 
 The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and to general practices within the banking industry. The condensed consolidated financial statements in the Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, but in the opinion of management, reflect all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial position and condensed consolidated results of operations. All adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and with the instructions to Form 10 -Q adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial presentation and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2023 , included in our Annual Report on Form 10 -K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024 . The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period. 
 
 Comprehensive Incom e . GAAP generally requires that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in earnings. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available for sale, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet, such items along with net earnings, are components of comprehensive income. The only component of other comprehensive income (loss) is the net change in the unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale. 
 
 S tock - Based Compensation. The Company expenses the fair value of stock options and restricted stock granted. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings over the vesting period. 
 
 Derivatives. The Company enters into interest rate swaps in order to provide commercial loan clients the ability to swap from variable to fixed interest rates. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. This swap agreement effectively converts the client s variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third -party dealer in order to offset its exposure on the client swap. The Company does not use derivatives for trading purposes. The derivative transactions are considered instruments with no hedging designation, otherwise known as stand-alone derivatives.

The unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 on and debt securities, respectively, were caused by market conditions such as interest rate movements, and not changes in credit quality. It is expected that the debt securities would not be settled at a price less than the par value of the debt securities. 
 
 Management evaluates debt securities for credit loss where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a debt security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Credit losses are calculated individually and collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the debt security. 
 
 Any credit loss component would be recognized through a credit loss expense. Consideration is given to 1 the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, 2 the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the debt securities, 3 the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, 4 our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is more-likely-than- not that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value, 5 the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, 6 credit ratings, 7 third party guarantees, and 8 collateral values. In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, management considers whether the debt securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer's financial condition, and the issuer's anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the debt securities. The Company determined that the U.S. government agency and treasury securities (including mortgage-backed securities) have a expected credit loss. All of the government agency securities have the full faith and credit backing of the United States government or one of its agencies. Municipal securities and asset-backed securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly by a third -party resource to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all municipal and asset-backed securities were rated as investment grade. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe that there is a credit loss or that a credit loss expense is necessary. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, debt securities are on nonaccrual. Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, we consider our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. We do not currently intend to sell the debt securities within the portfolio, and it is not more-likely-than- not that we will be required to sell the debt securities.

1 Certain loans as of December 31, 2023 have been reclassed to conform to current loan class presentation. 
 
 The Company has divided the loan portfolio into three portfolio segments and five portfolio classes, each with different risk characteristics and methodologies for assessing risk. All loans are underwritten based upon standards set forth in the policies approved by the Company s Board of Directors. The Company identifies the portfolio segments and classes as follows: 
 
 Real Estate Mortgage Loans. Real estate mortgage loans are typically divided into three classes: commercial, residential and home equity, and construction loans. 
 
 Commercial. Loans of this type are typically our more complex loans. This category of real estate loans is comprised of loans secured by mortgages on commercial property that are typically owner-occupied, but also includes nonowner-occupied investment properties. Commercial loans that are secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate are repaid through operating cash flows of the borrower. Commercial loans that are secured by nonowner-occupied commercial real estate are underwritten by assessing the property s current and future income potential and appraised value. For both owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied commercial loans, the maturity is generally limited to three to five years; however, payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis. Typically, interest rates on these types of loans are fixed for five years or less after which they may adjust based upon a predetermined spread over a market index rate. At times, a rate may be fixed for longer than five years. As part of our credit underwriting standards, the Company typically requires personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business supported by a review of the principal owners personal financial statements and tax returns. As part of the enterprise risk management process, it is understood that risks associated with commercial real estate loans include fluctuations in real estate values, the overall strength of the borrower and the economy, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, environmental contamination, and the quality of the borrowers management. In order to mitigate and limit these risks, we analyze the borrowers cash flows and evaluate collateral value. Currently, the collateral securing our commercial real estate loans includes a variety of property types, such as office, warehouse, hotels, commercial properties and retail facilities. Generally, commercial real estate loans present a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate loan portfolio. 
 
 Residential and Home Equity. The Company offers first and second one -to- four family mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit; the collateral for these loans is generally the clients' owner-occupied residences. Although these types of loans present lower levels of risk than commercial real estate loans, risks do still exist because of possible fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrowers' financial condition. The nonowner-occupied investment properties are more similar in risk to commercial real estate loans, and therefore, are underwritten by assessing the property s income potential and appraised value. In both cases, we underwrite the borrower s financial condition and evaluate his or her global cash flow position. Borrowers may be affected by numerous factors, including job loss, illness, or other personal hardship. As part of our product mix, the Bank offers both portfolio and secondary market mortgages; portfolio loans generally are based on a -year, -year, -year, or -year adjustable rate mortgage; while -year or -year fixed-rate loans are generally sold in the secondary market. The Company also offers multi-family and mixed-use residential loans; risks associated with these types of real estate loans include fluctuations in real estate values, the overall strength of the borrower and the economy, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, environmental contamination, and the quality of the borrowers management. In order to mitigate and limit these risks, we analyze the borrowers cash flows and evaluate the underlying collateral value. 
 
 Construction. Typically, these loans have a construction period of one to two years and the interest is paid monthly. Once the construction period terminates, some of these loans convert to a term loan with a maturity of one to ten years. This portion of our loan portfolio includes loans to small and midsized businesses to construct owner-user properties, loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties, and residential developments. This type of loan is also made to individual clients for construction of single-family homes in our market area. An independent appraisal is used to determine the value of the collateral and confirm that the ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral will not exceed policies of the Bank. As the construction project progresses, loan proceeds are requested by the borrower to complete phases of construction and funding is only disbursed after the project has been inspected by a third -party inspector or experienced construction lender. Risks associated with construction loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, project completion risk, and changes in market trends. The ability of the construction loan borrower to finance the loan or sell the property upon completion of the project is another risk factor that also may be affected by changes in market trends since the initial funding of the loan. 
 
 Commercial Loans. The Company offers a wide range of commercial loans, including business term loans, equipment financing, lines of credit, and U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. Small-to-medium sized businesses, retail, and professional establishments, make up our target market for commercial loans. Our Relationship Managers primarily underwrite these loans based on the borrower's ability to service the loan from cash flow. Lines of credit and loans secured by accounts receivable and/or inventory are monitored periodically by our staff. Loans secured by "all business assets," or a "blanket lien" are typically only made to highly qualified borrowers due to the nonspecific nature of the collateral and do not require a formal valuation of the business collateral. When commercial loans are secured by specifically identified collateral, then the valuation of the collateral is generally supported by an appraisal, purchase order, or third -party physical inspection. Personal guarantees of the principals of business borrowers are usually required. Equipment loans generally have a term of five years or less and may have a fixed or variable rate; we use conservative margins when pricing these loans. Working capital loans generally do not exceed one year and typically, they are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and personal guarantees of the principals of the business. The Bank currently offers SBA 504 and SBA 7A loans. SBA 504 loans provide financing for major fixed assets such as real estate and equipment while SBA 7A loans are generally used to establish a new business or assist in the acquisition, operation, or expansion of an existing business. With both SBA loan programs, there are set eligibility requirements and underwriting standards outlined by SBA that can change as the government alters its fiscal policy. Significant factors affecting a commercial borrower's creditworthiness include the quality of management and the ability both to evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting the business' markets for products and services and to respond effectively to such changes. These loans may be made unsecured or secured, but most are made on a secured basis. Risks associated with our commercial loan portfolio include local, regional, and national market conditions. Other factors of risk could include changes in the borrower's management and fluctuations in collateral value. Additionally, there may be refinancing risk if a commercial loan includes a balloon payment which must be refinanced or paid off at loan maturity. In reference to our risk management process, our commercial loan portfolio presents a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate and consumer loan portfolios. Therefore, we require that all loans to businesses must have a clearly stated and reasonable payment plan to allow for timely retirement of debt, unless secured by liquid collateral or as otherwise justified. 
 
 Cons umer and Other Loans . These loans are made for various consumer purposes, such as the financing of automobiles, boats, and recreational vehicles. The payment structure of these loans is normally on an installment basis. The risk associated with this category of loans stems from the reduced collateral value for a defaulted loan; the collateral may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the principal. The underwriting on these loans is primarily based on the borrower's financial condition. In many cases, these are unsecured credits that subject us to risk when the borrower's financial condition declines or deteriorates. Based upon our current trend in consumer loans, management does not anticipate consumer loans will become a substantial component of our loan portfolio at any time in the foreseeable future. Consumer loans are made at fixed and variable interest rates and are based on the appropriate amortization for the asset and purpose. 
 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. Loans classified as substandard or special mention are reviewed quarterly by the Company for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified and whether there is any impairment. All loans are graded upon initial issuance. Furthermore, construction loans, owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans, and commercial loan relationships in excess of million are reviewed at least annually. The Company determines the appropriate loan grade during the renewal process and reevaluates the loan grade in situations when a loan becomes past due. 
 
 Loans excluded from the review process above are generally classified as pass credits until: (a) they become past due; (b) management becomes aware of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the borrower; or (c) the client contacts the Company for a modification. In these circumstances, the loan is specifically evaluated for potential classification as to special mention, substandard or even charged-off. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Pass A Pass loan's primary source of loan repayment is satisfactory, with secondary sources very likely to be realized if necessary. 
 
 Special Mention A Special Mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the Company's credit position at some future date. Special Mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
 
 Substandard A Substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful A loan classified Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Loss A loan classified Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily preclude the potential for recovery, but rather signifies it is no longer practical to defer writing off the asset.

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be doubtful. Loans are returned to accrual status when the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current or when future payments are reasonably assured. The following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans in nonaccrual status and loans past due over 90 days and still on accrual by class of loans and the related ACL, if any.

Director 
 s 
 Plan 

In
 2012, the Company s Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Directors Plan. The Directors Plan permits the Company s and the Bank s non-employee directors to elect to receive any compensation to be paid to them in shares of the Company s common stock. Pursuant to the Directors Plan, each non-employee director is permitted to make an election to receive shares of stock instead of cash. To encourage directors to elect to receive stock, the Directors Plan provides that if a director elects to receive stock, he or she will receive in common stock
 of the amount of cash fees set by the Board or the Compensation Committee. The value of stock to be awarded pursuant to the Directors Plan will be the closing price of a share of common stock as traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or a price set by the Board or its Compensation Committee, acting in good faith, but in
 no case less than fair market value.
 The maximum number of shares to be issued pursuant to the Directors Plan is limited to shares. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and reporting practices applicable to the Banking industry requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and to disclose contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates and result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As discussed in Note 1 of this Form 10-Q, our policy related to the allowance for credit losses "ACL" changed on January 1, 2023 in connection with adoption of ASC 326. The amount of the ACL represents management's best estimates of current expected credit losses considering available information relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The CECL model differs from the incurred loss model previously required in that the measurement of potential loss is required to be the life of the loan and is largely based on historical loss experience by loan type. Adjustments to historical loss information may be made based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the quantitative components of the allowance model. These influences may include macroeconomic conditions, recent observable asset quality trends, regional market conditions, employment levels, and loan growth. Based upon management's assessment of these factors, the Company may apply qualitative adjustments to the allowance. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Average interest-earning assets totaled 840.2 million and 780.3 million for the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a period over period increase of 59.9 million, or 7.7 . The increase in interest-earning assets was due primarily to a 68.1 million increase in the average balance of loans, partially offset by a 19.3 million decrease in the average balance of debt securities.

Investment Securities 
 . 
 Our primary objective in managing our investment portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high quality, highly liquid investments yielding competitive returns. We use the investment securities portfolio for several purposes. It serves as a vehicle to manage interest rate and prepayment risk, to generate interest income, to provide liquidity to meet funding requirements, and to provide collateral for pledging to secure the deposit of public funds at the Bank. At 
 September 30, 2024, our debt securities available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios included highly rated U.S. government treasury and agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and municipal securities. As of the same date, the combined portfolio had a fair market value of 103.2 million and an amortized cost value of 111.9 million. At 
 September 30, 2024 and
 December 31, 2023, our investment securities portfolio represented approximately 11.2 and 16.0 of our total assets, respectively. The average yield on the average balance of investment securities for the
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.77 , compared to 2.65 for the comparable period in
 2023. 

Loans. Our primary interest-earning asset is our loan portfolio and our primary source of income is the interest earned on the loan portfolio. Our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans, construction loans, and commercial loans made to small-to-medium sized companies and their owners, as well as residential real estate and home equity loans, including multifamily loans, first and second mortgages, and consumer and other loans. Our goal is to maintain a high-quality portfolio of loans through sound underwriting and lending practices. We work diligently to attract new lending clients through direct solicitation by our loan officers, utilizing relationship networks from existing clients, competitive pricing, and innovative structure. Our loans are priced based upon the degree of risk, collateral, loan amount, and maturity. At September 30, 2024, our net loan portfolio totaled 687.1 million compared to 646.1 million at December 31, 2023. 

28

Commercial real estate ("CRE") loans represent the Company's second largest loan category. Commercial real estate loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. The Company regularly monitors its CRE portfolio against regulatory concentration thresholds. Additionally, the Company manages its risk in the CRE portfolio through, but not limited to, established policy limits on loan-to-value or loan-to-cost, the use of internal lending limits, annual reviews on borrowers and guarantors above certain total credit exposure thresholds, and minimum required debt service coverage ratios and borrower equity levels.

Nonperforming assets . Nonperforming loans totaled 2.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million at December 31, 2023. We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. We also place loans on nonaccrual status if they are less than 90 days past due if the collection of principal or interest is in doubt. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed from income. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses ("ACL") consists of the allowance for credit losses on loans, debt securities, and unfunded commitments. Management s policy is to maintain the ACL at a level sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loan, debt securities portfolio, and unfunded loan commitments as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by credit loss expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The Bank reported credit loss expense of 100,000 and 755,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 175,000 and 743,000 for the same periods in 2023. Credit loss expense in the third quarter of 2024 was comprised of 118,000 in loan related credit loss expense and an 18,000 release related to general unfunded commitments. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.26 at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.40 at December 31, 2023. The decrease in nonperforming assets from year-end is mostly attributed to net charge-offs of 800,000 during the second quarter of 2024, primarily related to two (2) previously identified impaired commercial loan relationships. At September 30, 2024, management believes the ACL, which was 5.4 million, or 0.78 of gross loans, is adequate to cover expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. 
 
 Deposits. Deposits are the major source of the Company s funds for lending and other investment purposes. Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 824.0 million, an increase of 75.3 million, or 10.1 , from December 31, 2023 . Average deposit balances for the three and nine months periods ending September 30, 2024 were up 93.0 million, or 13.0 , and 56.3 million, or 7.9 , respectively, from the same periods a year ago. The average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for 25.5 of the average balance of total deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Bank's core deposit base is well diversified with a fairly balanced volume distribution between commercial (47 and consumer (46 deposit accounts at September 30, 2024. Public accounts make up the remaining 7 . The Bank's estimated uninsured deposits were 316.3 million, or 38.4 of total deposits, including collateralized public fund accounts. 
 
 Borrowings. The Bank has an agreement with FHLB and pledges its qualified loans as collateral which would allow the Bank, as of September 30, 2024, to borrow up to 123.8 million. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had 10 million in FHLB advances. In addition, the Bank maintains unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks that totaled 59.0 million at September 30, 2024. There were no outstanding balances under these unsecured lines of credit at September 30, 2024. 
 
 In 2020, the Company entered into a Promissory Note and a Security Agreement with TNB. Pursuant to the Note, the Company obtained a 15 million revolving line of credit with a 5-year term. The interest rate adjusts daily to the then-current Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Company has pledged to TNB all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Bank. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a zero balance under this line.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Net interest income constitutes the principal source of income for the Bank and results from the excess of interest income on interest-earning assets over interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The principal interest-earning assets are investment securities and loans. Interest-bearing liabilities primarily consist of time deposits, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings deposits, and money-market accounts. Funds attracted by these interest-bearing liabilities are invested in interest-earning assets. Accordingly, net interest income depends upon the volume of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities as well as the interest rates earned or paid on these assets and liabilities. The following tables set forth information regarding: (i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend income of the Company from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average costs; (iii) net interest income; (iv) interest-rate spread; (v) net interest margin; and (vi) weighted-average yields and rates. Yields and costs were derived by dividing annualized income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities. The yields and costs depicted in the table include the amortization of fees, which are considered to constitute adjustments to yields. 
 
 As shown in the following tables, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's net interest margin ("NIM") declined compared to the same periods last year due to a narrowing of the interest rate spread, higher cost of funds, and lower percentage of noninterest bearing deposits as a part of the deposit mix.

The Company reported net interest income of 7.9 million for 3Q'24, an increase of 754,000, or 10.5 from 3Q'23. Compared to 3Q'23, loan growth and higher loan yields were the most significant contributing factors to higher net interest income. Average earning assets were up 92.8 million, or 11.9 , over 3Q'23 while the yield on average earning assets increased to 5.81 (3Q'24), compared to 5.21 (3Q'23). The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased from 2.19 in 3Q'23 to 3.09 in 3Q'24, reflecting the rising rate environment and a change in funding mix. The Company's net interest margin ("NIM") for 3Q'24 was 3.63 , compared to 3.68 (3Q'23). 
 
 Credit Loss Expense 
 
 Credit loss expense is charged to earnings to increase the ACL to a level deemed appropriate by management. The expense is primarily based upon the volume and type of lending conducted by the Company (including unfunded commitments), industry standards, general economic conditions, particularly as they relate to our market areas, and other factors related to our historic loss experience and the collectability of the loan portfolio. Credit loss expense for 3Q'24 of 100,000 included 118,000 in expense for loans and 18,000 in release for unfunded commitments. Net charge-offs totaled 11,000 in 3Q'24, compared to 49,000 in 3Q'23. At September 30, 2024, the ACL for loans was 5.4 million, representing 0.78 to total loans (this excludes the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments of 140,000).

 Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes are based on amounts reported in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings after adjustments for nontaxable income and nondeductible expenses and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Income taxes were 835,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income taxes of 668,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 with the increase attributed to higher pre-tax earnings.

Average earning assets increased 59.9 million, or 7.7 , while the Company's average interest-bearing liabilities increased 52.5 million, or 9.7 . Rates on interest-bearing liabilities increased 122 basis points while yields on interest-earning assets increased 66 basis points. NIM was 3.57 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.78 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Credit Loss Expense

The expense is primarily based upon the volume and type of lending conducted by the Company (including unfunded commitments), industry standards, general economic conditions, particularly as they relate to our market areas, and other factors related to our historic loss experience and the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company recorded credit loss expense of 755,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 743,000 in credit loss expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the ACL for loans was 5.4 million, representing 0.78 to total loans (this excludes the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments of 140,000). While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the ACL are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future losses will not exceed the amount of the established ACL, or that any increases to the ACL that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ACL is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in our adding to our ACL based upon their evaluation of information available to them at the time of examination.

Noninterest expense was up 8.9 , or 1.2 million, over the nine-month period due mostly to higher expense for salaries and employee benefits and software maintenance, amortization and other, followed by higher marketing expense. The increase in software maintenance, amortization, and other is related to the Company's core conversion which took place in the fourth quarter of 2023. The 128,000 increase in marketing expense reflects a higher budget for client development activities. The Company's efficiency ratio was 62.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 58.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are based on amounts reported in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings after adjustments for nontaxable income and nondeductible expenses and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Income taxes were 2.0 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2024, compared to income taxes of 2.2 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2023 with the decrease attributed to lower pre-tax earnings.

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations, including lending commitments and contingencies, which arise during the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company s clients, as well as meet current and planned expenditures. Management monitors the liquidity position daily. 
 
 Our liquidity is derived primarily from our deposit base, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and debt securities, funds provided by operations, and capital. Additionally, as a commercial bank, we are expected to maintain an adequate liquidity position. The liquidity position may consist of cash on hand, cash on demand deposit with correspondent banks, federal funds sold, and unpledged debt securities such as United States government treasury and agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and municipal securities. Some of our securities are pledged to collateralize certain deposits through our participation in the State of Florida s QPD program. The market value of debt securities pledged to the QPD program wa s 18.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 16.4 million at December 31, 2023 . At September 30, 2024, on-balance sheet liquidity (consisting of cash and cash equivalents and debt securities at fair value eligible for pledging) was 181.6 million, or 19.5 , of total assets compared to 146.8 million, or 17.2 , of total assets at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank also has external sources of funds through the FHLB and unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had access to approximately 123.8 million of available lines of credit secured by qualifying collateral with the FHLB, in addition to 59.0 million in unsecured lines of credit maintained with correspondent banks. The Bank had 10 million in FHLB advances at September 30, 2024. The Company also has a 15 million revolving line of credit with TNB that matures in August 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a zero outstanding balance under this line. At September 30, 2024, available secured and unsecured borrowing capacity was 197.7 million. When combined with maximum available brokered and wholesale funding capacity of 232.9 million, off balance sheet funding sources totaled 430.6 million. 
 
 Our core deposits consist of noninterest-bearing accounts, NOW accounts, money-market accounts, time deposits 250,000 or less, and savings accounts. We closely monitor our level of certificates of deposit greater than 250,000 and other large deposits. At September 30, 2024, total deposits were 824.0 million, of which 57.4 million were in certificates of deposits greater than 250,000. Deposit balances increased 75.3 million, or 10.1 , since December 31, 2023. The Bank's estimated uninsured deposits were 316.3 million, or 38.4 of total deposits, including collateralized public fund accounts. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total liquidity sources of 612.2 million, or 74.3 of total deposits, represent 194 of estimated uninsured deposits, including collateralized public fund accounts. 
 
 We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan CFP that identifies liquidity needs and weighs alternate courses of action designed to address those needs in emergency situations. We perform a monthly cash flow analysis and stress test the CFP to evaluate the expected funding needs and funding capacity during a liquidity stress event. We believe that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably immediate short-term and intermediate-term demands and do not know of any trends, events, or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse effect on our liquidity position. 
 
 CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Stockholders equity was 88.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 80.0 million at December 31, 2023. Retained earnings and a favorable change in accumulated other comprehensive loss were the two key drivers of the increase in equity. In 2020, the Company obtained a 15 million 5-year revolving line of credit with TNB. At its discretion, the Company may take draws on that line and may contribute the proceeds as capital to the Bank. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a zero balance under this line of credit. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank was considered to be well capitalized under the FDIC s Prompt Corrective Action regulations. 
 
 The following is a summary at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of the regulatory capital requirements to be well capitalized and the Bank s capital position.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon management s evaluation of those controls and procedures performed within the 90 days preceding the filing of this Report, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, subject to the limitations noted below, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by PMHG in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
 
 We intend to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and to improve the Company s controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and nonfinancial information concerning the Company s business. While we believe the present design of the disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 We have made no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 (c) Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. 
 
 The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are a party to various matters incidental to the conduct of a banking business. Presently, we believe that we are not a party to any legal proceedings in which resolution would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operation, cash flows, or capital levels. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 While the Company attempts to identify, manage, and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with its business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 describes some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. The Company has not updated any risk factors since the publication of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued 992 shares to members of its Board of Directors in lieu of cash fees calculated at 110 of the cash value to be 25,000. These shares were all issued in accordance with SEC Rule 701 and the intrastate exemption from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, because the Company is doing business within the State of Florida and each acquirer and offeree of securities is a director of the Company and resides within the State of Florida. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 
 Not applicable.
