 Company stores of which were branded as Murphy and were the QuickChek brand. The Company also has certain product supply and wholesale assets, including product distribution terminals and pipeline positions. 
 
 Basis of Presentation Murphy USA was incorporated in March 2013 and, in connection with its incorporation, Murphy USA issued shares of common stock, par value per share, to Murphy Oil Corporation Murphy Oil for . On August 30, 2013, Murphy USA was separated from Murphy Oil through the distribution of of the common stock of Murphy USA to holders of Murphy Oil stock. Murphy USA Inc., Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries operate on a calendar year basis, while the QuickChek subsidiary uses a weekly retail calendar where each quarter has 13 weeks. For the three month period ended September 30, 2024, the QuickChek results covered the period June 29, 2024 to September 27, 2024, and the 2024 year-to-date period began December 30, 2023. For the three month period ended September 30, 2023, the QuickChek results covered the period July 1, 2023 to September 29, 2023, and the 2023 year-to-date period began December 31, 2022. The difference in timing of the period ends is immaterial to the overall consolidated results. 

Interim Financial Information The interim period financial information presented in these consolidated financial statements is unaudited and includes all known accruals and adjustments, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of Murphy USA and its results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. 
 
 These interim consolidated financial statements should be read together with our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (File No. 001-35914), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on February 16, 2024.

 Total petroleum product sales Merchandise sales Other operating revenues: RINs Other revenues 2 
 Total revenues 
 
 1 Includes excise and sales taxes that remain eligible for inclusion under Topic 606 
 2 Primarily includes collection allowance on excise and sales taxes combined with other miscellaneous items 

, depending on the terms with the particular credit/debit card providers. Payment fees retained by the credit/debit card providers are recorded as Store and other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 Petroleum product sales (at wholesale). Our sales of petroleum products at wholesale are generally recorded as revenue when the deliveries have occurred and legal ownership of the product has transferred to the customer. Title transfer for bulk refined product sales typically occurs at pipeline custody points and upon trucks loading at product terminals. For bulk pipeline sales, we record receivables from customers that are generally collected within a week from custody transfer date. For our rack product sales, the majority of our customers' accounts are drafted by us within days from product transfer. 
 
 Merchandise sales. For our retail store locations, the revenue related to merchandise sales is recognized as the customer completes their purchase at our locations. The transaction price typically includes some portion of sales tax as levied in the respective jurisdictions. Those taxes that are collected for remittance to governmental entities on a pass-through basis are not recognized as revenue and they are recorded to a liability account until they are paid. As noted above, a mixture of payment types are used for these revenues and the same terms for credit/debit card receivables are realized. 
 
 With respect to merchandise sales revenue we must determine whether we are the principal or agent for some categories of merchandise such as scratch-off lottery tickets, lotto tickets, newspapers and other small categories of merchandise. For scratch-off lottery tickets, we have determined we are the principal in the majority of the jurisdictions and therefore we record those sales on a gross basis. We have some categories of merchandise (such as lotto tickets) where we are the agent and the revenues recorded for those transactions are our net commission only. 
 
 The Company offers loyalty programs through each of its branded retail locations. The customers earn rewards based on their spending or other promotional activities. These programs create a performance obligation which requires us to defer a portion of sales revenue to the loyalty program participants until they redeem their rewards.

days at Murphy branded stores, while certain QuickChek rewards require use within the month. We recognize loyalty revenue when a customer redeems an earned reward. Deferred revenue associated with both rewards programs are included in Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were immaterial. 
 
 RINs sales. For the sale of RINs, we recognize revenue when the RIN is transferred to the counter-party and the sale is completed. Receivables from our counter-parties related to the RIN sales are typically collected within of the sale. 
 
 Other revenues. Items reported as other operating revenues include collection allowances for excise and sales tax and other miscellaneous items and are recognized as revenue when the transaction is completed. 
 
 Accounts receivable 
 
 million and million of receivables, respectively, related to contracts with customers recorded. All of the trade accounts receivable related to contracts with customers outstanding at the end of each period were collected during the succeeding quarter. These receivables were generally related to credit and debit card transactions along with short term bulk and wholesale sales to our customers, which have a very short settlement window.

 Senior Notes 
 
 On April 25, 2017, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. ("MOUSA"), our primary operating subsidiary, issued million of Senior Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Senior Notes") under its existing shelf registration statement. The 2027 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and by the Company's subsidiaries that guarantee our Credit Facilities (as defined below). The indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company, MOUSA, and the restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments or investments, enter into transactions with affiliates or merge with or into other entities. 
 13

million of Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Senior Notes ). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes were used to fund, in part, the tender offer and redemption of a prior note issuance. The 2029 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and by the Company's subsidiaries that guarantee our Credit Facilities. The indenture governing the 2029 Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that are essentially identical to the covenants for the 2027 Senior Notes. 
 
 On January 29, 2021, MOUSA, issued million of Senior Notes due 2031 (the "2031 Senior Notes" and, together with the 2027 Senior Notes and the 2029 Senior Notes, the "Senior Notes"). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes were used, in part, to fund the acquisition of QuickChek and other obligations related to that transaction. The 2031 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and by the Company's subsidiaries that guarantee our Credit Facilities. The indenture governing the 2031 Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that are essentially identical to the covenants for the 2027 and 2029 Senior Notes. 
 
 The Senior Notes and related guarantees rank equally with all of our and the guarantors existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively junior to our and the guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness with respect to the Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future third-party liabilities, including trade payables, of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan 
 
 Our credit agreement consists of both a cash flow revolving credit facility and a senior secured term loan. 
 
 The credit agreement provides for a senior secured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million (the "Term Facility") (which was borrowed in full on January 29, 2021) and revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount equal to million (the "Revolving Facility", and together with the Term Facility, the "Credit Facilities"). The outstanding balance of the term loan was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. The term loan is due January 2028, and we are required to make quarterly principal payments of million, which began on July 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we had million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and million of outstanding letters of credit (which reduces the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Facility). 
 
 Interest payable on the Term Facility is based on either: 
 
 the term overnight financing rate, plus the applicable Alternative Reference Rate Committee ("ARRC") recommended credit spread adjustment (the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate 
 
 or 
 
 the Alternate Base Rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the "Prime Rate", (b) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from time to time plus per annum and (c) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus per annum, 
 
 plus, (A) in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR Rate borrowings, a spread of per annum and (B) in the case of Alternate Base Rate borrowings, a spread of per annum. 
 
 Interest payable on the Revolving Facility is based on either: 
 
 the term secured overnight financing rate, plus credit spread adjustment for all interest periods (the "Adjusted SOFR Rate"), which is subject to a floor; 
 
 or 
 
 14 

Murphy USA Inc. 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (unaudited) 

per annum and (c) the one-month Adjusted SOFR Rate plus per annum, 
 
 plus, (A) in the case of Adjusted SOFR Rate borrowings, a spread of to per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio and (B) in the case of Alternate Base Rate borrowings, spreads ranging from to per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio. 
 
 The Term Facility amortizes in quarterly installments, which commenced on July 1, 2021, at a rate of per annum. Murphy USA is also required to prepay the Term Facility with a portion of its excess cash flow, a portion of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and casualty events (subject to certain reinvestment rights) and the net cash proceeds of issuances of indebtedness not permitted under the Credit Agreement. The credit agreement allows Murphy USA to prepay, in whole or in part, the Term Facility outstanding thereunder, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, with prior notice but without premium or penalty other than breakage and redeployment costs. 
 
 The credit agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to make certain investments, to enter into sale-leaseback transactions, to make certain restricted payments, to enter into consolidations, mergers or sales of material assets and other fundamental changes, to transact with affiliates, to enter into agreements restricting the ability of subsidiaries to incur liens or pay dividends, or to make certain accounting changes. The Revolving Facility credit agreement also imposes total leverage ratio and secured net leverage ratio financial maintenance covenants which are tested quarterly. Pursuant to the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant, the Company must maintain a total leverage ratio of not more than to 1.0 with an ability in certain circumstances to temporarily increase that limit to to 1.0 and a maximum secured net leverage ratio of not more than to 1.0 with an ability in certain circumstances to temporarily increase that limit to to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. 
 
 Pursuant to the credit agreement's covenant limiting certain restricted payments, certain payments in respect of our equity interests, including dividends, when the total leverage ratio, calculated on a pro forma basis, is greater than to 1.0 could be limited. At September 30, 2024, our total leverage ratio was to 1.0 which meant our ability at that date to make restricted payments was not limited. If our total leverage ratio, on a pro forma basis, exceeds to 1.0, any restricted payments made following that time until the ratio is once again, on a pro forma basis, below to 1.0 would be limited by the covenant, which contains certain exceptions, including an ability to make restricted payments in cash in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of million or of consolidated net tangible assets over the life of the credit agreement. 
 
 All obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by Murphy USA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and all obligations under the credit agreement, including the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by certain assets of Murphy USA, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and the guarantors party to the guarantee and collateral agreement in respect thereof.

The MUSA 2023 Plan authorizes the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors the Committee to grant to non-employee directors, employees, and consultants of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, stock options (incentive stock options ("ISOs") and nonqualified stock options ("NQSO")), stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance awards or other cash-

million shares (subject to certain adjustments). 
 
 Beginning with its initial quarterly dividend in December 2020, the Company issued dividend equivalent units ("DEUs") on all outstanding, unvested equity awards (except stock options) in an amount commensurate with regular quarterly dividends paid on common stock. The terms of the DEUs mirror the underlying awards and will only vest if the related award vests. DEUs issued are included with grants in each respective table as applicable. 
 
 STOCK OPTIONS The Committee fixes the option price of each option granted at no less than fair market value ("FMV") on the date of the grant and fixes the option term at no more than years from such date. Most of the nonqualified stock options granted in 2024 to certain employees by the Committee were granted in February 2024. The Black-Scholes valuation for these awards was per option.

DIRECTOR DEFERRED STOCK UNITS (MUSA 2023 Plan) Non-employee directors can elect to receive their annual cash retainers in the form of Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs"). The DSUs are recognized at their fair value on the date of the grant. Director fees which are deferred into DSUs are calculated and expensed each quarter by taking fees earned during the quarter and dividing by the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of the quarter. Each DSU represents the right to receive share of common stock following the completion of a director's service. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we granted DSUs and recorded director expense of million related to the grants. At September 30, 2024, there were Director DSUs vested and outstanding with an average grant date fair value of per unit under the MUSA 2023 Plan. 
 
 PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS The Committee has granted performance-based restricted stock units (performance units or "PSUs") to its executives and certain other employees. In February 2024, the Committee awarded PSUs to certain employees. Half of the PSUs vest based on a return on average capital employed ("ROACE") calculation and the other half vest based on a total shareholder return ("TSR") calculation that compares MUSA to a group of peer companies. The portion of the awards that vest based on TSR qualify as a market condition and must be valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For the TSR portion of the awards, the fair value was determined to be per unit. For the ROACE portion of the awards, the valuation was based on the grant date fair value of per unit and the number of awards will be periodically assessed to determine the probability of vesting.

million per occurrence, general liability insurance with a self-insured retention of million per occurrence, and auto liability insurance with a deductible of million per occurrence. As of September 30, 2024, there were a number of outstanding claims that are of a routine nature. The estimated incurred but unpaid liabilities relating to these claims are included in Trade account payables and accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot presently be determined, management believes that the accrued liability of million will be sufficient to cover the related liability for all insurance claims and that the ultimate disposition of these claims will have no material effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
 
 The Company has obtained insurance coverage as appropriate for the business in which it is engaged but may incur losses that are not covered by insurance or reserves, in whole or in part, and such losses could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 
 
 TAX MATTERS Murphy USA is subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use and gross receipts taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities because of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. 
 
 OTHER MATTERS In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. At September 30, 2024, the Company had contingent liabilities of million on outstanding letters of credit. The Company has not accrued a liability in its balance sheet related to these financial guarantees and letters of credit because it is believed that the likelihood of having these drawn is remote.

Most leases include or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from to years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. Due to the uncertainties of future markets, economic factors, technology changes, demographic shifts and behavior, environmental regulatory requirements and other information that impacts decisions as to store location, management has determined that it was not reasonably certain to exercise contract options and they are not included in the lease term. Additionally, short-term leases and leases with variable lease costs are immaterial. The Company reviews all options to extend, terminate, or otherwise modify its lease agreements to determine if changes are required to the right-of-use assets and liabilities.

Our Business 
 
 The Company owns and operates a chain of retail stores that market gasoline and other merchandise under the brand names of Murphy USA and Murphy Express, most of which are located in close proximity to Walmart stores, principally in the Southeast, Midwest and Southwest areas of the United States. We also have a mix of convenience stores and retail gasoline stores located in New Jersey and New York that operate under the brand name of QuickChek and comprises our Northeast region. At September 30, 2024, we had a total of 1,740 Company stores in 27 states, of which 1,586 were Murphy branded and 154 were under the QuickChek brand. We also market petroleum products to unbranded wholesale customers through a mixture of Company-owned and third-party terminals. 

Basis of Presentation 
 
 Murphy USA was incorporated in March 2013, and until the separation from Murphy Oil Corporation was completed on August 30, 2013, it had not commenced operations and had no material assets, liabilities or commitments. The financial information presented in this Management s Discussion and Analysis is derived from the consolidated financial statements of Murphy USA Inc. and its subsidiaries for all periods presented. Our QuickChek subsidiaries use a weekly retail calendar where each quarter typically has 13 weeks. For Q3 2024, 
 the QuickChek results cover the period June 29, 2024 to September 27, 2024, and the 2024 year-to-date period began December 30, 2023. For Q3 2023, the QuickChek results cover the period July 1, 2023 to September 29, 2023, and the 2023 year-to-date period began December 31, 2022. The difference in the timing of the period ends is immaterial to the overall consolidated results. 

Trends Affecting Our Business 
 
 Our operations are significantly impacted by the gross margins we receive on our fuel and merchandise sales. The fuel gross margins are commodity-based, change daily, and are volatile. While we generally expect our volume and gross margins to remain stable in a normalized environment, they can change rapidly due to many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the price of refined products, geopolitical events that disrupt the global supply, overall demand and prices of crude oil, interruptions in our fuel and merchandise supply chain caused by severe weather or pandemics, the effects from pandemics such as travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders imposed during a pandemic, new or changing legislation around nicotine products and e-cigarettes as well as fuel economy and vehicle emission standards, severe refinery mechanical failures for an extended period of time, cyber-attacks against the Company or our vendors, changing economic conditions that lower consumer purchasing power such as inflation, and competition in the local markets in which we operate. 
 
 The cost of our main fuel products, gasoline and diesel, is greatly impacted by the cost of crude oil in the United States. Historically, a rising price environment for crude oil increases the Company s cost for wholesale fuel products purchased, which in turn increases retail fuel prices. Rising prices can cause consumers to reduce discretionary fuel consumption, however our low-price model can also serve as a hedge to draw new customers which can offset the potential loss of discretionary volumes. In Q3 2024, crude oil prices were more volatile than Q2 2024 with prices ranging from 67 per barrel to 85 per barrel with an average price of 76 per barrel in Q3 2024, compared to a average price of 82 per barrel in Q3 2023. Total fuel contribution (retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale ("PS W") results which include Renewable Identification Numbers ("RINs")) was 32.6 cents per gallon ("cpg") in Q3 2024, compared to 34.5 cpg in Q3 2023. Retail fuel margin dollars increased 13.5 in the current quarter and retail fuel volumes increased 2.0 when compared to Q3 2023. 
 
 Our revenues are impacted by the ability to leverage our diverse supply infrastructure in pursuit of obtaining the lowest cost of fuel supply available; for example, activities such as blending bulk fuel with renewable fuels (ethanol and bio-diesel) to capture and subsequently sell RINs. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA is authorized to set annual quotas establishing the percentage of motor fuels consumed in the United States that must be attributable to renewable fuels. Obligated parties are required to demonstrate that they have met any applicable quotas by submitting a certain amount of RINs to the EPA. RINs in excess of the set quota can be sold in a market for RINs at then-prevailing prices. The market price for RINs fluctuates based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to governmental and regulatory action. There are other market related factors that can impact the revenue received for RINs on a company-wide basis either favorably or unfavorably. The Renewable Fuel Standard ("RFS") program continues to be unpredictable and prices received by us for ethanol RINs averaged 0.60 per RIN in Q3 2024 compared to 1.41 per RIN in Q3 2023. Our business model does not depend on our ability to generate revenues from RINs, and we have historically observed that changes in revenue are typically coupled with offsetting changes in cost of goods that minimizes the majority of any revenue movement. Revenue from the sales of RINs is included in Other operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.3 billion of Senior Notes and a 387 million term loan outstanding. We believe that we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our ongoing operating requirements and service our debt obligations. We had additional available capacity under the committed 350 million cash flow revolving credit facility, which had 41.0 million of outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024. We expect to use the credit facilities to provide us with available financing to meet any short-term ongoing cash needs in excess of internally generated cash flows. To the extent necessary, we will borrow under these facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other corporate initiatives. There can be no assurances, however, that we will generate sufficient cash from operations or be able to draw on the credit facilities, obtain commitments for our incremental facility, or obtain and draw upon other credit facilities. For additional information, see Significant Sources of Capital in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section. 
 
 The Company currently anticipates total capital expenditures (including land for future developments) for the full year 2024 to range from approximately 500 million to 525 million depending on how many new stores are 
 completed. We intend to fund the remainder of our capital program in 2024 primarily using operating cash flow but will supplement funding where necessary through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 
 
 We believe that our business will continue to grow in the future as we maintain a pipeline of desirable future store locations for development. The pace of this growth is continually monitored by our management, and these plans can be altered based on operating cash flows generated and the availability of debt facilities. In addition, the Company looks to expand additional capabilities such as food and beverage within our network. 
 
 We currently estimate our ongoing effective tax rate to be between 24 and 26 for the remainder of the year. 

Seasonality 
 
 Our business has inherent seasonality due to the concentration of our retail stores in certain geographic areas, as well as customer behaviors during different seasons. In general, sales volumes and operating incomes are typically highest in the second and third quarters during the summer-activity months and lowest during the winter months. As a result, operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be expected for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2024. 

Business Segment 
 
 The Company has one operating segment which is Marketing. The Marketing segment includes our retail marketing stores and product supply and wholesale assets. For additional operating segment information, see Note 22 Business Segments in the audited combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included with our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 16 Business Segments in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Consolidated Results 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 149.2 million, or 7.20 per diluted share, on revenue of 5.2 billion. Net income was 167.7 million for the same period in 2023, or 7.69 per diluted share, on 5.8 billion of revenue. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower total fuel contribution with increases in store operating expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, which were partially offset by higher retail fuel sales volumes, higher overall merchandise contributions and lower income tax expense. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 360.0 million, or 17.17 per diluted share, on revenue of 15.5 billion. Net income for the same period in 2023 was 406.8 million, or 18.47 per diluted share, on 16.5 billion of revenue. The decrease in net income is primarily due to lower total fuel contribution combined with increases in store operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and general and administrative expenses, which were partially offset by higher overall merchandise contributions, higher fuel sales volumes and lower income tax expense. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues for Q3 2024 decreased 0.6 billion, or 9.6 , compared to the same quarter in 2023. The decrease in revenues was due to 10.9 lower retail fuel sales prices and lower PS W revenues, which were partially offset by an increase of 2.0 in fuel sales volumes and a 2.5 increase in merchandise sales revenue. 
 
 Cost of sales in Q3 2024 decreased 0.5 billion, or 10.6 , when compared to Q3 2023. In the current-year quarter, the decrease was primarily due to lower fuel cost and was partially offset by higher fuel volumes sold and higher merchandise costs. 
 
 Store and other operating expenses increased 10.5 million, or 4.0 , in Q3 2024 from Q3 2023, primarily due to higher employee related expenses and maintenance costs at existing stores combined with increases from net new store operating expenses, partially offset by a reduction in payment fees. 
 28 

Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses for Q3 2024 were relatively flat when compared to Q3 2023. Increases in the current-year quarter in wages, employee related costs and professional and technology services for business improvement initiatives were offset by a reduction in incentive costs in the current quarter. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5.3 million in Q3, or 9.2 , when compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to the increased number of Murphy branded stores with larger formats and raze-and-rebuild activity in the quarter. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was approximately 24.9 for both Q3 2024 and Q3 2023. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Year-to-date revenues decreased 0.9 billion, or 5.6 , compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in revenues was due to 5.8 lower retail fuel sales prices and lower PS W revenues, which was partially offset by a 3.0 increase in merchandise sales revenue and a 0.8 increase in retail fuel sales volumes. 
 
 Year-to-date cost of sales decreased 0.9 billion, or 6.2 , compared to the same period in 2023. In the current-year period, the lower costs were primarily due to lower fuel cost, partially offset by higher fuel volumes sold and higher merchandise costs. 
 
 Year-to-date store and other operating expenses increased 37.5 million, or 4.9 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher employee related expenses and maintenance costs at existing stores combined with increases in net new store operating expenses, partially offset by slightly lower payment fees. 
 
 SG A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased 2.8 million, or 1.6 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in SG A costs is primarily due to higher wages, employee related costs, and professional and technology services for business improvement initiatives, which were partially offset by a reduction in incentive cost, versus the same period of 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 9.1 million, or 5.3 , year-to-date from the same period of 2023 primarily due to the increased number of Murphy branded stores with larger formats and raze-and-rebuild activity during the period. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was approximately 24.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus approximately 24.4 for the same period of 2023.

 Same store sales ("SSS") metric includes aggregated individual store results for all stores open throughout both periods presented. For all periods presented, the store must have been open for the entire calendar year to be included in the comparison. Remodeled stores that remained open or were closed for just a very brief time (less than a month) during the period being compared remain in the same store sales calculation. If a store is replaced either at the same location (raze-and-rebuild) or relocated to a new location, it will be excluded from the calculation during the period it is out of service. Newly constructed stores do not enter the calculation until they are open for each full calendar year for the periods being compared (open by January 1, 2023 for the stores being compared in the 2024 versus 2023 comparison). Acquired stores are not included in the calculation of same stores for the first 12 months after the acquisition. When prior period same store sales volumes or sales are presented, they have not been revised for current year activity for raze-and-rebuilds, asset acquisitions and asset dispositions.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income in the Marketing segment for Q3 2024 decreased 19.2 million, to 168.0 million when compared to the Q3 2023 period. The decrease was primarily due to lower total fuel contribution combined with increases in store operating expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses, which were partially offset by higher fuel sales volumes, higher merchandise contributions and lower income tax expense. 
 
 Total fuel contribution for Q3 2024, was 404.2 million, a decrease of 14.8 million, or 3.5 , compared to Q3 2023. This decrease was due to lower contribution from PS W margins, which were partially offset by higher 
 32 

retail fuel contribution and higher fuel volumes sold in the period when compared to Q3 of 2023. Retail fuel margins on a cpg basis increased 11.2 in Q3 2024 to 31.9 cpg, compared to 28.7 cpg in the prior year period. Total retail fuel volumes increased 2.0 , and fuel sales volumes on an SSS basis increased 0.5 in Q3 2024 when compared to Q3 2023. Total product supply and wholesale contribution dollars, including RINs, decreased 61.9 million in Q3 2024 when compared to Q3 2023, primarily due to negative impacts of timing and inventory pricing adjustments in a falling market. 
 
 Total merchandise sales were 26.8 million higher in Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023, coming in at 1.1 billion in both quarters. Total merchandise contribution in Q3 2024 improved 2.4 compared to Q3 2023 primarily due to higher retail prices, up 7.8 , and net increased number of larger format stores. Total SSS merchandise contribution dollars grew 1.2 , which included an increase of 6.1 in nicotine products, partially offset by a 2.7 decrease in non-nicotine products. 
 
 Store and other operating expenses increased 10.6 million in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023, primarily due to higher employee related expenses and maintenance costs at existing stores combined with net new store operating expenses, partially offset by a reduction in payment fees. On an APSM basis, expenses applicable to store OPEX excluding payment fees and rent were 4.0 higher, primarily attributable to increased employee related expenses and maintenance costs. 
 
 SG A expenses in Q3 2024 were relatively flat when compared to Q3 2023, due primarily to reductions in employee incentive cost offsetting the increases in wages, employee related costs and professional and technology services for business improvement initiatives in the quarter. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5.2 million, or 9.8 , in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 due to the increased number of larger format Murphy branded stores and raze-and-rebuild activity in the quarter. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income in the Marketing segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 47.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower total fuel contributions, combined with increased store operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and SG A expenses, which were partially offset by higher fuel sales volumes, higher overall merchandise contributions and lower income tax expense. 
 
 Total fuel contribution for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 billion, a decrease of 34.1 million, or 3.1 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower contribution from PS W margins, and was partially offset by higher retail fuel contribution and fuel volumes sold in the period when compared to the first nine months of 2023. Retail fuel margins on a cpg basis increased 5.7 , to 27.9 cpg, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.4 cpg in the same period of 2023. Total retail fuel sales volumes increased 0.8 , while volumes on an SSS basis decreased 0.6 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same nine-month period of 2023. Total product supply and wholesale contribution dollars, including RINs, decreased 97.0 million compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to negative impacts of timing of transactions and regional supply imbalances. 
 
 Total merchandise sales increased 3.0 to 3.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023 due to higher retail prices across the chain in most categories and increased number of stores with larger formats. Year-to-date total merchandise contribution in 2024 increased 3.2 compared to the same period of 2023. Total SSS merchandise contribution dollars improved 2.8 with an increase of 8.2 in nicotine products and was partially offset by a 1.5 decrease in non-nicotine products. 
 
 Store and other operating expenses increased 37.5 million in the current year compared to the same nine-month period of 2023, primarily due to employee related expenses and maintenance expenses at existing stores combined with net new store operating expenses. On an APSM basis, expenses applicable to store OPEX excluding payment fees and rent increased 5.7 , primarily due to employee related expenses and maintenance costs. 
 
 33 

SG A expenses increased 2.8 million in 2024 compared to the same nine-month period of 2023 due primarily to higher employee salaries and benefits costs incurred and professional and technology services for business improvement initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in employee incentive cost. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10.2 million, or 6.4 , in the first nine months of 2024 due to new larger store formats for Murphy branded stores combined with raze-and-rebuild activities. 

Corporate and Other Assets 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Loss from continuing operations for Corporate and other assets for Q3 2024 was 18.8 million, compared to a loss of 19.5 million in Q3 2023. The decrease in loss was primarily due to an increase in other nonoperating income which was partially offset by a reduction in investment income. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Loss from continuing operations for Corporate and other assets was 57.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 58.0 million in the same period of 2023. The year-to-date loss for 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, had a reduction in depreciation expense combined with an increase in other nonoperating income but was partially offset by a reduction in investment income and an increase in interest expense. 

Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 The following table sets forth the Company s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. EBITDA means net income (loss) plus net interest expense, plus income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA adds back (i) other non-cash items (e.g., impairment of properties and accretion of asset retirement obligations) and (ii) other items that management does not consider to be meaningful in assessing our operating performance (e.g., (income) from discontinued operations, net settlement proceeds, (gain) loss on sale of assets, loss on early debt extinguishment, transaction and integration costs related to acquisition, and other non-operating (income) expense). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures that are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA in our operational and financial decision-making, believing that the measure is useful to eliminate certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by many of our investors, research analysts, investment bankers, and lenders to assess our operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it allows understanding of a key measure that we evaluate internally when making operating and strategic decisions, preparing our annual plan, and evaluating our overall performance. However, non-GAAP measures are not a substitute for GAAP disclosures, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be prepared differently by us than by other companies using similarly titled non-GAAP measures.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 
 Significant Sources of Capital 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 52.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and total marketable securities of 1.5 million. Our cash management policy provides that cash balances in excess of a certain threshold may be reinvested in certain types of low-risk investments. We have a committed cash flow revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility of 350 million, which can be utilized for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including supporting our operating model as described herein. Additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility may be extended at our request and with the consent of the participating lenders. As of September 30, 2024, there was 41.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Facility reported in Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Revolving Facility was undrawn at December 31, 2023. 
 
 We believe our existing cash on hand and future borrowing capacity of our existing facilities is adequate to fund not only our operations, but also our anticipated near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, execution of announced share repurchase programs, potential dividend payments, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 598.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 510.9 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 88.0 million, or 17.2 . The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is mainly due to an increase in the amount of cash provided from changes in noncash working capital of 129.2 million and increased depreciation of 9.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income of 46.8 million and lower deferred and noncurrent tax changes of 4.1 million when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating cash provided by changes in non-cash operating working capital of 32.0 million was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of 71.4 million due to the timing of receipts, an increase of 39.7 million in income taxes payable due in part to phase-out of federal bonus depreciation resulting in higher current tax expense and the timing of estimated tax payments, a decrease in inventory of 0.1 million, and was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 75.3 million which was related to the timing of payments and an increase in prepaid expenses of 3.9 million. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash required by investing activities was 320.9 million compared to 217.0 million in 2023. The 103.9 million increase in cash required by investing activities in the 
 35 

current year period was primarily due to an increase of 106.5 million in capital expenditures due to the timing of projects partially offset by net cash received of 3.3 million from the amount of maturities of marketable securities. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 required cash of 343.3 million compared to cash of 229.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 113.7 million. The first nine months of 2024 included payments of 317.7 million for the repurchase of common shares, which was an increase of 145.0 million compared to repurchases of 172.7 million in the 2023 period. Amounts related to share-based compensation required 7.2 million more in cash during 2024 than in 2023. Dividend payments increased 2.4 million in 2024 compared to amounts paid in the first nine months of 2023. Net borrowings of debt provided 29.3 million in 2024 compared to net repayments of debt requiring 11.6 million in 2023. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid cash dividend payments of 1.31 per common share, for a total of 27.1 million, compared to the period ended September 30, 2023, in which dividends of 1.14 per common share were paid for total cash dividend payments of 24.7 million. As a part of our capital allocation strategy, the Company's intention is to deliver targeted double-digit growth in the per share dividend over time. 
 
 On October 24, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.48 per common share, or 1.92 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend is payable on December 2, 2024, to shareholders of record as of November 4, 2024. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On May 2, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization of up to 1.5 billion. The authorization value excludes any excise tax that may be incurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a total of 698,855 shares were repurchased for 320.4 million, including excise tax under the 2023 program. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.1 billion remaining under the 2023 authorization. 
 
 Debt 
 
 Our long-term debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as set forth below: 
 (Millions of dollars) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 5.625 senior notes due 2027 (net of unamortized discount of 1.0 at September 30, 2024 and 1.3 at December 31, 2023)

Senior Notes 
 
 On April 25, 2017, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. ("MOUSA"), our primary operating subsidiary, issued 300 million of 5.625 Senior Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Senior Notes") under its existing shelf registration statement. The 2027 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and by the Company's subsidiaries that guarantee our Credit Facilities (as defined below). The indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company, MOUSA, and the restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments or investments, enter into transactions with affiliates or merge with or into other entities. 
 
 On September 13, 2019, MOUSA, issued 500 million of 4.75 Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Senior Notes ). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes were used to fund, in part, the tender offer and redemption of a prior note issuance. The 2029 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and by the Company's subsidiaries that guarantee our Credit Facilities. The indenture governing the 2029 Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that are essentially identical to the covenants for the 2027 Senior Notes. 
 
 On January 29, 2021, MOUSA, issued 500 million of 3.75 Senior Notes due 2031 (the "2031 Senior Notes" and, together with the 2027 Senior Notes and the 2029 Senior Notes, the "Senior Notes"). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes were used, in part, to fund the acquisition of QuickChek and other obligations related to that transaction. The 2031 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and by the Company's subsidiaries that guarantee our Credit Facilities. The indenture governing the 2031 Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that are essentially identical to the covenants for the 2027 and 2029 Senior Notes. 
 
 The Senior Notes and related guarantees rank equally with all of our and the guarantors existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively junior to our and the guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness with respect to the Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future third-party liabilities, including trade payables, of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan 
 
 Our credit agreement consists of both a cash flow revolving credit facility and a senior secured term loan. 
 
 The credit agreement provides for a senior secured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of 400 million (the Term Facility (which was borrowed in full on January 29, 2021) and revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount equal to 350 million (the Revolving Facility , and together with the Term Facility, the Credit Facilities ). The outstanding balance of the term loan was 387 million at September 30, 2024 and 390 million at December 31, 2023. The term loan is due January 2028, and we are required to make quarterly principal payments of 1 million, which began on July 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we had 41.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and 6.2 million of outstanding letters of credit (which reduces the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Facility). 
 
 Interest payable on the Term Facility is based on either: 
 
 the term secured overnight financing rate, plus the applicable Alternative Reference Rate Committee ("ARRC") recommended credit spread adjustment (the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate 
 
 or 
 
 the Alternate Base Rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the "Prime Rate", (b) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from time to time plus 0.50 per annum and (c) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.00 per annum, 
 
 plus, (A) in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR Rate borrowings, a spread of 1.75 per annum and (B) in the case of Alternate Base Rate borrowings, a spread of 0.75 per annum. 
 
 37 

Interest payable on the Revolving Facility is based on either: 
 
 the term secured overnight financing rate, plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment for all interest periods (the "Adjusted SOFR Rate"), which is subject to a 0.0 floor; 
 
 or 
 
 the Alternate Base Rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the "Prime Rate", (b) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from time to time plus 0.50 per annum and (c) the one-month Adjusted SOFR Rate plus 1.00 per annum, 
 
 plus, (A) in the case of Adjusted SOFR Rate borrowings, a spread of 1.75 to 2.25 per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio and (B) in the case of Alternate Base Rate borrowings, spreads ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio. 
 
 The Term Facility amortizes in quarterly installments, which commenced on July 1, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 per annum. Murphy USA is also required to prepay the Term Facility with a portion of its excess cash flow, a portion of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and casualty events (subject to certain reinvestment rights) and the net cash proceeds of issuances of indebtedness not permitted under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement allows Murphy USA to prepay, in whole or in part, the Term Facility outstanding thereunder, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, with prior notice but without premium or penalty other than breakage and redeployment costs. 
 
 The credit agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to make certain investments, to enter into sale-leaseback transactions, to make certain restricted payments, to enter into consolidations, mergers or sales of material assets and other fundamental changes, to transact with affiliates, to enter into agreements restricting the ability of subsidiaries to incur liens or pay dividends, or to make certain accounting changes. The Revolving Facility credit agreement also imposes total leverage ratio and secured net leverage ratio financial maintenance covenants which are tested quarterly. Pursuant to the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant, the Company must maintain a total leverage ratio of not more than 5.0 to 1.0 with an ability in certain circumstances to temporarily increase that limit to 5.5 to 1.0 and a maximum secured net leverage ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.0 with an ability in certain circumstances to temporarily increase that limit to 4.25 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. 
 
 Pursuant to the credit agreement's covenant limiting certain restricted payments, certain payments in respect of our equity interests, including dividends, when the total leverage ratio, calculated on a pro forma basis, is greater than 3.0 to 1.0, could be limited. At September 30, 2024, our total leverage ratio was 1.79 to 1.0 which meant our ability at that date to make restricted payments was not limited. If our total leverage ratio, on a pro forma basis, exceeds 3.0 to 1.0, any restricted payments made following that time until the ratio is once again, on a pro forma basis, below 3.0 to 1.0 would be limited by the covenant, which contains certain exceptions, including an ability to make restricted payments in cash in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of 117.6 million or 4.5 of consolidated net tangible assets over the life of the credit agreement. 
 
 All obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by Murphy USA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and all obligations under the credit agreement, including the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by certain assets of Murphy USA, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and the guarantors party to the guarantee and collateral agreement in respect thereof. 
 
 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 
 The following is a description of the guarantees with respect to the Senior Notes and the Credit Facilities, for which MOUSA is primary obligor, and for which the Company and certain subsidiaries provide full and unconditional guarantees on a joint and several basis. See " Debt" above for additional information concerning the Company's outstanding indebtedness, all of which is guaranteed as described below. See also Note 6 "Long Term Debt" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 
 38 

The Senior Notes and related guarantees rank equally with all of our and the guarantors existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively junior to our and the guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness with respect to the Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future third-party liabilities, including trade payables, of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. 
 
 All obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the Company and the same subsidiary guarantors that guarantee the Senior Notes. All obligations under the Credit Facilities, including the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by certain assets of the Company, MOUSA, and the other guarantors. 
 
 The combined assets, liabilities and results of operations of MOUSA and the guarantors are not materially different from corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements included herein. MOUSA is our primary operating subsidiary and generated the vast majority of our revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and accounted for the vast majority of our total assets as of September 30, 2024. In the event MOUSA itself were unable to service the Company's consolidated debt obligations, our business and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted. 
 
 Capital Spending 
 
 Capital spending and investments in our Marketing segment relate primarily to the acquisition of land and the construction of new Company stores. Our Marketing capital is also deployed to improve our existing stores, which we refer to as maintenance capital. We use maintenance capital in this business as needed to ensure reliability and continued performance of our stores. We also invest in our Corporate and other assets segment which is primarily technology related. 
 
 The following table outlines our capital spending and investments by segment for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions of dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Marketing: Company stores 111.4 53.8 267.9 160.5 Terminals 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.9 Maintenance capital 18.8 12.6 51.2 34.5 Corporate and other assets 16.2 10.4 31.0 37.3 Total 146.9 77.8 352.1 236.2 
 
 We currently expect capital expenditures for the full year 2024 to range from approximately 500 million to 525 million, including 400 million to 415 million for retail growth, approximately 65 million to 70 million for maintenance capital, with the remaining funds earmarked for other corporate investments and other strategic initiatives. See Note 18 Commitments in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

Such 
 39 

statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the Company s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual future results may differ materially from historical results or current expectations depending upon factors including, but not limited to: our ability to continue to maintain a good business relationship with Walmart; successful execution of our growth strategy, including our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from such growth initiatives, and the timely completion of construction associated with our newly planned stores which may be impacted by the financial health of third parties; our ability to effectively manage our inventory, manage disruptions in our supply chain and our ability to control costs; geopolitical events, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, that impact the supply and demand and price of crude oil; the impact of severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes; the impact of a global health pandemic and any governmental response thereto; the impact of any systems failures, cybersecurity and/or security breaches of the company or its vendor partners, including any security breach that results in theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or company information or our compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations in the event of such an incident; successful execution of our information technology strategy; reduced demand for our products due to the implementation of more stringent fuel economy and greenhouse gas reduction requirements, or increasingly widespread adoption of electric vehicle technology; future nicotine or e-cigarette legislation and any other efforts that make purchasing nicotine products more costly or difficult could hurt our revenues and impact gross margins; our ability to successfully expand our food and beverage offerings; efficient and proper allocation of our capital resources, including the timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends or levels of the Company's share repurchases, or management of operating cash; the market price of the Company's stock prevailing from time to time, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to the Company from time to time, the Company's cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions; compliance with debt covenants; availability and cost of credit; and changes in interest rates. Our SEC reports, including our most recent annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, contain other information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results and cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking information we may provide. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information or future circumstances. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of refined products (primarily gasoline and diesel) used in our operations. These fluctuations can affect our revenues and purchases, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. We make limited use of derivative instruments to manage certain risks related to commodity prices. The use of derivative instruments for risk management is covered by operating policies and is closely monitored by our middle-office function and the Company s senior management. 
 
 As described in Note 10 Financial Instruments and Risk Management in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, there were short-term commodity derivative contracts in place at September 30, 2024 to hedge the purchase price of refined products. A 10 increase or decrease in the respective benchmark price of the commodities underlying these derivative contracts would have been immaterial to the Company. Changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the changes in the value for an equivalent volume of these products. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have exposure to interest rate risks related to volatility of our floating rate term loan of 387 million and to our revolving credit facility which had 41.0 million of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024. Both of these loans are tied to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or Prime Rate which can move in either direction and cause fluctuations in our interest expense recognized in any period and in our cash flows related to interest payments made. We make limited use of interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our exposure to these rate movements. The acquisition of any interest rate derivatives is undertaken by senior management when appropriate with delegated authority from the appropriate Board level committee. A 10 increase or decrease in the interest rate would have an immaterial impact on the financial statements of the Company at September 30, 2024. 
 
 For additional information about our use of derivative instruments, see Note 14 Financial Instruments and Risk Management in our audited combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Form 10-K and Note 10 Financial Instruments and Risk Management in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

In the event a Participant s employment is terminated with the Company and all Subsidiaries prior to the end of the Performance Period for any reason other than death, Disability, or Retirement, including termination by the Company with or without Cause or the Participant s resignation for any reason, or a Participant is in the employ of a Subsidiary and the Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company (unless the Participant continues in the employ of the Company or another Subsidiary), the Participant s Award for such Performance Period shall be immediately forfeited and the Participant shall have no right to any payment thereafter provided, however , that under such circumstances, except in the event of the termination of the Participant s employment by the Company for Cause, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, pay the Participant an amount not to exceed a percentage of the amount earned according to the terms of the Award equal to the portion of the Performance Period through the Participant s termination.

EXHIBIT 10.1 

 (c) Termination for Cause. In the event a Participant s employment is terminated by the Company for Cause prior to the Payment Date for an Award, the Participant shall immediately forfeit and shall have no right to any payment thereafter with respect to such Award. 
 
 Section 8. Payment of Withholding Taxes and Other Amounts . The Company shall withhold and deduct from the payment made pursuant to an Award or from future wages of the Participant (or from other amounts that may be due and owing to the Participant from the Company or a Subsidiary), or make other arrangements for the collection of, all legally required amounts, including amounts necessary to satisfy any and all federal, state, and local withholding and employment-related tax requirements attributable to any payment made pursuant to an Award. 
 
 Section 9. Plan Amendment, Modification, and Termination . Subject to applicable law, the Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, any Award or any respective portion thereof at any time as the Committee may deem to be in the best interests of the Company, including to reduce or eliminate the compensation or other economic benefit otherwise due pursuant to an Award. 
 
 Section 10. Non-Funded, Unsecured Obligation . A Participant s only interest under the Plan shall be the right to receive a cash payment under an Award pursuant to the terms of the Award and the Plan (subject to the authority of the Committee pursuant to Section 3, Section 6, Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 of the Plan). No portion of the amount payable to Participants under the Plan shall be held by the Company or any Subsidiary in trust or escrow or any other form of asset segregation. To the extent that a Participant acquires a right to receive such a cash payment under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured, general creditor of the Company. 
 
 Section 11. Term and Duration of the Plan . The Plan was originally effective as of January 1, 2019 amended and restated (effective January 1, 2024) upon its adoption by the Board and subsequently amended and restated (effective August 14, 2024) as set forth herein upon its adoption by the Committee on August 14, 2024. The Plan, as amended and restated (effective August 14, 2024) as set forth herein, shall apply for purposes of the Plan Year which commenced on January 1, 2024 and for each subsequent Plan Year (subject to Section 9), and will remain in effect until such time as the Plan is terminated by the Committee. Any payments pursuant to Awards outstanding upon termination of the Plan may continue to be made in accordance with the terms of the Awards, subject to the authority of the Committee pursuant to Section 3 and Section 9 of the Plan. 
 
 Section 12. Section 409A of the Code . With respect to Awards subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the provisions of the Plan and any Award shall be interpreted in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan shall be operated accordingly. If any provision of the Plan or any term or condition of any Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision, term or condition shall be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this conflict. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if the Board considers a Participant to be a specified employee under Section 409A of the Code at the time of such Participant s separation from service (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), and any amount hereunder is deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, any distribution of such amount that otherwise would be made to such Participant with respect to an Award as a result of such separation from service shall not be made until the date that is six months after such separation from service, except to the extent that earlier distribution would not result in such Participant s incurring interest or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. If an Award includes a series of installment payments (within the meaning of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations), the Participant s right to such series of installment 
 7 

EXHIBIT 10.1 

 payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Plan or any Award is not warranted or guaranteed, and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by any Participant on account of non- compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 Section 13. Miscellaneous . 
 
 (a) Employment. Nothing in the Plan will interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or otherwise modify the terms and conditions of the employment of any Key Employee or Participant at any time, nor confer upon any Key Employee or Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary. 
 
 (b) Restrictions or Transfer. Except pursuant to testamentary will or the laws of descent and as otherwise expressly permitted by the Plan, no right or interest of any Participant in an Award will be assignable or transferable, or subjected to any lien, during the lifetime of the Participant, either voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise. 
 
 (c) Governing Law. The validity, construction, interpretation, administration, and effect of the Plan and any rules, regulations, and actions relating to the Plan will be governed by and construed exclusively in accordance with the internal, substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of law rules of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction. 
 
 (d) Successors. The Plan will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors of the Company and the Participants. 
 
 Section 14. Clawback. A Participant whose negligent, intentional, or gross misconduct contributes to the Company s having to restate all or a portion of its financial statements shall immediately forfeit any portion of an Award earned in the period covered by such financial statements that would not have otherwise been earned under such restated financial statements, as determined in each case, by the Committee in good faith. The Committee shall have full authority to implement any policies and procedures necessary to comply with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any rules promulgated thereunder and any other regulatory regimes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Awards granted under the Plan (including any amounts or benefits arising from such Awards) shall be subject to any clawback or recoupment arrangements or policies the Company has in place from time to time (including the Murphy USA Inc. Supplemental Compensation Recoupment Policy, the Murphy USA Inc. Financial Restatement Compensation Recoupment Policy and any other such policy adopted to comply with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and any related listing rules or regulations, including Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual), and the Committee may, to the extent permitted, and shall, to the extent required, by applicable law, stock exchange rules or Company policy or arrangement, cancel or require forfeiture or reimbursement of any Awards granted to the Participant (and any benefits derived therefrom).
