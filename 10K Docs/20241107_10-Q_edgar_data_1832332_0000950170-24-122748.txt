CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKI NG STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial condition, business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, design, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potentially, predict, project, should, will, would, or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. 
 These statements are based on certain assumptions that we have made considering our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors could affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are subject to risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following risks: 
 intense competition among home health, hospice and durable medical equipment companies; 

our ability to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources; 

the possibility that our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by public health emergencies, such as a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies; 

our ability to have services funded from third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance companies; 

changes to Medicare or Medicaid rates or methods governing Medicare or Medicaid payments, and the implementation of alternative payment models, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage, Managed Care Organization, managed Medicaid, and other forms of managed care; 

any downward pressure on reimbursement resulting from further proliferation of Medicare Advantage plans; 

our limited ability to control reimbursement rates received for our services; 

delays in collection or non-collection of our patient accounts receivable, particularly during the business integration process, or when transitioning between systems associated with clinical data collection and submission, as well as billing and collection systems; 

healthcare reform and other regulations; 

changes in the case-mix of our patients, as well as payer mix and payment methodologies; 

any reduction in net reimbursement if we do not effectively implement value-based care programs; 

our ability to attract and retain experienced employees and management personnel, and including both shortages in workforce and inflationary wage pressures; 

any failure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems or to defend against or otherwise prevent a cybersecurity attack or breach; 

our substantial indebtedness, which increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and may limit our ability to pursue strategic alternatives and react to changes in our business and industry; 

our ability to identify, acquire, successfully integrate and obtain financing for strategic and accretive acquisitions; 

risks related to legal proceedings, claims and governmental inquiries given that the nature of our business exposes us to various liability claims, which may exceed the level of our insurance coverage; and 

the other risks described under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under the heading Risk Factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 14, 2024. 

Additionally, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Considering these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q might not prove to be accurate and you should not place undue reliance upon them or otherwise rely upon them as predictions of future events. All forward-looking statements made by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. All such statements speak only as of the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

or less, the Company did not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component. Most contracts contain variable consideration; however, it is unlikely that a significant reversal of revenue will occur when the uncertainty is resolved, and therefore, the Company has included the variable consideration in the estimated transaction price. The Company determines the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payers and by implicit price concessions which are estimated based on historical collection experience. Management estimates the transaction price on a payer-specific basis given its interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms. Updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment by management.

As of September 28, 2024, the principal amount of the Second Lien Term Loan accrued interest at a rate of . Debt issuance costs related to the term loans are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt. The balance for debt issuance costs related to the term loans as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The Company recognized interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs of million and million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Issued letters of credit as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively. There were swingline loans outstanding as of September 28, 2024 or December 30, 2023. Borrowing capacity under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility was approximately million as of September 28, 2024 and million as of December 30, 2023. Available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a maintenance leverage covenant that becomes effective if more than of the total commitment is utilized . The fair value of the Company's long-term obligations was estimated using market-observable inputs from the Company s comparable peers with public debt, including quoted prices in active markets, which are considered Level 2 inputs. The aggregate fair value of the Company's long-term obligations was million at September 28, 2024. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions under the foregoing instruments at September 28, 2024. See Note 14 - Subsequent Event for disclosure of subsequent amendments to the Revolving Credit Facility. 

 (as amended, the Securitization Facility . On May 31, 2024, the Company amended the Securitization Facility to increase the maximum amount available thereunder from million to million, subject to certain borrowing base requirements . The Company incurred debt issuance costs of million in connection with the Securitization Facility, which were capitalized and included in other long-term assets. The Company recognized interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs of million and million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Pursuant to two separate sale agreements, each of which is among Aveanna Healthcare, LLC, as initial servicer, certain of the Company's subsidiaries and the special purpose entity, the subsidiaries sold substantially all of their existing and future accounts receivable balances to the special purpose entity. The special purpose entity uses the accounts receivable balances to collateralize loans made under the Securitization Facility. The Company retains the responsibility of servicing the accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral under the Securitization Facility and provides a performance guaranty. The outstanding balance under the Securitization Facility was million and million at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The balance accrues interest at a rate equal to the SOFR rate, plus a CSA, plus an applicable margin . The interest rate under the Securitization Facility was at September 28, 2024. The Securitization Facility is accounted for as a collateralized financing activity, rather than a sale of assets; therefore: (i) accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral are presented as assets and the borrowings are presented as liabilities in the interim unaudited consolidated balance sheets; (ii) the consolidated statements of operations reflect the interest expense associated with the collateralized borrowings; and (iii) receipts from customers related to the underlying accounts receivable are reflected as operating cash flows and borrowings and repayments under the collateralized loans are reflected as financing cash flows within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Securitization Facility is included within current liabilities on the interim unaudited

The fair values of the interest rate swap and cap agreements are based on the estimated net proceeds or costs to settle the transactions as of the respective balance sheet dates. The valuations are based on commercially reasonable industry and market practices for valuing similar financial instruments. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments for further details on the Company s interest rate swap and cap agreements. 

 interest rate swap agreements intended to limit its exposure to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt. These swaps expire on . Prior to the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the interest rate swap agreements paid a fixed rate of and received the one-month LIBOR rate, subject to a floor. During the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the Company amended its interest rate swap agreements to change the benchmark rate under the agreements from LIBOR to SOFR. Since July 1, 2023, the interest rate swap agreements have paid a fixed rate of and received the one-month SOFR rate, subject to a floor. The aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swaps remained unchanged at million at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was million at September 28, 2024 and million at December 30, 2023 and is included in other long-term assets in the interim unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to these agreements and records all mark-to-market adjustments directly to other (expense) income in the consolidated statements of operations, which are included within cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The net settlements incurred with swap counterparties under the swap agreements are recognized through cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to an other-than-insignificant financing element on the interest rate swaps.

 Overview 
 We are a leading, diversified home care platform focused on providing care to medically complex, high-cost patient populations. We directly address the most pressing challenges facing the U.S. healthcare system by providing safe, high-quality care in the home, the lower cost care setting preferred by patients. Our patient-centered care delivery platform is designed to improve the quality of care our patients receive, which allows them to remain in their homes and minimizes the overutilization of high-cost care settings such as hospitals. Our clinical model is led by our caregivers, primarily skilled nurses, who provide specialized care to address the complex needs of each patient we serve across the full range of patient populations: newborns, children, adults and seniors. We have invested significantly in our platform to bring together best-in-class talent at all levels of the organization and support such talent with industry leading training, clinical programs, infrastructure and technology-enabled systems, which are increasingly essential in an evolving healthcare industry. We believe our platform creates sustainable competitive advantages that support our ability to continue driving rapid growth, both organically and through acquisitions, and positions us as the partner of choice for the patients we serve. 
 Segments 
 We deliver our services to patients through three segments: Private Duty Services PDS Home Health Hospice HHH and Medical Solutions MS ).

PDS Segment 
 Private Duty Services predominantly includes private duty nursing PDN services, as well as pediatric therapy services. Our PDN patients typically enter our service as children, as our most significant referral sources for new patients are children s hospitals. It is common for our PDN patients to continue to receive our services into adulthood, as approximately 30 of our PDN patients are over the age of 18. 
 Our PDN services involve the provision of clinical and non-clinical hourly care to patients in their homes, which is the preferred setting for patient care. PDN services typically last four to 24 hours a day, provided by our registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, home health aides, and other non-clinical caregivers who are focused on providing high-quality short-term and long-term clinical care to medically fragile children and adults with a wide variety of serious illnesses and conditions. Patients who typically qualify for our PDN services include those with the following conditions: 
 Tracheotomies or ventilator dependence; 

Dependence on continuous nutritional feeding through a G-tube or NG-tube 

Dependence on intravenous nutrition; 

Oxygen-dependence in conjunction with other medical needs; and 

Complex medical needs such as frequent seizures. 

Our PDN services include: 
 In-home skilled nursing services to medically fragile children and adults; 

Nursing services in school settings in which our caregivers accompany patients to school; 

Services to patients in our Pediatric Day Healthcare Centers PDHC and 

Non-clinical care, including programs such as employer of record support services and personal care services. 

Through our pediatric therapy services, we provide a valuable multidisciplinary approach that we believe serves all of a child s therapy needs. We provide both in-clinic and home-based therapy services to our patients. Our therapy services include physical, occupational and speech services. We regularly collaborate with physicians and other community healthcare providers, which allows us to provide more comprehensive care. 
 HHH Segment 
 Our Home Health and Hospice segment predominantly includes home health services, as well as hospice and specialty program services. Our HHH patients typically enter our service as seniors, and our most significant referral sources for new patients are hospitals, physicians and long-term care facilities. 
 Our home health services involve the provision of in-home services to our patients by our clinicians which may include nurses, therapists, social workers and home health aides. Our caregivers work with our patients physicians to deliver a personalized plan of care to our patients in their homes. Home healthcare can help our patients recover after a hospitalization or surgery and assist patients in managing chronic illnesses. We also help our patients manage their medications. Through our care, we help our patients recover more fully in the comfort of their own homes, while remaining as independent as possible. Our home health services include: in-home skilled nursing services; physical, occupational and speech therapy; medical social services and aide services. 
 Our hospice services invo lve a supportive philosophy and concept of care for those nearing the end of life. Our hospice care is a positive, empowering form of care designed to provide comfort and support to our patients and their families when a life-limiting illness no longer responds to cure-oriented treatments. The goal of hospice is to neither prolong life nor hasten death, but to help our patients live as dignified and pain-free as possible. Our hospice care is provided by a team of specially trained professionals in a variety of living situations, including at home, at the hospital, a nursing home, or an assisted living facility. 
 MS Segment 
 Through our Medical Solutions segment, we offer a comprehensive line of enteral nutrition supplies and other products to adults and children, delivered on a periodic or as-needed basis. We provide our patients with access to one of the largest selections of enteral formulas, supplies and pumps in our industry, with more than 300 nutritional formulas available. Our registered nurses, registered dietitians and customer service technicians support our patients 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, in-hospital, at-home, or remotely to help ensure that our patients have the best nutrition assessments, change order reviews and formula selection expertise. 
 Recent Developments

CMS Final Rule: Ensuring Access to Medicaid Services 
 
 On April 22, 2024, the U.S. Department of Health Human Services through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") released the Ensuring Access to Medicaid Services final rule (CMS-2442-F). The final rule has a stated goal of improving access to services for Medicaid beneficiaries. As part of this rule, CMS requires that state Medicaid departments provide assurances that a minimum of 80 of Medicaid payments for personal care and similar services be spent on compensation to and clinical supervision of the direct care workers providing these services. While the effective date of the final rule was July 9, 2024, the states are allowed six years to implement the provisions regarding the 80 minimum payment. The ultimate impact of the final rule is not expected to have a material impact to our results of operations. 
 Important Operating Metrics 
 We review the following important metrics on a segment basis and not on a consolidated basis: 
 PDS and MS Segment Operating Metrics 
 Volume 
 
 Volume represents PDS hours of care provided and MS unique patients served, which is how we measure the amount of our patient services provided. We review the number of hours of PDS care provided on a weekly basis and the number of MS unique patients served on a weekly basis. We believe volume is an important metric because it helps us understand how the Company is growing in each of these segments through strategic planning and acquisitions. We also use this metric to inform strategic decision making in determining opportunities for growth. 
 Revenue Rate 
 For our PDS and MS segments, revenue rate is calculated as revenue divided by PDS hours of care provided or the number of MS unique patients served, respectively. We believe revenue rate is an important metric because it represents the amount of revenue we receive per PDS hour of patient service or per individual MS patient transaction and helps management assess the amount of fees that we are able to bill for our services. Management uses this metric to assess how effectively we optimize reimbursement rates. 
 Cost of Revenue Rate 
 For our PDS and MS segments, cost of revenue rate is calculated as cost of revenue divided by PDS hours of care provided or the number of MS unique patients served, respectively. We believe cost of revenue rate is an important metric because it helps us understand the cost per PDS hour of patient service or per individual MS patient transaction. Management uses this metric to understand how effectively we manage labor and product costs. 
 Spread Rate 
 
 For our PDS and MS segments, spread rate represents the difference between the respective revenue rates and cost of revenue rates. Spread rate is an important metric because it helps us better understand the margins being recognized per PDS hour of patient service or per individual MS patient transaction. Management uses this metric to assess how successful we have been in optimizing reimbursement rates, managing labor and product costs, and assessing opportunities for growth. 
 HHH Segment Operating Metrics 
 Home Health Total Admissions and Home Health Episodic Admissions 
 Home health total admissions represents the number of new patients who have begun receiving services. We review the number of home health admissions on a daily basis as we believe it is a leading indicator of our growth. We measure home health admissions by 
 19 

reimbursement structure, separating them into home health episodic admissions and fee-for-service admissions (other admissions), which allows us to better understand the payor mix of our home health business. 
 Home Health Total Episodes 
 Home health total episodes represents the number of episodic admissions and episodic recertifications to capture patients who have either started to receive services or have been recertified for another episode of care. Management reviews home health total episodes on a monthly basis as to understand the volume of patients who were authorized to receive care during the month. 
 Home Health Revenue Per Completed Episode 
 Home health revenue per completed episode is calculated by dividing total payments received from completed episodes by the number of completed episodes during the period. Episodic payments are determined by multiple factors including type of referral source, patient diagnoses, and utilization. Management tracks home health revenue per completed episode over time to evaluate both the clinical and financial profile of the business in a single metric.

The following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the foregoing tables summarizing our consolidated results of operations and key performance measures, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 . 
 
 Summary Operating Results 
 
 Operating Income (Loss) 
 Operating income was 34.0 million, or 6.7 of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to operating loss of 76.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 110.4 million. 
 
 Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was positively impacted by an increase of 15.3 million, or 27.1 , in Field contribution, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The 15.3 million increase in Field contribution resulted from a 31.0 million, or 6.5 , increase in consolidated revenue and a 2.2 increase in our Field contribution margin to 14.0 for the third quarter of 2024 from 11.8 for the third quarter of 2023. The primary driver of our higher Field contribution margin over the comparable quarter was an increase in gross margin percentage of 0.6 , along with a 1.7 decrease in branch and regional administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to 17.3 for the third quarter of 2024 from 19.0 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 The following items primarily contributed to the 110.4 million increase in operating income over the comparable third quarter period: 
 
 the previously discussed 15.3 million increase in Field contribution; and 

a 105.1 million decrease in goodwill impairment expense; offset by 

a 4.4 million increase in corporate expenses; and 

a 6.2 million increase in other operating expense (income). 

Net Loss 
 
 Net loss for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 was 42.8 million, as compared to net loss of 102.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 . The 59.5 million decrease in net loss was primarily driven by the following: 
 
 the previously discussed 110.4 million increase in operating income; offset by 

an aggregate 36.4 million decrease in valuation gains on interest rate derivatives and net settlements received from interest rate derivative counterparties over the comparable quarter; and 

a 14.9 million increase in tax expense. 

Revenue 
 
 Revenue was 509.0 million for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to 478.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of 31.0 million, or 6.5 . This increase resulted from the following segment activity: 
 
 a 24.8 million, or 6.4 , increase in PDS revenue; 

a 1.2 million, or 2.2 , increase in HHH revenue; and 

a 5.1 million, or 12.6 , increase in MS revenue. 

Our PDS segment revenue growth of 24.8 million, or 6.4 , for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 was attributable to a 3.8 increase in volume and a 2.6 increase in revenue rate. The 3.8 increase in volume was primarily attributable to growth in demand for non-clinical services. 
 The 2.6 increase in PDS revenue rate for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, resulted primarily from reimbursement rate increases issued by various state Medicaid programs and Managed Medicaid payers and increases in value-based payments, offset by increases in implicit price concessions. 
 22 

Our HHH segment revenue increase of 1.2 million, or 2.2 , for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, resulted primarily from an increase in home health total episodes over the comparable period and an increase in home health revenue per completed episode due to improvements in home health episodic mix. 
 The 5.1 million, or 12.6 , increase in MS segment revenue for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, was attributable to both an 8.1 increase in revenue rate and volume growth of 4.5 over the comparable period . 
 
 Cost of Revenue, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, was 349.3 million for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to 330.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of 18.6 million, or 5.6 . This increase resulted from the following segment activity: 
 
 a 19.4 million, or 6.9 , increase in PDS cost of revenue; 

a 2.6 million, or 9.6 , decrease in HHH cost of revenue; and 

a 1.8 million, or 7.8 , increase in MS cost of revenue. 

The 6.9 increase in PDS cost of revenue for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 resulted from the previously described 3.8 increase in PDS volume combined with a 3.1 increase in PDS cost of revenue rate. The 3.1 increase in cost of revenue rate primarily resulted from higher caregiver labor costs, including the pass-through of reimbursement rate increases. 
 The 9.6 decrease in HHH cost of revenue for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 was driven primarily by a decline in HHH non-episodic volumes and improvements in HHH caregiver utilization. 
 The 7.8 increase in MS cost of revenue for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 was driven by the previously described 4.5 growth in MS volumes and a 3.3 increase in cost of revenue rate . 
 
 Gross Margin and Gross Margin Percentage 
 
 Gross margin was 159.7 million, or 31.4 of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to 147.3 million, or 30.8 of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 . Gross margin increased 12.4 million, or 8.4 , from the comparable prior year quarter. The 0.6 increase in gross margin percentage for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 resulted from the combined changes in our revenue rates and cost of revenue rates in each of our segments, which we refer to as the change in our spread rate, as follows: 
 
 a 1.3 increase in PDS spread rate from 10.35 to 10.48 driven by the 2.6 increase in PDS revenue rate, net of the 3.1 increase in PDS cost of revenue rate; 

a 14.3 increase in MS spread rate from 197.84 to 224.79 driven by the 8.1 in crease in MS revenue rate, net of the 3.3 increase in MS cost of revenue rate; and 

our HHH segment, in which gross margin percentage increased by 6.0 . 

Branch and Regional Administrative Expenses 
 Branch and regional administrative expenses were 88.2 million, or 17.3 of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 91.0 million, or 19.0 of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.8 million, or 3.1 . 
 The 3.1 decrease in branch and regional administrative expenses for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the positive effects of restructuring portions of our branch and regional operating structure, which resulted in the overall 1.7 decrease in branch and regional administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Field Contribution and Field Contribution Margin 
 
 Field contribution was 71.5 million, or 14.0 of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to 56.3 million, or 11.8 of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 . Field contribution increased 15.3 million, or 27.1 , for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 . The 2.2 increase in Field contribution margin for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 resulted from the following: 
 23 

a 0.6 increase in gross margin percentage in the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 ; and 

a 1.7 decrease in branch and regional administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 . 

Field contribution and Field contribution margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 
 Corporate Expenses 
 
 Corporate expenses as a percentage of revenue for the three-month periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:

The 4.4 million, or 16.2 , increase in corporate expenses resulted primarily from higher compensation and benefits costs, non-cash share-based compensation, and professional services. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 Goodwill impairment was 105.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. As a result of anticipated volume not being actualized to forecasted levels in the reporting unit within our HHH segment, primarily related to continued challenges in the labor markets, we recorded a 105.1 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the three months ended September 30, 2023. There was no goodwill impairment charge recorded during the three-month period ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization was 2.6 million for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to 3.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 , a decrease of 0.4 million, or 12.7 . The 0.4 million decrease primarily resulted from improved capital asset management. 
 
 Other Operating Expense (Income) 
 
 Other operating expense was 2.9 million for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to other operating income of 3.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in other operating income of 6.2 million. The 6.2 million decrease primarily resulted from a favorable 5.1 million non-cash gain on the acquisition of certain business licenses and other net assets recorded during the third quarter of 2023, and a 1.1 million increase in license impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense, net of Interest Income 
 
 Interest expense, net of interest income was 39.1 million for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to 39.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 , a decrease of 0.4 million, or 1.0 . The decrease was primarily driven by a lower principal balance on the 2021 Extended Term Loan (as described in Note 4 to our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (our Quarterly Financial Statements )) and the September 2024 U.S. 
 24 

federal funds rate cut, partially offset by higher borrowing under our Securitization Facility (as defined in Note 5 to our Quarterly Financial Statements). See further analysis under Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 
 Other expense was 22.2 million for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to other income of 14.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 , a decrease to other income of 36.4 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a 36.3 million decrease in non-cash valuation gains on interest rate derivatives resulting from changes in market expectations of future interest rates as of the comparable quarter-end valuation dates. Details of other (expense) income included the following:

Income Taxes 
 
 We incurred income tax expense of 15.5 million for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to income tax expense of 0.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This increase in tax expense was primarily driven by the changes in federal and state valuation allowances, and changes to federal and state current tax expense due to certain non-deductible expenses, most notably interest expense.

The following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the foregoing tables summarizing our consolidated results of operations and key performance measures, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 . 
 
 Summary Operating Results 
 
 Operating Income (Loss) 
 Operating income was 94.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to operating loss of 21.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 115.2 million, or 543.0 . 
 
 Operating income for the nine-month period of 2024 was positively impacted by an increase of 26.7 million, or 15.5 , in Field contribution as compared to the nine-month period of 2023. The 26.7 million increase in Field contribution resulted from a 88.3 million, or 6.2 , increase in consolidated revenue and a 1.1 increase in our Field contribution margin to 13.3 for the nine-month period of 2024 from 12.2 for the nine-month period of 2023. The primary driver of our higher Field contribution margin year over year was a 1.7 decrease in branch and regional administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to 17.6 for the nine-month period of 2024 from 19.3 for the nine-month period of 2023 partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentage of 0.8 over the comparable period. 
 The overall 115.2 million increase in operating income over the comparable periods primarily consists of: 
 
 the previously discussed 26.7 million increase in Field contribution; 

a 105.1 million decrease in goodwill impairment expense; and 

a 2.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization; offset by 

a 7.2 million increase in corporate expenses; and 

a 11.9 million decrease in other operating income. 

Net Loss 
 
 Net loss for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 was 40.1 million, as compared to net loss of 108.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The 68.7 million decrease in net loss was primarily driven by the following: 
 
 the previously discussed 115.2 million increase in operating income; offset by 

an aggregate 24.8 million decrease in valuation gains on interest rate derivatives, and increases in net settlements received from interest rate derivative counterparties over the comparable period; and 

a 4.9 million increase in interest expense, net of interest income; and 

a 16.8 million increase in income tax expense. 

Revenue 
 
 Revenue was 1,504.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 1,416.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 88.3 million, or 6.2 . This increase resulted from the following segment activity: 
 
 a 77.1 million, or 6.8 , increase in PDS revenue; 

a 1.1 million, or 0.7 , decrease in HHH revenue; and 

a 12.4 million, or 10.6 , increase in MS revenue. 

Our PDS segment revenue growth of 77.1 million, or 6.8 , for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 was attributable to a 4.5 increase in volume and a 2.3 increase in revenue rate. The 4.5 increase in volume was primarily attributable to growth in demand for non-clinical services. 
 27 

The 2.3 increase in PDS revenue rate for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, resulted primarily from reimbursement rate increases issued by various state Medicaid programs and Managed Medicaid payers and increases in value-based payments, offset by increases in implicit price concessions. 
 Our HHH segment revenue decrease of 1.1 million, or 0.7 , for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 resulted primarily from a decline in non-episodic volumes over the comparable period. While home health total admissions declined 8.1 over the comparable period, total segment revenue declined by a lower rate primarily due to improvements in home health episodic mix. 
 The 12.4 million, or 10.6 , increase in MS segment revenue for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, was attributable to volume growth of 7.8 combined with a 2.8 increase in revenue rate over the comparable period . 
 
 Cost of Revenue, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, was 1,040.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 969.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 71.4 million, or 7.4 . This increase resulted from the following segment activity: 
 
 a 76.4 million, or 9.4 , increase in PDS cost of revenue; 

a 11.4 million, or 13.0 , decrease in HHH cost of revenue; and 

a 6.4 million, or 9.6 , increase in MS cost of revenue. 

The 9.4 increase in PDS cost of revenue for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 resulted from the previously described 4.5 increase in PDS volume combined with a 4.9 increase in PDS cost of revenue rate. The 4.9 increase in cost of revenue rate primarily resulted from higher caregiver labor costs, including the pass-through of reimbursement rate increases. The prior year period included 5.0 million lower general and professional liability expense associated with certain accrued legal settlements. 
 The 13.0 decrease in HHH cost of revenue for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 was driven primarily by a decline in HHH non-episodic volumes and improvements in HHH caregiver utilization. 
 The 9.6 increase in MS cost of revenue for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 was driven by the previously described 7.8 growth in MS volumes and a 1.8 increase in cost of revenue rate . 
 
 Gross Margin and Gross Margin Percentage 
 
 Gross margin was 463.8 million, or 30.8 of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 447.0 million, or 31.6 of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin increased 16.8 million, or 3.8 , from the comparable prior year quarter. The 0.8 decrease in gross margin percentage for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 resulted from the combined changes in our revenue rates and cost of revenue rates in each of our segments, which we refer to as the change in our spread rate, as follows: 
 
 a 4.3 decrease in PDS spread rate from 10.77 to 10.33 driven by the 2.3 increase in PDS revenue rate, net of the 4.9 increase in PDS cost of revenue rate; 

a 4.2 increase in MS spread rate from 191.88 to 199.36 driven by the 2.8 increase in MS revenue rate, net of the 1.8 increase in MS cost of revenue rate; and 

our HHH segment, in which gross margin percentage increased by 6.6 . 

Branch and Regional Administrative Expenses 
 Branch and regional administrative expenses were 264.1 million, or 17.6 of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 274.0 million, or 19.3 of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 9.9 million, or 3.6 . 
 The 3.6 decrease in branch and regional administrative expenses for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the positive effects of restructuring portions of our branch and regional operating structure, which resulted in the overall 1.7 decrease in branch and regional administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 28 

Field Contribution and Field Contribution Margin 
 
 Field contribution was 199.8 million, or 13.3 of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 173.0 million, or 12.2 of revenue, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Field contribution increased 26.7 million, or 15.5 , for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The 1.1 increase in Field contribution margin for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 resulted from the following: 
 
 a 1.7 decrease in branch and regional administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023; offset by 

a 0.8 decrease in gross margin percentage in the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Field contribution and Field contribution margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 
 Corporate Expenses 
 
 Corporate expenses as a percentage of revenue for the nine-month periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:

The 7.2 million, or 8.6 , increase in corporate expenses resulted primarily from higher compensation and benefits, higher non-cash share-based compensation costs, and higher professional services. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 Goodwill impairment was 105.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. As a result of anticipated volume not being actualized to forecasted levels in the reporting unit within our HHH segment, primarily related to continued challenges in the labor markets, we recorded a 105.1 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. There was no goodwill impairment charge recorded during the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization was 8.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 10.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.2 million, or 20.6 . The 2.2 million decrease primarily resulted from improved capital asset management. 
 
 Other Operating Expense (Income) 
 
 Other operating expense was 5.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to other operating income of 6.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in other operating income of 11.9 million. The 11.9 million decrease primarily resulted from impairment of a certain facility lease asset recorded in the current year nine-month period, and both a favorable 3.6 million acquisition-related legal settlement and a favorable 5.1 million non-cash gain on the acquisition of certain business licenses and other net assets recorded in the prior year nine-month period. 
 
 29 

Interest Expense, net of Interest Income 
 
 Interest expense, net of interest income was 118.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 113.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.9 million, or 4.3 . The increase was primarily driven by increased borrowing under our Securitization Facility and a higher U.S. federal funds rate during the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. See further analysis under Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Other income was 2.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to other income of 27.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. We realized a 29.5 million decrease in non-cash valuation gains on interest rate derivatives resulting from changes in market expectations of future interest rates as of the comparable valuation dates, offset by a 4.8 million improvement in net settlements with interest rate derivative counterparties as interest rates increased compared to the prior year period due to higher market interest rates. Details of other income included the following:

Income Taxes 
 
 We incurred income tax expense of 18.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 , as compared to income tax expense of 1.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This increase in tax expense was primarily driven by the changes to federal and state current tax expense and the changes in federal and state valuation allowances due to certain non-deductible expenses, most notably interest expense. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), which we have discussed above, we also evaluate our financial performance using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Field contribution and Field contribution margin. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as net income or loss. Rather, we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our performance. We define EBITDA as net income or loss before interest expense, net; income tax expense; and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for the impact of certain other items that are either non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash, unusual, or items deemed by management to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations, including impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; non-cash, share-based compensation; loss on extinguishment of debt; fees related to debt modifications; the effect of interest rate derivatives; acquisition-related and integration costs; legal costs and settlements associated with acquisition matters; restructuring costs; other legal matters; other system transition costs, professional fees; and other costs including gains and losses on acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. As non-GAAP financial measures, our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from similarly termed non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, making comparisons with other companies on the basis of this measure impracticable. 
 Management believes our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance. In determining which adjustments are made to arrive at EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, management considers both (1) certain non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash or unusual items, which can vary significantly from year to year, as well as (2) certain other items that may be recurring, frequent, or settled in cash but which management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess operating performance and make business decisions. 
 We have incurred substantial acquisition-related costs and integration costs. The underlying acquisition activities take place over a defined timeframe, have distinct project timelines and are incremental to activities and costs that arise in the ordinary course of our 
 30 

business. Therefore, we believe it is important to exclude these costs from our Adjusted EBITDA because it provides management a normalized view of our core, ongoing operations after integrating our acquired companies, which is an important measure in assessing our performance. 
 Given our determination of adjustments in arriving at our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, these non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to net income or loss, revenue, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Field Contribution and Field Contribution Margin 
 Field contribution and Field contribution margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as gross margin and gross margin percentage. Rather, we present Field contribution and Field contribution margin as supplemental measures of our performance. We define Field contribution as gross margin less branch and regional administrative expenses. Field contribution margin is Field contribution as a percentage of revenue. As non-GAAP financial measures, our computations of Field contribution and Field contribution margin may vary from similarly termed non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, making comparisons with other companies on the basis of these measures impracticable. 
 Field contribution and Field contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to gross margin, gross margin percentage, net income or loss, revenue, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Management believes Field contribution and Field contribution margin are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance and evaluating trends in our branch and regional results, which can vary from year to year. We use Field contribution and Field contribution margin to make business decisions and assess the operating performance and results delivered by our core field operations, prior to corporate and other costs not directly related to our field operations. These metrics are also important because they guide us in determining whether or not our branch and regional administrative expenses are appropriately sized to support our caregivers 
 32 

and direct patient care operations. Additionally, Field contribution and Field contribution margin determine how effective we are in managing our field supervisory and administrative costs associated with supporting our provision of services and sale of products.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our principal sources of cash have historically been from cash provided by operating activities. Our principal source of liquidity in addition to cash provided by operating activities, or when we have used net cash in our operating activities, has historically been from proceeds from our credit facilities and issuances of common stock. 
 Our principal uses of cash and liquidity have historically been for acquisitions, interest and principal payments under our credit facilities, payments under our interest rate derivatives, and financing of working capital. Payment of interest and related fees under our credit facilities is currently the most significant use of our operating cash flow. Our goal is to use cashflow provided by operations primarily as a source of cash to supplement the purchase price for acquisitions. 
 In September 2023, in response to a 7.9 million arbitration award rendered against us in connection with a civil litigation matter, we promptly obtained a 9.1 million appellate bond with the trial court. The 9.1 million appellate bond was collateralized with letters of credit. While we intend to avail ourselves of all appellate options, the resolution of this matter could reduce the cash available to us for general working capital purposes. 
 For additional information with respect to the foregoing litigation matters, please see "Litigation and Other Current Liabilities" set forth in Note 10 to our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 At September 28, 2024 we had 78.5 million in cash on hand, 37.9 million available to us under our Securitization Facility and approximately 168.2 million of borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below, and prior to giving effect to the amendment to such facility on September 30, 2024 that, among other things, reduced the maximum borrowing capacity from 200.0 million to 170.3 million). Available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a maintenance leverage covenant that becomes effective if more than 30 of the total commitment is utilized, subject to a 15.0 million carve-out for letters of credit . We believe that our operating cash flows, available cash on hand, and availability under our Securitization Facility and Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict, including the size, timing and structure of any future acquisitions, future capital investments and future results of operations. We cannot assure you that cash provided by operating activities or cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.

Operating Activities 
 The primary sources or uses of our operating cash flow are operating income or operating losses, as well as any other significant non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation, and cash paid for interest. The timing of collections of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable, other accrued liabilities and accrued payroll can also impact and cause fluctuations in our operating cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by 6.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: 
 the provision of cash associated with operating assets and liabilities over the comparable period, including the timing of payroll and incentive settlements, the prior year benefit of deferring of one month of interest under our term loans, which we had previously paid on a monthly basis, and the prior year benefit of a one-time deferral of cash payments under employee medical plans as we transitioned to a self-insured plan; partially offset by 

improvements in operating income over the prior year period. 

Days Sales Outstanding DSO 
 
 DSO provides us with a gauge to measure the timing of cash collections against accounts receivable and related revenue. DSO is derived by dividing our average patient accounts receivable for the fiscal period by our average daily revenue for the fiscal period. The collection cycle for our HHH segment is generally longer than that of our PDS segment, primarily due to longer billing cycles for HHH, which is generally billed in thirty day increments. The following table presents our trailing five quarter DSO for the periods presented below:

Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 4.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 7.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the 2.4 million decrease in cash used in the current period was the prior year purchase of certificates of need of 2.7 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 9.5 million, from 10.6 million net cash provided for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 20.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024. The 9.5 million increase was primarily attributable to the timing of both payments on term loans and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan as well as lower notes payable borrowings during the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024. 
 Indebtedness 
 We typically incur term loan indebtedness to finance our acquisitions, and we borrow under our Securitization Facility and Revolving Credit Facility from time to time for working capital purposes, as well as to finance acquisitions, as needed. The following table presents our current and long-term obligations under our credit facilities as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, as well as related interest expense for the nine-month periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively:

We were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions related to existing credit facilities at September 28, 2024. 
 On September 30, 2024, the we amended the terms of our revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 4 of our Quarterly Financial Statements) to extend the Revolving Credit Facility s maturity date from April 29, 2026 to the earlier of (i) April 15, 2028 and (ii) May 1, 2026 if by such date the Securitization Facility has not been renewed or replaced or paid-off, in each case, in full, with a maturity date that is April 15, 2028, or later. Additionally, such amendment immediately reduced the maximum borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from 200.0 million to 170.3 million through April 29, 2026, and then subsequently reduces availability to 148.9 million from April 29, 2026 through the amended maturity date. 
 
 On May 31, 2024, we amended our Securitization Facility, which matures on July 31, 2026, to increase the borrowing capacity to 225.0 million, subject to certain borrowing base requirements. Further, this amendment revised the Securitization Facility's applicable margin on the borrowing rate to 3.15 , with all other terms remaining the same. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our contractual obligations consist primarily of long-term debt obligations, interest payments, operating and financing leases. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital needs. As of September 28, 2024, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 for accounting policies and related estimates we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements, financial condition and results of operations and which require complex management judgment and assumptions, or involve uncertainties. These critical accounting estimates include patient services and product revenue; business combinations; goodwill; and insurance reserves. There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates or their application since the date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not required for a smaller reporting company. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, solely as a result of a previously reported material weakness. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, there were no changes to previously issued financial statements, and management did not identify any misstatements in our financial statements as a result of this material weakness. Our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer believe that the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a 
 35 

timely basis. Specifically, the material weakness is due to control deficiencies related to the overall information technology general controls ("ITGCs") for both user access and program change management for systems supporting the Company's internal control processes and controls. Our business process controls (automated and manual) were also deemed ineffective because they are adversely impacted by these ineffective ITGCs. Additionally, we did not fully design and implement business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on one of the revenue systems in the Private Duty Services segment which has been replaced in fiscal 2024. 
 
 As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, management is in the process of implementing its remediation plan. Our remediation efforts include: (i) implementation of a new revenue system in Q1 2024; (ii) improvements to our ITGCs in the areas of user access and program change-management for systems supporting the Company s internal control processes to ensure that internal controls are designed and operating effectively; and (iii) training and educating the control owners on ITGC policies concerning the principles and requirements of each control, with a focus on those related to user access and change-management over IT systems impacting financial reporting. We believe that these actions will remediate the foregoing material weakness. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the actions intended to remediate the material weakness as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that have occurred during the three-month period ended September 28, 2024, that have materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to materially impact, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies and procedures.
