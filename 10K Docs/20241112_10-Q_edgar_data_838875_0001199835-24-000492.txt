operating segments, Direct Sales and Distributor Sales, based upon their different distribution channels,
margins and selling strategies. Direct Sales include retail sales in the tasting rooms, wine club sales, internet sales, on-site events,
kitchen and catering sales and other sales made directly to the consumer without the use of an intermediary, including sales of bulk
wine or grapes. Distributor Sales include all sales through a third party where prices are given at a wholesale rate. 

The
two segments reflect how the Company s operations are evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial
reporting. The Company evaluates performance based on the gross profit of the respective business segments. Selling expenses that can
be directly attributable to the segment, including depreciation of segment specific assets, are included, however, centralized selling
expenses and general and administrative expenses are not allocated between operating segments. Therefore, net income (loss) information
for the respective segments is not available. Discrete financial information related to segment assets, other than segment specific depreciation
associated with selling, is not available and that information continues to be aggregated.

Shareholders
have the option to receive dividends as cash or as a gift card for purchasing Company products. The amount of unused dividend gift cards
at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively, and is recorded as unearned revenue on the balance
sheets. Revenue from gift cards is recognized when the gift card is redeemed by a customer. When the likelihood of a gift card being
redeemed by a customer is determined to be remote and the Company expects to be entitled to the breakage, then the value of the unredeemed
gift card is recognized as revenue. We determine the gift card breakage rate based upon Company-specific historical redemption patterns.
To date we have determined that no breakage should be recognized related to our gift cards. 

Dividends
accrued but not paid will be added to the liquidation preference of the stock until the dividend is declared and paid. At any time after
June 1, 2021, the Company has the option, but not the obligation, to redeem all of the outstanding preferred stock in an amount equal
to the original issue price plus accrued but unpaid dividends and a redemption premium equal to 3 of the original issue price.

ITEM
2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

As
used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we, us, our and the Company 
refer to Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc. 

Forward
Looking Statements 

This
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Form 10-Q contain
forward looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). .
These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about
the Company s business, and beliefs and assumptions made by management. Words such as expects, anticipates, 
 intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates , predicts, 
 potential, should, or will or the negative thereof and variations of such words and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from
what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: availability
of financing for growth, availability of adequate supply of high quality grapes, successful performance of internal operations, impact
of competition, changes in wine broker or distributor relations or performance, impact of possible adverse weather conditions, impact
of reduction in grape quality or supply due to disease or smoke from forest fires, changes in consumer spending, and the reduction in
consumer demand for premium wines. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth
rates, and general domestic economic conditions. Many of these risks as well as other risks that may have a material adverse impact on
our operations and business, are identified in Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in the Company s other Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports. The
forward-looking statements in this report are made as of the date hereof, and, except as otherwise required by law, the Company disclaims
any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why the actual results could
differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
foregoing discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed financial statements
requires the Company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates,
including those related to revenue recognition, collection of accounts receivable, valuation of inventories, and amortization of vineyard
development costs. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A description
of the Company s critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates that affect the preparation of the Company s
financial statements is set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Such policies
were unchanged during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Company, one of the largest wine producers in Oregon by volume, believes its success is dependent upon its ability to: (1) grow and purchase
high quality vinifera wine grapes; (2) vinify the grapes into premium, super premium and ultra-premium wine; (3) achieve significant
brand recognition for its wines, first in Oregon, and then nationally and internationally; (4) effectively distribute and sell its products
nationally; and (5) continue to build on its base of direct to consumer sales. 

14 

The
Company s goal is to continue to build on a reputation for producing some of Oregon s finest, most sought-after wines. The
Company has focused on positioning itself for strategic growth through property purchases, property development and issuance of the Company s
Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock ). Management expects near term financial results to be negatively
impacted by these activities as a result of incurring costs of accrued preferred stock dividends, strategic planning and development
costs and other growth associated costs. 

The
Company s wines are made from grapes grown in vineyards owned, leased or contracted by the Company, and from grapes purchased from
other vineyards. The grapes are harvested, fermented and made into wine primarily at the Company s winery in Turner Oregon (the
 Winery and the wines are sold principally under the Company s Willamette Valley Vineyards label, but also under
the Griffin Creek, Pambrun, Elton, Maison Bleue, Metis, Natoma, Pere Ami, Elton, Domaine Willamette and Tualatin Estates labels. The
Company also owns the Tualatin Estate Vineyards and Winery, located near Forest Grove, Oregon and the Domaine Willamette Winery located
near Dundee, Oregon . The Company generates revenues from the sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers. 

Direct
to consumer sales primarily include sales through the Company s tasting rooms, telephone, internet and wine club. Direct to consumer
sales are at a higher unit price than sales through distributors due to prices received being closer to retail than those prices paid
by wholesalers. The Company continues to emphasize growth in direct to consumer sales through the Company s existing tasting rooms
and the opening of new locations, and growth in wine club membership. Additionally, the Company s Preferred Stock sales since August
2015 have resulted in approximately 14,385 new preferred stockholders many of which the Company believes are wine enthusiasts. When considering
joint ownership, we believe these new stockholders represent approximately 21,577 current and potential customers of the Company. 

Periodically,
the Company will sell grapes or bulk wine, due to them not meeting Company standards or being in excess of production targets, however
this is not a significant part of the Company s activities. 

The
Company sold 135,424 and 143,286 cases of produced wine during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease
of 7,862 cases, or 5.5 in the current year period over the prior year period. The decrease in wine case sales was primarily the
result of decreased case sales through distributors. 

Cost
of sales includes grape costs, whether purchased or grown at Company vineyards, winemaking and processing costs, bottling, packaging,
warehousing, and shipping and handling costs. For grapes grown at Company vineyards, costs include farming expenditures and amortization
of vineyard development costs. 

At
September 30, 2024, wine inventory included 247,003 cases of bottled wine and 304,354 gallons of bulk wine in various stages of the
aging process. Case wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 24 months and generally before the release date of the next
vintage. The Winery bottled 245,193 cases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

We
continue to receive positive recognition through national magazines, regional publications, local newspapers and online bloggers including
the accolades below. 

The
tasting room at the Company s Estate Winery in the Salem Hills, Oregon clinched the award for the Best Wine Tasting
Room in the country in USA Today s 10 Best Readers Choice Awards. The Company also received the award
for #2 Best Wine Club in the nation. 

The
Company s Willamette Valley Vineyards 2021 Elton Pinot Noir received a 93 score, the 2022 Reisling scored 92 points, 2022 Estate

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Revenue 

Sales
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 9,370,713 and 9,348,066, respectively, an increase of 22,647,
or 0.2 , in the current year period over the prior year period. This increase was caused by an
increase in direct sales of 245,797 partly offset by a decrease in sales through distributors of 223,150 in the current year three-month
period over the prior year period. The increase in direct sales to consumers in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same
quarter of 2023 was primarily the result of revenues from opening a new tasting room in late 2023. The decrease in revenue from sales
through distributors was primarily related to lower case sales in this market. Sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 were 28,506,151 and 28,383,249, respectively, an increase of 122,902, or 0.4 , in the current year period over the prior
year period. This increase was caused by an increase in revenues from direct sales of 663,479
partly offset by a decrease in revenues from sales through distributors of 540,577 in the current year period over the prior year period.
 The increase in revenues from direct sales to consumers in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was
primarily the result of revenues from a new tasting room opened in late 2023. The decrease in sales through distributors was primarily
the result of a decrease in off-premise sales. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3,562,599 and 3,663,488, respectively, a decrease of 100,889,
or 2.8 , in the current period over the prior year period. This change was primarily the result of fewer products sold in the current
quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 10,953,625
and 11,969,630, respectively, a decrease of 1,016,005 or 8.5 , in the current period over the prior year period. This change was primarily
the result of a reduction in product sales in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 62.0 and 60.8 , respectively, an increase
of 1.2 percentage points in the current year period over the prior year period, mostly as a result of a higher percentage of total sales
coming from direct sales, which have higher margins than sales through distributors combined with a change in product mix in the third
quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 was 61.6 and 57.8 , respectively, an increase of 3.8 percentage points in the current year period over the prior year
period. This increase was primarily the result of higher prices being charged for products and a higher percentage of total sales coming
from direct sales in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5,944,620 and 5,967,346 respectively,
a decrease of 22,726, or 0.4 , in the current quarter over the same quarter in the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result
of a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of 25,028, or 0.6 being partially offset by an increase in general and administrative
expenses of 2,302, or 0.1 in the current quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 17,754,703 and 17,362,498, respectively, an increase of 392,205, or 2.3 ,
in the current year period over the prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in selling and marketing
expenses of 7,302, or 0.1 combined with an increase in general and administrative expenses of 384,903, or 8.2 in the current year
period compared to the same period in 2023. General and administrative expenses increased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to
the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher legal costs. 

Interest
Expense, Net 

Interest
expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 257,192 and 171,272, respectively, an increase of 85,920
or 50.2 , in the third quarter of 2024 over the same quarter in the prior year. Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 were 750,573 and 460,309, respectively, an increase of 290,264 or 63.1 , in the current year period over the prior
year period. The increase in interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was primarily the result of increased
debt compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. 

16 

Income
Taxes 

The
income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 115,177 and 123,344, respectively, a decrease of 8,167
or 6.6 , in the third quarter of 2024 over the same quarter in the prior year mostly as a result of the lower pre-tax loss in the third
quarter of 2024, compared to the same quarter in 2023. The Company s estimated federal and state combined income tax rate was 28.9 
and 27.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 247,809 and 363,396, respectively, a decrease of 115,587 or 31.8 in the current year period over the prior
year period, mostly a result of the lower pre-tax loss in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The Company s
estimated federal and state combined income tax rate was 28.9 and 27.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Loss

in the third quarter of 2024 over the same quarter in the prior year. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
was 608,772 and 963,352, respectively, a decrease of 354,580, or 36.8 , in the current year period over the prior year period. The
decrease in the net loss for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, compared to the comparable periods in 2023, was primarily
the result of higher prices for products sold in 2024. 

Net
Loss Applicable to Common Shareholders 

Net
loss applicable to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 846,195 and 838,701, respectively,
an increase of 7,494, or 0.9 , in the third quarter of 2024 over the same quarter in the prior year, mostly as a result of a lower net
loss being more than offset by a higher accrued preferred stock dividend in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of
2023. Net loss applicable to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,298,448 and 2,498,510,
respectively, a decrease of 200,062, or 8.0 , in the current year period over the prior year period. The decrease in loss applicable
to common shareholders in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, was the result of a lower net loss being
partially offset by a higher accrued preferred stock dividend in the current period. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital balance of 22.6 million and a current working capital ratio of 2.85:1.

Total
cash used for operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,159,828. Cash used in operating activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily associated with reduced grapes payable and increased inventories, being partially

the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of cash used on property and equipment and vineyard development costs. 

Total
cash generated from financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,879,693. Cash generated from financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Stock and proceeds from long

In
December of 2005, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with Umpqua Bank (the Credit Agreement that allows borrowing up to 2,000,000 against eligible accounts receivable and inventories as collateral, as defined in the agreement.
The revolving line bears interest at prime less 0.5 , with a floor of 3.25 , is payable monthly, and is subject to renewal. In July 2021,
the Company renewed the Credit Agreement until July 31, 2023. In November 2022, the Company increased the borrowing line up to 5,000,000.
In July 2023 the line of credit was renewed for an additional two years. The Company had an outstanding line of credit balance of 3,460,004

net worth, debt-to-equity, and debt service coverage, as defined, and limits the level of acquisitions of property and equipment. As
of December 31, 2023, the Company was out of compliance with a debt covenant. The Company has received a waiver from Umpqua Bank waiving
this violation until the next measurement date of December 31, 2024.

of September 30, 2024, the Company had a 15-year installment note payable of 1,022,778, due in quarterly payments of 42,534, associated
with the purchase of property in the Dundee Hills AVA.

ITEM
3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-5 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of the end
of the period covered by this report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files
or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

PART
II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1 - Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, the Company is a party to various judicial and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The
Company s management and legal counsel have reviewed the probable outcome of any proceedings that were pending during the period
covered by this report, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the Company s
insurance coverage, and the Company s established liabilities. While the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty, based on the Company s review, the Company believes that any unrecorded liability that may result as a result of any
legal proceedings is not likely to have a material effect on the Company s liquidity, financial condition or results from operations.
