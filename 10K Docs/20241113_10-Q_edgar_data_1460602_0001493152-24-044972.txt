operating cashflows of . The Company s activities have been funded by generating revenue, through offerings of its securities,
and through proceeds from loans. There is no assurance that the Company s business will generate sustainable positive cash flows
to fund its activities. 

The
Company will need to use mitigating actions such as seeking additional financing, refinancing, or amending the terms of existing loans,
or postponing expenses that are not based on firm commitments. In order to fund its operations until such time that the Company can generate
sustainable positive cash flows, the Company will need to raise additional funds. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and as
of the date of this report, the Company has assessed its financial condition and concluded that based on current and projected cash resources
and commitments, as well as other factors mentioned above, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is planning to raise additional capital to continue its operations and to repay its outstanding loans when they become due,
as well as to explore additional avenues to increase revenues and reduce or delay expenditures. In May 2024, the Company entered into
debt exchange agreements with three convertible debt holders pursuant to which a total of of outstanding principal and accrued
interest were exchanged for the right to receive an aggregate of shares of Common Stock. The Company may also exchange some
of its other outstanding loans and accounts payable for securities of the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to exchange its outstanding loans and accounts payable for
securities of the Company. 

The
Company s Common Stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and now trades on the OTCQX. Such delisting and trading on the
OTCQX may make it more difficult to raise additional capital. 

The
estimation and execution uncertainty regarding the Company s future cash flows and management s judgments and assumptions
in estimating these cash flows is a significant estimate. Those assumptions include reasonableness of the forecasted revenue, operating
expenses, and uses and sources of cash.

Fair
Value of Consideration Transferred 

Accounting
guidance provides that the allocation of the purchase price may be adjusted for up to one year from the date of the acquisition to the
extent that additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The primary
area of the purchase price allocation that is not yet finalized is related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and certain
other assets and tax matters and the related impact on goodwill. 

In
evaluating the fair value of the Octomera Equity Investment under the income approach, the Company used a discounted cash flow model
of the business, adjusted to the Company s share in the investment. Key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value
included: (a) internal cash flows forecasts for 5 years following the assessment date, including expected revenue growth, costs to produce,
operating profit margins and estimated capital needs; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year long-term future growth determined
based on the growth prospects of the reporting units; and (c) a discount rate which reflects the weighted average cost of capital adjusted
for the relevant risk associated with the Company s reporting unit operations and the uncertainty inherent in the Company s
internally developed forecasts. The allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in the
recognition of other intangible assets, net, which comprised of technology. The useful life of the technology for amortization purposes
was determined by considering the period of expected cash flows generated by the assets used to measure the fair value of the intangible
assets, adjusted as appropriate for the entity-specific factors including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other
factors that may limit the useful life of intangible assets.

Fair
value assumptions used in accounting for contingent consideration 

On
January 29, 2024, in connection with the PPA study of Octomera LLC, the Company recognized a contingent consideration to pay MM based
on two components: 

1. Royalties based on revenues in 2025, 2026 and 2027, and; 
2. An earnout amount, which is dependent on a future triggering event being either an IPO or exit. 

The
estimated fair value of the contingent consideration is based on management s assessment of whether, and at what level, the financial
metrics will be achieved, and the present value factors associated with the timing of the payments. This fair value measurement is based
on significant unobservable inputs in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement and used the Monte Carlo pricing
model to calculate the fair value, which was 
 as of January 29, 2024. As of September 30, 2024,
the fair value was .

. In addition, the plaintiffs seek that the defendants provide financial statements and pay NIS
 to the plaintiffs due to the royalty provisions of the license agreement, dated February 2, 2012, between the Israeli subsidiary
and Tel Hashomer Medical Research, Infrastructure and Services Ltd. (the License Agreement ). The Complaint alleges that
the Company and the Israeli subsidiary used know-how and technology of Sheba and know-how and technology either developed or supervised
by Prof. Ferber while employed by Sheba in the field of cell therapy, including in the category of the point-of-care platform and the
services and products in relation to the defendants CDMO activity and are entitled to the payment of certain royalties pursuant
to the terms of the License Agreement. The defendants have filed their statements of defense responding to this Complaint, the Plaintiffs
filed their response and the parties are now conducting disclosure proceedings in accordance with Israel s civil regulations. In
accordance with Israel s civil regulations, the parties considered alternative means to resolve at least some of the disputes and
have consented to engage the services of a mutually agreeable mediator. The mediation is currently taking place. According to management s
estimation, since a loss is not considered probable, no provision was made in the financial statements. 

On
September 6, 2023, a claim (the Claim was filed in the Tel Aviv District Court (the Court against the Company,
the Israeli Subsidiary, Octomera LLC, Orgenesis Biotech Israel Ltd, Theracell Laboratories Private Company and Vered Caplan (collectively,
the defendants by Ehud Almon (Plaintiff) for certain finders fees and / or royalties related to sales made by an
Octomera subsidiary to a Greek entity in the amount of and also for other means of compensation. The Israeli Subsidiary and Vered
Caplan filed their statement of defense on January 28, 2024 claiming, inter alia, that the Plaintiff did not serve as a broker, but rather
served as the Greek entity s representative and as such he is not entitled to compensation of any kind from the defendants. It
was also clarified that the defendants did not enter into a finder s agreement with the Plaintiff. Additionally, the Israeli subsidiary
and Vered Caplan claimed that the Plaintiff concealed material information from the court, including the signed partnership agreement
between the Greek entity s owner and the Plaintiff, as well as certain criminal charges brought against him in Greece. On February
22, 2024, the Plaintiff filed a request for service of process to deliver the Claim to the Company and the other defendants incorporated
outside of Israel. This request was denied on the same day. An appeal filed by the Plaintiff on the aforementioned decision was denied.
On May 27, 2024, the Plaintiff filed a new request for service of process to deliver the Claim to the Company and the other defendants
incorporated outside of Israel. On May 28, 2024 the request was accepted. The court ruled that the Claim be delivered via courier to
the Company and Octomera LLC, and delivered in accordance with the Hague Convention to Theracell Laboratories. After requesting a continuance,
on September 18, 2024, the Plaintiff filed an update that the Claim was
delivered to the Company and Octomera LLC on August 16, 2024. On the same day, the Claimant also filed a motion, petitioning that the
Claim will be delivered to Theracell Laboratories via the Company or via Vered Caplan, in order to minimize the costs of translating and
delivering the Claim to Greece. On October 7, 2024 Vered Caplan filed her opposition to the abovementioned motion, claiming that there
is no legal basis for the Claimant s request, especially since the ruling regarding the service of process was made per the Plaintiff s
request. On October 10, 2024 the Company filed its opposition to the request, on the same basis, mentioning, inter alia, that the claim
itself has no connection to Israel and that the Israeli courts are not the appropriate forum for the Plaintiff s claims. Ruling
on the abovementioned motion is pending. According
to management s estimation, since the likelihood of the Plaintiff winning the case is less than fifty percent, no provision was
made in the financial statements. 

On
October 26, 2023, a complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by plaintiffs Southern Israel Bridging Fund Two
LP and Mr. Amir Hasidim, against the Company, seeking the payment of together with interest in the amount of . In the Complaint

in light of the plaintiffs breach of obligations under the Convertible Loan Agreement and the damages caused to the Company as
a result of said breach. The Company counter sued as well, seeking damages for Plaintiff s breach of contract, fraud and harassment.
Accordingly, the Company disputes whether it owes plaintiffs the amount sought in the Complaint. 

On
November 1, 2023, a claim (the Claim was filed in the Tel Aviv District Court (the Court against the Company,
the Israeli Subsidiary, and Vered Caplan (collectively, the Defendants by Fidelity Venture Capital Ltd. and Dror Atzmon
(together the Plaintiffs ). The claim is based on two agreements the Company entered into with the Plaintiffs on
November 2, 2016: (a) an unsecured convertible note agreements for an aggregate amount of NIS million ). The loan bears a monthly
interest rate of and will mature on May 1, 2017, unless converted earlier and (b) a consultation agreement which awarded the Plaintiffs
 thousand warrants. The exercise price of the warrants and conversion price were fixed at per share (pre-reverse stock split implemented
by the Company in November 2017). On April 27, 2017, and November 2, 2017, the Company entered into extension agreements through November
2, 2017 and May 2, 2018, respectively, in connection with the convertible note agreements. In March 2018, the Plaintiffs submitted a
notice of their intention to convert into shares the Company s common stock, the principal amount of the loan, and accrued interest
of approximately outstanding. In addition, the Plaintiffs exercised all the warrants awarded in the consultation agreement. In light
of the reverse stock split which took place in November 2017, the Company disagreed with the plaintiffs calculations regarding
the number of issuable shares of Common Stock. The Company responded to the notice and rejected these contentions in their entirety.
In April 2018, the Company terminated the agreements based on several claims, including mistake, intentional misrepresentation and bad
faith. Therefore, the Company deposited the shares in total amount of issued under those agreements and the principal amount and
accrued interest of the loan in an escrow account. The deposit of the principal amount and accrued interest presented as restricted cash
in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. Based on the calculation difference, in their Claim, the Plaintiffs request damages in
the amount of NIS , and the issuance of shares of the Company. The Defendants filed their statement of defense on April
15, 2024, in which they raised, among others, the aforementioned claims and additional procedural and substantial claims, including laches. The parties have agreed to start mediation
proceeding in connection with the Claim. According to management s estimation, since the likelihood of the Plaintiffs winning the
case is less than fifty percent, no provision was made in the financial statements. 

On
July 11, 2024 the Israeli subsidiary reached a settlement agreement regarding unpaid rentals sanctioned by the Tel Aviv Magistrate s
court pursuant to which the subsidiary will pay the amount of NIS (approximately including VAT to the lessor of leased
premises no later than September 30, 2024, which includes a grace period for late payments. As of the date of this quarterly report on
Form 10-Q, the Company had paid all of the settlement amount less , and the lessor agreed to defer payment of the to December 28, 2024. In the event that the Company fails to meet all of its obligations under the settlement agreement, the Company may be liable
to pay an additional NIS (approximately over and above the amount still due, in respect of claims for unpaid rentals made
by the lessor. 

Except
as described above, the Company is not involved in any pending material legal proceedings.

Business
Overview 

We
are a global biotech company working to unlock the potential of CGTs in an affordable and accessible format. CGTs can be centered on
autologous (using the patient s own cells) or allogenic (using master banked donor cells) and are part of a class of medicines
referred to as advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs. We are mostly focused on autologous therapies that can be manufactured
under processes and systems that are developed for each therapy using a closed and automated approach that is validated for compliant
production near the patient for treatment of the patient at the point of care, or POCare. This approach has the potential to overcome
the limitations of traditional commercial manufacturing methods that do not translate well to commercial production of advanced therapies
due to their cost prohibitive nature and complex logistics to deliver such treatments to patients (ultimately limiting the number of
patients that can have access to, or can afford, these therapies). 

To
achieve these goals, we have developed a collaborative worldwide network of research institutes and hospitals who are engaged in the
POCare model, or our POCare Network, and a pipeline of licensed POCare advanced therapies that can be processed and produced under such
closed and automated processes and systems, or POCare Therapies. We are developing our pipeline of advanced therapies with the goal of
entering into out-licensing agreements for these therapies. 

We
have two operating segments our POCare Services and our therapeutic development operations. We conduct our core POCare operations
through our wholly-owned subsidiary Octomera LLC which was a consolidated subsidiary of ours until June 30, 2023 and which became a consolidated
subsidiary again effective January 29, 2024 when we entered into a unit purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired all of the equity
interests of Octomera LLC. 

Octomera
segment (mainly POCare Services) 

The
POCare Services that we and our affiliated entities perform include: 

Process
 development of therapies, process adaptation, and optimization inside the OMPULs, or OMPULization 

Adaptation
 of automation and closed systems to serviced therapies; 

Incorporation
 of the serviced therapies compliant with GMP in the OMPULs that we designed and built; 

Tech
 transfers and training of local teams for the serviced therapies at the POCare Centers; 

Processing
 and supply of the therapies and required supplies under GMP conditions within our POCare Network, including required quality control
 testing; 

The
POCare Services are performed in decentralized hubs that provide harmonized and standardized services to customers, or POCare Centers.
We are working to expand the number and scope of our POCare Centers. We believe that this provides an efficient and scalable pathway
for CGT therapies to reach patients rapidly at lowered costs. Our POCare Services are designed to allow rapid capacity expansion while
integrating new technologies to bring together patients, doctors and industry partners with a goal of achieving standardized, regulated
clinical development and production of therapies. 

Therapies
segment (POCare Therapies) 

While
the biotech industry struggles to determine the best way to lower the cost of goods and enable CGTs to scale, the scientific community
continues to advance and push the development of such therapies to new heights. Clinicians and researchers are excited by many new tools
(such as new generations of industrial viruses and big data analysis for genetic and molecular data) and technologies (CRISPR, mRNA,
etc.) available, often at a low cost, to perform advanced research in small labs. Most new therapies arise from research at academic
institutions or at small spinouts from such institutions. Though such research efforts may manage to progress into a clinical stage,
utilizing lab- or hospital-based production solutions, they generally lack the resources to continue the development of such drugs to
market approval. 

30 

Historically,
drug/therapeutic development has required investments of hundreds of millions of dollars to be successful. One significant cause for
the high cost is that each therapy often requires unique production facilities and technologies that must be subcontracted or built.
Furthermore, the cost of production during the clinical stage is extremely expensive, and the cost of the clinical trial itself is very
high. Given these financial restraints, researchers and institutions hope to out-license their therapeutic products to large biotech
companies or to spin out new companies and conduct large fundraising rounds. In many cases, however, they lack the resources and the
capability to de-risk their therapeutic candidates enough to be attractive for such fundings or partnership. 

Our
POCare Network is an alternative to the traditional pathway of drug development. Orgenesis works closely with many such institutes and
is in close contact with researchers in the field. The partnerships with leading hospitals and research institutes gives us a deep insight
as to the developments in the field, as well as the market potential, the regulatory landscape and optimal clinical pathway to get these
products to market. 

The
ability to produce these products at low cost allows for an expedited development process, and partnership with hospitals around the
globe allows for joint grants and lower costs of clinical development. The POCare Therapies division reviews many therapies available
for out-licensing and selects the ones they believe have the highest market potential and chance of clinical success and can benefit
the most from a point of care approach. It assesses such issues by utilizing its global POCare Network and its internal know-how accumulated
over a decade of involvement in the field. 

The
goal of this in-licensing is to quickly adapt such therapies to a point-of- care approach through regional partnerships, and to out-license
the products for market approval in non-core geographical regions. This approach lowers overall development costs by minimizing our pre-clinical
development costs and enabling us to receive additional funding from grants and/or payments by regional partners. 

Significant
developments during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 

On
September 27, 2023, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq stating that the bid price of the Common Stock had closed at less than 1.00 per share over the previous 30 consecutive business days,
and, as a result, did not comply with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule ). On April 17, 2024, we received a notice
(the Notice from the Staff which stated that it could not accept a plan to regain compliance and the Staff stated that
our securities would be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market unless we timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the
 Panel to address the deficiencies and present a plan to regain compliance. As permitted by the Notice, we timely requested
a hearing before the Panel, which request stayed any further delisting action by the Staff pending the ultimate outcome of the hearing
and the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel. On June 6, 2024, we met with the Panel regarding our potential
delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market as a result of our violation of the Bid Price Rule and non-compliance with the equity requirement
in Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Equity Rule or any of the alternative requirements in Listing Rule 5550(b). On June 8,
2024, we received the Panel s decision which granted us until October 14, 2024 to regain compliance with the Bid Price and Equity
Rules. On October 17, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that the Panel had determined to delist the Company s Common Stock and
that trading of the Company s Common Stock will be suspended at the open of trading on October 21, 2024. In connection with the
Nasdaq delisting notice, Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25 Notification of Delisting with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC after applicable appeal periods have lapsed. The Company s Common Stock began trading
under ORGS on the OTCQX with the open of the markets on October 21, 2024. 

On
January 29, 2024 Closing or Transaction date or Reconsolidation date ), we and Metalmark Capital
Partners MM entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the MM UPA ), pursuant to which we acquired all of the
preferred units of Octomera previously owned by MM and reconsolidated Octomera into our accounts with immediate effect (the MM
acquisition ). As consideration for the MM Acquisition, we and MM agreed to the following consideration: 

Royalty
 Payments: If Octomera and its subsidiaries generate Net Revenue during the three-year period 2025-2027, then we will pay 5 of Net
 Revenues to MM pursuant to the MM UPA. 

31 

Milestone
 Payments: If we sell Octomera within ten years from the date of the Closing at a price that is more than 40 million excluding consideration
 for certain Excluded Assets as per the UPA, then we will pay MM 5 of the net proceeds of that sale. 

Pursuant
to the MM acquisition, MM s designated members of the Board of Managers of Octomera resigned, and we amended the Second Amended
and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Octomera (the Octomera LLC Agreement to be a single member agreement
reflecting the MM acquisition, such that MM no longer (i) was a member of Octomera or a party to the Octomera LLC Agreement, or (ii)
had the right to appoint members of the board of managers of Octomera. 

In
addition, 10 secured promissory notes between Orgenesis Maryland LLC and MM, reflecting an aggregate outstanding principal amount of
 2,600 (the Notes ), were amended to, among other things, extend the maturity thereof to January 29, 2034 and to terminate
the security interest granted by Orgenesis Maryland LLC in favor of MM that secured the obligations under the Notes. 

On

Our
revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 734, as compared to 365 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing
an increase of 101 . The increase was as a result of work completed and payments received on cell processing development and hospital
services.

for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 10 . 

The
increase in salaries and related expenses is mainly attributable to our accounting for Octomera segment cost of development services
and research and development expenses from the reconsolidation date compared to accounting for such expenses in 2023 until the deconsolidation
of Octomera. Professional fees and consulting services declined as a result of cost savings. Other research and development expenses
increased mainly as a result of the Asset Purchase Agreements referred to in Note 11.

The
decrease was mainly as a result of a decrease in credit losses incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, mainly in the Octomera segment, offset by an increase in business development expenses as a result of
warrants granted to advisers.

incurred on warrants issued to loan holders.

Current
assets decreased by 1,557 between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 The decrease was mainly attributable to a decline in cash
and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, and receivables from related parties. 

Current
liabilities increased by 19,642 between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 The increase was mainly attributable to: 

the
 reconsolidation of Octomera which included an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables, employees and related
 payables, and advance payments on account of grants; 

the
 deconsolidation of OBI where we recorded an increase in accounts payable to related parties; 

the
 Germfree receipt which was recorded in current liabilities. 

Additional
 non-convertible short term loan agreements entered into. 

The
above increases were offset by a decline in current maturities of convertible loans, converted to equity.

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 14,978, as compared to net cash used
in operating activities of approximately 14,335 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
change was mainly as a result of: 

a net loss of 28,637 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 58,295 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023;

Net
cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 73, as compared to net cash used
in investing activities of approximately 3,645 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was mainly as a result of a
decline in purchases of property and equipment and the cash impact from the deconsolidation of Octomera which incurred in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 not incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 14,560, as compared to net cash
provided by financing activities of approximately 12,393 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was mainly attributable
to proceeds raised from equity investments and warrant exercises in the amount of 2,556 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024
as compared to 4,341 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we raised
convertible loans in the amount of 75 compared to 5,660 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, These decreases were offset by
the receipt of 6,720 from Germfree and non-convertible loans received in the amount of 4,670 in the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to 425 received in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
 Capital Resources Outlook 

Through
September 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 204,411 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 incurred negative operating cashflows
of 14,978. Our activities have been funded by generating revenue, proceeds from loan agreements, and through offerings of our securities.
There is no assurance that our business will generate sustainable positive cash flows to fund our operations. 

The
estimation and execution uncertainty regarding our future cash flows and management s judgments and assumptions in estimating these
cash flows is a significant estimate. Those assumptions include reasonableness of the forecasted revenue, operating expenses, and uses
and sources of cash. 

Due
to our financial position, we will need to seek additional financing, refinance or amend the terms of existing convertible loans, and/or
postpone expenses that are not based on firm commitments. In order to fund our operations until such time that we can generate sustainable
positive cash flows, we will need to raise additional funds. As of the date of this report, we have assessed our financial condition
and concluded that based on our current and projected cash resources and commitments, as well as other factors mentioned above, there
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are planning to raise additional capital to continue our operations
and to repay our outstanding loans when they become due, as well as to explore additional avenues to increase revenues and reduce or
delay expenditures. Our failure to remain listed on Nasdaq will make it more difficult to raise additional capital. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Despite our ability to secure capital in the past, there
can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing will be available to us or that we may be able to secure funding from any
other sources. In the event that we are not able to secure funding, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop ongoing development
activities, cease operations altogether,and/or file for bankruptcy. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing disclosure controls and procedures,
our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls
and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based
upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting . 

Management
determined that we had the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023: 

We
did not perform appropriate analyses related to our internal control over financial reporting in the accounting for whether it is probable
we will collect substantially all the consideration to which we are entitled for revenue services provided, as well as our estimated
credit losses. As of September 30, 2024, such material weakness ha d not been remediated. 

Remediation
Activities 

Management s
remediation activities, which have already commenced and will continue during 2024, include the design of enhanced controls that include
a thorough credit assessment of all new customers, analysis of payment history for existing customers and its impact related to the accounting
for revenues, and additional controls designed to calculate the expected credit loss on the balances when there is an indication that
a customer may not be pay the full receivable amount. These controls are already designed, however, management will need a number of periods
in order to ensure their effectiveness. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Except
as set forth above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30,
2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Information

Except
as described above, we are not involved in any pending material legal proceedings. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

An
investment in the Company s Common Stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors
included in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with
the SEC on April 15, 2024, in addition to other information contained in our reports and in this quarterly report in evaluating the Company
and its business before purchasing shares of our Common Stock. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our
risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company s business, operating
results and financial condition could be adversely affected due to any of those risks. 

We
may be unsuccessful in raising the capital necessary to address our going concern issues, or if we are successful, it may be on terms
that are highly dilutive to existing stockholders. 

Historically,
we funded our operations by raising capital from external sources, including through the sale of common stock and convertible loans.
We are currently facing significant challenges to our ability to raise significant amounts of capital through the sale of common stock,
including the following factors: 

in
 general, it is difficult for development stage companies to raise capital under current market conditions; 

the
 perception that we may be unable to continue as a going concern may impede our ability to attract further equity investment; and 

our
 common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and our common stock began trading on the OTCQX on October 21, 2024. The
 delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital through the public or private
 sale of equity securities. 

Given
these factors, there can be no assurances we will be successful at raising sufficient capital to address our going concern issues. However,
if we are successful, it may be on terms that are very dilutive to existing stockholders. Despite our ability to secure capital in the
past, there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing will be available to us or that we may be able to secure funding
from any other sources. In the event that we are not able to secure funding, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop ongoing
development activities, cease operations altogether, and/or file for bankruptcy. 

The
delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital through the public or private
sale of equity securities and the ability of investors to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our common
stock . 

Our
common stock was delisted by Nasdaq and our common stock currently trades on the OTCQX market. Our lack of a listing on a national securities
exchange will likely result in it being more difficult for us to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity
securities and for investors to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our common stock. In addition, there
can be no assurance that our common stock will be able to maintain its eligibility for trading on the OTCQX or any alternative exchange
or markets. 

Unless
our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, such as the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may also be subject
to the regulations regarding trading in penny stocks, which are those securities trading for less than 5.00 per share,
and that are not otherwise exempted from the definition of a penny stock under other exemptions provided for in the applicable regulations.
The following is a list of the general restrictions on the sale of penny stocks: 

Before
 the sale of penny stock by a broker-dealer to a new purchaser, the broker-dealer must determine whether the purchaser is suitable
 to invest in penny stocks. To make that determination, a broker-dealer must obtain, from a prospective investor, information regarding
 the purchaser s financial condition, investment experience, and objectives. Subsequently, the broker-dealer must deliver to
 the purchaser a written statement setting forth the basis of the suitability finding and obtain the purchaser s signature on
 such statement. 

42 

A
 broker-dealer must obtain from the purchaser an agreement to purchase the securities. This agreement must be obtained for every purchase
 until the purchaser becomes an established customer. 

The
 Exchange Act requires that before effecting any transaction in any penny stock, a broker-dealer must provide the purchaser with a
 risk disclosure document that contains, among other things, a description of the penny stock market and how it functions,
 and the risks associated with such investment. These disclosure rules are applicable to both purchases and sales by investors. 

A
 dealer that sells penny stock must send to the purchaser, within 10 days after the end of each calendar month, a written account
 statement including prescribed information relating to the security. 

These
requirements can severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because fewer brokers or dealers are likely to be
willing to undertake these compliance activities. If our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, the rules and
restrictions regarding penny stock transactions may limit an investor s ability to sell to a third party and our trading activity
in the secondary market may be reduced. 

We
conduct certain of our operations in Israel. Conditions in Israel, including the attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and other terrorist
organizations and Israel s war against them, may affect certain of our operations. 

Because
we conduct certain operations in the State of Israel, some of our business and operations may be affected by economic, political, geopolitical
and military conditions in Israel. In October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and
conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and
industrial centers located along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. Following the
attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist organizations commenced
in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. Moreover, the clash between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, may escalate in
the future into a greater regional conflict. The intensity and duration of Israel s current war against Hamas is difficult to predict,
as are such war s economic implications on the Company s business and operations and on Israel s economy in general. 

Any
hostilities involving Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and its trading partners could
adversely affect certain of our operations and results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. The conflict
in Israel could also result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated
to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements. There have been travel advisories
imposed relating to travel to Israel, and restriction on travel, or delays and disruptions as related to imports and exports may be imposed
in the future. Additionally, certain members of our management and employees are located and reside in Israel. Shelter-in-place and work-from-home
measures, government-imposed restrictions on movement and travel and other precautions taken to address the ongoing conflict may temporarily
disrupt our management and employees ability to effectively perform their daily tasks. 

The
Israel Defense Forces (the IDF ), the national military of Israel, is a conscripted military service, subject to certain
exceptions. Certain of our R D and finance personnel live in Israel. Certain of our employees are subject to military service in
the IDF and have been called to serve, and additional employees may be called to serve in the future. It is possible that there will
be further military reserve duty call-ups in the future, which may affect our business due to a shortage of skilled labor and loss of
institutional knowledge, and necessary mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime
and third-party outsourcing, for example, may have unintended negative effects and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity
or cash flows. Additionally, the absence of employees of our Israeli suppliers and service providers due to their military service in
the current or future wars or other armed conflicts may disrupt their operations, which in turn may adversely affect our ability to deliver
or provide products and services to customers. 

The
hostilities with Hamas, Hezbollah and other organizations and countries have included and may include terror, missile and drone attacks.
In the event that any of our facilities, including back-up information technology systems located in Israel, are damaged as a result
of hostile actions, or hostilities otherwise disrupt our ongoing operations, our ability to deliver or provide products and services
in a timely manner to meet our contractual obligations towards customers and vendors could be adversely affected. Our commercial insurance
does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli government currently
covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this
government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us
could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively
affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations. 

43 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, our operations have not been directly negatively affected by the ongoing hostilities in the region.
As a result, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, our ability to deliver or provide products and services to our customers has not
been materially affected. We cannot currently assess how the ongoing hostilities will affect our business conditions and harm our results
of operations in the future, given the factors and risks discussed above.
