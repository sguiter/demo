 The Agreement stated that if net profits received by the Company did not reach plus times any additional funding within twelve months of the effective date, the Company had the right to terminate the Agreement. The Agreement also stated that TWS South would devote substantially all time and attention to the joint venture. Following the discovery that TWS South breached the Agreement by assuming ownership and operating another drilling company, the Company terminated the Agreement on April 19, 2024.

The facts of the case are in discovery and the Company does not have enough information to determine whether a contingent liability exists for TWS and there is no liability recorded. The lawsuit does, however, create significant uncertainty about the collectability of TWS South accounts receivable, therefore, an allowance for credit losses in the amount of is recorded in Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a bad debt expense recorded in General, Administrative and Other on the Consolidated Income Statement.
