In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The amendments in this update extend the transition relief period for reference rate reform from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.

ASU 2022-06 was effective upon issuance. The new standard has had no material impact on the Company's financial statements. In November, 2023 the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 aims to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The update also requires disclosure regarding the chief operating decision maker and expands the interim segment disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We currently are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on our financial statements. From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB and other regulatory bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements upon adoption.

 components: the general reserve and specific reserves. The Company s calculation of the general reserve considers the historical loan default rates and collateral recovery rates for the last and any qualitative factors both internal and external to the Company. Specific reserves are determined based on probable losses on specific classified impaired loans. The Company s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrower s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due, which generally is when either principal or interest is past due and remains unpaid for more than 90 days. Management implemented this policy based on an analysis of historical data, current performance of loans and the likelihood of recovery once principal or interest payments became delinquent and were aged more than 90 days. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are accounted for on a cash basis, first to interest and then to principal, as long as the remaining book balance of the asset is deemed to be collectible. The accrual of interest resumes when the past due principal or interest payments are brought within 90 days of being current. Impaired loans are those loans for which it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. A loan is generally deemed impaired if it is more than 90 days past due on principal or interest, is in bankruptcy proceedings, or is in the process of repossession. A specific reserve is created for impaired loans based on fair value of underlying collateral value, less estimated selling costs. The Company uses various factors to determine the value of the underlying collateral for impaired loans. These factors include: (1) the length of time the unit remained unsold after construction; (2) the amount of time the house was occupied; (3) the cooperation level of the borrowers (for example, loans requiring legal action or extensive field collection efforts may have a reduced value); (4) the physical location of the home; (5) the length of time the borrower has lived in the house without making payments; (6) the size of the home and market conditions; and (7) the experience and expertise of the particular dealer assisting in collection efforts. Collateral for repossessed loans is acquired through foreclosure or similar proceedings and is recorded at the estimated fair value of the home, less the costs to sell. At repossession, the collateral is recorded at the same amount as the principal balance as the loan. The fair value of the collateral is then computed based on the historical recovery rates of previously charged off loans, the loan is charged off and the loss is charged to the allowance for loan losses. At each reporting period, the fair value of the collateral is adjusted to the lower of the amount recorded at repossession or the estimated sales price less estimated costs to sell, based on current information. Repossessed homes from the consumer loan portfolio totaled and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheets.

We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are right-of-use ROU assets and are shown as ROU assets operating leases on our balance sheets. The lease liabilities are shown as Operating lease obligation and Operating lease obligation, less current portion on our balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We have elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. Therefore, lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability include all fixed payments in the lease arrangement. We record a ROU asset for an amount equal to the lease liability, increased for any prepaid lease costs and initial direct costs and reduced by any lease incentives. We remeasure the lease liability and ROU asset when a change to our future minimum lease payments occurs. Key assumptions and judgments included in the determination of the lease liability include the discount rate used in the present value calculation and the exercise of renewal options. Many of our leases contain renewal options. As the exercise of the renewal options is not likely at the commencement of a lease, we generally do not include the option periods in the lease term when determining the lease liabilities and ROU assets. We remeasure the lease liability and ROU asset when it is reasonably likely that we will exercise a renewal option. Our leases do not provide information about the rate implicit in the lease. Therefore, we utilize an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of our future lease obligations. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest we would otherwise pay on a collateralized borrowing, for an amount equal to the lease payments, over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining weighted-average lease term is years and the weighted-average discount rate is .

 variable lease costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Short-term leases, those with a term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on our balance sheet. Our short-term lease costs were not material for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Lease expense for operating leases consists of fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred.

 and liability for incurred but not reported claims, respectively. These accrued amounts are included in accrued liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets. The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with financial institutions providing inventory financing for independent retailers of its products. These arrangements, which are customary in the industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer. The Company s obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The Company believes that risk of loss is mitigated due to the resale value of the repurchased homes and the fact that the agreements are spread over many retailers. The maximum amount for which the Company was liable under such agreements approximated and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. The Company considers its obligations on current contracts to be immaterial and accordingly has not recorded any reserve for repurchase commitment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Leases. The Company leases facilities under operating leases that typically have terms. These leases usually offer the Company a right of first refusal that affords the Company the option to purchase the leased premises under certain terms in the event the landlord attempts to sell the leased premises to a third party. Rent expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively.

Rental income from the subleased properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately and , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately and , respectively. See Note 7 Leases, for a schedule of the Company s future minimum lease commitments. Legal Matters The Company is party to certain legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course and are incidental to its business. Certain of the claims pending against the Company in these proceedings allege, among other things, breach of contract and warranty, product liability and personal injury. The Company has determined that it is probable that it has some liability related to the claims. The Company has included legal reserves of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in accrued liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets. Although litigation is inherently uncertain, based on past experience and the information currently available, management does not believe that the currently pending and threatened litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, future events or circumstances currently unknown to management will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on the Company s financial position, liquidity or results of operations in any future reporting periods.

 The Company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable, consumer loans, MHP Notes, other notes, accounts payable, and lines of credit. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values because of the short-term maturities or expected settlement dates of these instruments. This is considered a Level I valuation technique. The lines of credit, part of the MHP Notes and part of the other notes receivables have variable interest rates that reflect market rates and their fair value approximates their carrying value. This is considered a Level II valuation technique. The Company also assessed the fair value of the consumer loans receivable, the fixed rate MHP Notes and the portion of other note receivables with fixed rates based on the discounted value of the remaining principal and interest cash flows.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes and the information contained in other sections of this Form 10-Q. It contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and is based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by our management in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in this Form 10-Q and in our Registration Statement on Form S-1, particularly under the heading Risk Factors. Dollar amounts are in thousands unless otherwise noted. Overview We build, sell and finance manufactured homes and tiny houses that are distributed through a network of independent retailers and company owned stores and also sold directly to manufactured home communities. We are the sixth largest producer of manufactured homes in the United States as ranked by the number of homes manufactured based on information available from the Manufactured Housing Institute and the Institute for Building Technology and Safety for the six month period ending June 30, 2024. With current operations focused primarily in the southern United States, we offer our customers an array of quality homes ranging in size from approximately 395 to 2,667 square feet consisting of 1 to 5 bedrooms and 1 to 3 1/2 bathrooms. Our homes range in price, at retail, from approximately 33,000 to 180,000. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 549 and 1,772 home sections, respectively (which are entire modules or single floors). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 643 and 2,246 home sections, respectively The Company has one reportable segment. All of our activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent and assessed based on how each of the activities of the Company supports the others. For example, the sale of manufactured homes includes providing transportation for dealers. We also provide financing options to the customers to facilitate home sales. Accordingly, all significant operating and strategic decisions by the chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, are based upon analyses of our company as one operating segment. We believe our company is one of the most vertically integrated in the manufactured housing industry, allowing us to offer a complete solution to our customers. We manufacture custom made homes using quality materials, distribute those homes through our expansive network of independent retailers and company owned distribution locations and provide tailored financing solutions for our customers. Our homes are constructed in the United States at one of our three manufacturing facilities in accordance with the construction and safety standards of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD ). Our factories employ high volume production techniques that allow us to produce, on average, approximately 70 home sections, or 60 fully completed homes depending on product mix, in total per week. We use quality materials and operate our own component manufacturing facilities for many of the items used in the construction of our homes. Each home can be configured according to a variety of floor plans and equipped with features such as fireplaces, central air conditioning and state of the art kitchens. Our homes are marketed under our premier Legacy brand name and, as of September 30, 2024, are sold to consumers, primarily in over 15 states through a network of independent retail locations, 13 company owned retail locations and through direct sales to owners of manufactured home communities. Our 13 company owned retail locations, including 11 Heritage Housing stores and two Tiny House Outlet stores, exclusively sell our homes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 48 of our manufactured homes were sold in Texas, followed by 9 in North Carolina, 9 in Georgia, 8 in Oklahoma, 3 in Michigan and 3 in Florida. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 49 of our manufactured homes were sold in Texas, followed by 15 in Georgia, 9 in Louisiana, 4 in Oklahoma, and 3 in Florida. We offer three types of financing solutions to our customers. We provide consumer financing for our products which are sold to end users through both independent and company owned retail locations. We provide inventory financing for our independent retailers who purchase homes from us and then sell them to consumers. We also provide financing solutions to manufactured housing community owners that buy our products for use in their manufactured housing communities. Our ability to offer competitive financing options at our retail locations provides us with several

Table of Contents 
 competitive advantages and allows us to capture sales which may not have otherwise occurred without our ability to offer consumer financing. Factors Affecting Our Performance We believe that the growth of our business and our future success depend on various opportunities, challenges, trends and other factors, including the following: We have acquired several properties in our market area for the purpose of developing manufactured housing communities and subdivisions. As of September 30, 2024, these properties include the following (dollars in thousands): 

Location Description Date of Acquisition Land Improvements Total Bastrop County, Texas 368 Acres April 2018 4,215 15,025 19,240 Bexar County, Texas 69 Acres November 2018 842 138 980 Horseshoe Bay, Texas 39 Acres Various 2018-2019 1,222 2,153 3,375 Johnson County, Texas 91.5 Acres July 2019 449 - 449 Venus, Texas 50 Acres August 2019 422 52 474 Wise County, Texas 81.5 Acres September 2020 889 - 889 Bexar County, Texas 233 Acres February 2021 1,550 488 2,038 Richland, Mississippi (1) 22 Acres February, 2024 1,141 - 1,141 Beaumont, Texas (1) 46 Acres August, 2024 6,100 - 6,100 16,830 17,856 34,686 (1) Land and improvement values for Richland and Beaumont properties do not include the value of Company owned homes located in these communities. 
 We also expect to provide financing solutions to owners of manufactured housing communities in a manner that includes developing new sites for products in or near urban locations where there is a shortage of sites to place our products. These solutions will be structured to give us an attractive return on investment and competitive the gross margins on the sale of homes to these new manufactured housing communities . Inflation recently was near its highest rate in the U.S. over the last 30 years. Our ability to maintain gross margins can be impacted adversely by sudden increases in specific costs, such as increases in material and labor. In addition, measures used to combat inflation, such as increases in interest rates, could also have an impact on the ability of home buyers and community developers to obtain affordable financing. We continue to explore opportunities to minimize the impact of inflation on our future profitability. Finally, our financial performance will be impacted by our ability to fulfill orders for our manufactured homes from dealers and customers. Our Georgia manufacturing facility has unutilized space available and, with additional investment, we can add capacity to increase the number of homes that we can manufacture in that facility. Our future levels of production will depend in part, on our ability to anticipate sales volumes and product mix, to schedule production efficiently, to maintain proper equipment and to manage levels of inventory and personnel. We actively review organic and inorganic opportunities to add production capacity in attractive regions to meet future demand.

Product sales decreased 6.8 million, or 18.5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was driven by a decrease in unit volumes shipped, primarily in direct sales, mobile home park sales and inventory finance sales categories. Net revenue attributable to our factory-built housing consisted of the following during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Net revenue: Product Sales 30,169 37,008 (6,839) (18.5) Total units sold 475 582 (107) (18.4) Net revenue per unit sold 63.5 63.6 (0) (0.1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , our net revenue per product sold did not change significantly as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. We had decreases in direct sales, commercial sales, inventory finance sales and other product sales, partially offset by an increase in retail store sales. Direct sales decreased 0.5 million, or 19.7 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Commercial sales decreased 1.6 million, or 11.2 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Inventory finance sales to dealers decreased 4.7 million, or 37.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Retail store sales increased 0.3 million, or 4.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Our revenue has decreased 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 primarily due to a lower volume of shipments, a shift in product mix generally to smaller units and a slowdown in our dealer and mobile home park sales. Our current business is dependent on dealer sales, as reflected in direct sales and inventory finance sales, and our sales have slowed due to high levels of inventory on dealer lots. Our retail sales have improved as we have focused on the performance of our company owned stores. Our mobile home park business has been impacted by higher interest rates, and transaction volumes and new development have declined. Consumer, MHP and dealer loans interest income increased 1.5 million, or 17.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to growth in our loan portfolios. Between September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 our consumer loan portfolio increased by 15.6 million, our MHP loan portfolio increased by 22.0 million, and our dealer finance notes decreased by 0.7 million. Other revenue primarily consists of contract deposit forfeitures, consignment fees, commercial lease rents, land sales, service fees and other miscellaneous income and decreased 0.4 million, or 8.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 2.4 million decrease in forfeited deposits and a 1.0 million decrease in dealer finance fees, partially offset by a 2.7 million increase in land sales and a 0.3 million increase in other miscellaneous revenue. The cost of product sales decreased 3.5 million, or 13.9 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in costs is primarily related to the decrease in units sold. The cost of other sales increased 2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in costs is due to the sale of land. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained flat compared to the same period in 2023. We had a 0.6 million increase in payroll and healthcare expense, a 0.2 million increase in marketing expense, a 0.1 million increase in other miscellaneous expense offset by a 0.3 million decrease in warranty expense, a 0.2 million decrease in loan loss provision and a 0.2 million decrease in bad debt expense and a 0.2 million decrease in professional fees. Dealer incentive expense decreased 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Other income (expense) increased 3.5 million, or 781.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. We had (i) a decrease of 0.8 million decrease in Non-operating interest income primarily as a result of the Settlement Agreement described in Note 4, Notes Receivable from Mobile Home Parks, in these Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, (ii) an increase of 3.9 million in income in Miscellaneous, net also primarily as a result of the Settlement Agreement above, (iii) an increase of 0.4 million in income Miscellaneous, net due to a gain on conversion of inventory finance loans, (iv) a decrease of 0.1 million in Interest expense and (v) an increase of 0.1 million in expense in Miscellaneous, net related to other expenses. Income tax increased 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 18.2 and 17.4 , respectively, and differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a federal tax credit for energy efficient construction, partially offset by state income taxes.

Product sales decreased 29.9 million, or 24.4 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was driven by a decrease in unit volumes shipped, primarily in direct sales, mobile home park sales and inventory finance sales categories. Net revenue attributable to our factory-built housing consisted of the following during nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Net revenue: Product Sales 92,653 122,505 (29,852) (24.4) Total units sold 1,536 1,948 (412) (21.1) Net revenue per unit sold 60.3 62.9 (2.6) (4.1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net revenue per product sold decreased primarily due to a shift in product mix to smaller units and to a large sale of homes in the first quarter of 2024 from our leased home portfolio to a mobile home park customer at a lower than average price than our typical new home. We had decreases in direct sales, commercial sales and inventory finance sales, partially offset by an increase in retail store sales. Direct sales decreased 6.5 million, or 47.4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Commercial sales decreased 8.2 million, or 18.0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Inventory finance sales to dealers decreased 16.4 million, or 39.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Retail store sales increased 1.2 million, or 9.1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Our revenue has decreased primarily due to a lower volume of shipments, a shift in product mix generally to smaller units and a slowdown in our dealer and mobile home park sales. Our current business is dependent on dealer sales, as reflected in direct sales and inventory finance sales, and our sales have slowed due to high levels of inventory on dealer lots and

 seasonality. Our retail sales have improved as we have focused on the performance of our company owned stores. Our mobile home park business has been impacted by higher interest rates, and transaction volumes and new development have declined. Consumer, MHP and dealer loans interest income increased 5.8 million, or 23.2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to growth in our loan portfolios. Between September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 our consumer loan portfolio increased by 15.6 million, our MHP loan portfolio increased by 22.0 million, and our dealer finance notes decreased by 0.7 million. Other revenue primarily consists of contract deposit forfeitures, consignment fees, commercial lease rents, land sales, service fees and other miscellaneous income and decreased 1.4 million, or 17.5 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 2.9 million decrease in dealer finance fees, a 1.3 million decrease in forfeited deposits, partially offset by a 2.7 million increase in land sales and a 0.1 million increase in other miscellaneous revenue. The cost of product sales decreased 20.1 million, or 24.1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in costs is primarily related to the decrease in units sold. The cost of other sales increased 2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in costs is due to the sale of land. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.5 million, or 2.8 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 0.4 million increase in legal expense, a 0.4 million increase in property tax expense, a 0.4 million increase in marketing expense, a 0.1 million increase in payroll and related expense, and a net 0.4 million increase in other miscellaneous expense partially offset by a 1.0 million decrease in warranty costs and a 0.2 million decrease in loan loss provision. Dealer incentive expense decreased 1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Other income (expense) increased 7.1 million, or 296.7 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. We had (i) 0.2 million increase in Non-operating interest income, (ii) a 0.8 million increase in income in Miscellaneous, net as a result of a gain on the sales of real property, (iii) a 1.3 million increase in income in Miscellaneous, net due to a reversal of accrued liabilities, (iv) an increase of 1.1 million in income Miscellaneous, net due to a gain on conversion of inventory finance loans, (v) 0.1 million increase in Interest expense and (vi) a 3.8 million net increase in income in Miscellaneous, net partially as a result of the Settlement Agreement described above,. Income tax increased 0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 18.2 and 17.3 , respectively, and differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a federal tax credit for energy efficient construction, partially offset by state income taxes.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity We believe that cash flow from operations and cash at September 30, 2024, and availability on our lines of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and provide for growth for the next 12 to 18 months and into the foreseeable future. On July 28, 2023, we terminated our credit agreement with Capital One, N.A. and entered into a new credit agreement with Prosperity Bank that expanded and extended our credit availability (see Lines of Credit , below). Cash We maintain cash balances in bank accounts that may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. We have not incurred any losses from such accounts, and management considers the risk of loss to be minimal. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 0.6 million in cash, compared to 0.7 million as of December 31, 2023. We consider all cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash Flow Activities 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 28,100 (5,284) Net cash (used in) investing activities (1,511) (7,556) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (26,767) 10,568 Net change in cash (178) (2,272) Cash at beginning of period 748 2,819 Cash at end of period 570 547 Comparison of Cash Flow Activities from September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities was 28.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash of 5.3 million used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was predominantly the result of decreased MHP loan originations net of collections, decreased consumer loan originations net of collections, and decreased dealer inventory loan originations net of collections. Net cash used in investing activities of 1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to 5.8 million of collections of loans we made to third parties for the development of manufactured housing parks, 1.6 million in proceeds from the sale of property and 0.1 million in proceeds from collections of purchased loans, offset by 7.3 million used in improvements and development of property, plant and equipment and 1.7 million used to issue notes to third parties for the development of manufactured housing parks. Net cash used in investing activities of 7.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to 13.9 million used to issue notes to third parties for the development of manufactured housing parks, 4.6 million used in improvements and development of property, plant and equipment, offset by 8.5 million received from the sale of treasury notes, 1.1 million received from the sale of leases homes, 1.0 million of collections of loans we made to third parties for the development of manufactured housing parks and 0.3 million of collections from other purchased loans. Net cash used in financing activities of 26.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to net payments of 21.6 million on our lines of credit, 5.4 million of stock repurchases and 0.2 million received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities of 10.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to net proceeds of 10.5 million on our lines of credit and 0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options. In November 2022, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 10.0 million of the Company s common stock. We repurchased 1,001 shares for 0.02 million in the open market

 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and we repurchased 262,530 shares for 5.4 million in the open market during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had a remaining authorization of approximately 14.6 million. On August 6, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 10.0 million of the Company s common stock under the share repurchase program. Lines of Credit On July 28, 2023, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Revolver ), by and among the Company as borrower, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as lenders, and Prosperity Bank as administrative agent. Subsequently, the Company repaid in full the balance due on its prior line of credit with Capital One, N.A. and all commitments under this prior line of credit were terminated. The Revolver provides for a four-year senior secured revolving credit facility with an initial commitment of 50,000 and an additional 25,000 commitment under an accordion feature. The Revolver is secured by the Company s consumer loans receivables and all escrow accounts associated with the consumer loans receivables. At the Company s option, borrowings will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, (i) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.5 or 2.75 based upon the Company s average quarterly borrowings under the Revolver or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.5 or 2.75 based upon the Company s average quarterly borrowings under the Revolver. The Company paid certain arrangement fees and other fees in connection with the Revolver of approximately 271, which were capitalized as unamortized debt issuance costs and included within lines of credit balance in the accompanying balance sheets and are amortized to interest expense over the life of the Revolver. The Revolver matures July 28, 2027. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense under the Revolver was 175, and for the three months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense under the Revolver and prior line of credit was 302. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense under the Revolver was 686, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense under the Revolver and prior line of credit was 588. The outstanding balance of the Revolver as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 2,111 and 23,680, respectively. The interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for the Revolver was 7.61 and 7.95 , respectively. The amount of available credit under the Revolver was 47,889 and 26,320 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Revolver requires the Company to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants, including that it maintain a maximum leverage ratio of no more than 1.00 to 1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.75 to 1.00.

 Contractual Obligations The following table is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2024: 

Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Total 2024 2025 - 2026 2027 - 2028 After 2028 Lines of credit 2,111 2,111 Operating lease obligations 1,540 125 925 490 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, net sales, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures. However, we do have a repurchase agreement with a financial institution that provides inventory financing for independent retailers of our products. Under this agreement, we have agreed to repurchase homes at declining prices over the term of the agreement (24 months). Our obligation under this repurchase agreement ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately 856 and 3,030 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense as a consequence of these repurchase agreements. We consider our obligations on current contracts to be immaterial, and accordingly, we have not recorded any reserve for repurchase commitment as of September 30, 2024. Critical Accounting Estimates Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates are identified and described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 Nature of Operations, Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our September 30, 2024 Condensed Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited), of this Quarterly Report. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company s status as an emerging growth company ended on December 31, 2023. An emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act, provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act which requires designing disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. In light of the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures are considered ineffective as of September 30, 2024, we have applied procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting in regard to this quarterly report. Accordingly, the Company believes, based on its knowledge, that: (i) this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; and (ii) the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this quarterly report. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As previously disclosed in our Annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023 we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the preparation of our financial statements. Under standards established by the PCAOB, a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses in financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 are summarized as follows: We determined that we have not sufficiently or adequately designed or implemented control activities and have a lack of documentation, review and approval of certain control activities. Additionally, those activities are not sufficiently monitored and tested; We determined that we do not have sufficient qualified accounting personnel to support the preparation of financial statements that are in compliance with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements; and We determined that we have not sufficiently or adequately designed or implemented information technology general controls over in-scope business processes and financial reporting systems. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls, will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors, mistakes or fraud. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals or groups of persons or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements in our public reports due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. . PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
