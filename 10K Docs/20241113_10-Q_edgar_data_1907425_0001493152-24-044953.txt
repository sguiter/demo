and capital deficiency of . These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements
are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a
going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the
Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

Major suppliers 

For

and the accounts payable balances at period-end. 

(c)
Credit risk 

Financial
instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the concentration
of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection
terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful
accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. 

(d)
Exchange rate risk 

The
Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain stable, therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post
the same amount of income for two comparable periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower income
depending on exchange rate of RM converted to US on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in political and
economic environments without notice.

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item. 

ITEM
4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure
controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our chief executive
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i)
lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
(ii) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines; and (iv) lack of internal
audit function due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the
scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet to be developed. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified
by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
