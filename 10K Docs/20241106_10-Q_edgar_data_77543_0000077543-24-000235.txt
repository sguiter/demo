 Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings: Claims Unapproved change orders Other unbilled costs and profits Total costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings Capitalized contract costs Total contract assets 
 Retention receivable represents amounts invoiced to customers where payments have been partially withheld pending the completion of certain milestones, satisfaction of other contractual conditions or the completion of the project. Retention agreements vary from project to project, and balances could be outstanding for several months or years depending on a number of circumstances such as contract-specific terms, project performance and other variables that may arise as the Company makes progress toward completion. 
 Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represent the excess of contract costs and profits (or contract revenue) over the amount of contract billings to date and are classified as a current asset. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings result when either: (1) the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized over time in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract, or (2) costs are incurred related to certain claims and unapproved change orders. Claims occur when there is a dispute regarding both a change in the scope of work and the price associated with that change. Unapproved change orders occur when a change in the scope of work results in additional work being performed before the parties have agreed on the corresponding change in the contract price. The Company routinely estimates recovery related to claims and unapproved change orders as a form of variable consideration at the most likely amount it expects to receive and to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Claims and unapproved change orders are billable upon the agreement and resolution between the contractual parties and after the execution of contractual amendments. Increases in claims and unapproved change orders typically result from costs being incurred against existing or new positions; decreases normally result from resolutions and subsequent billings. As discussed in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies , the resolution of these claims and unapproved change orders may require litigation or other forms of dispute resolution proceedings. Other unbilled costs and profits are billable in accordance with the billing terms of each of the existing contractual arrangements and, as such, the timing of contract billing cycles can cause fluctuations in the balance of unbilled costs and profits. Ultimate resolution of other unbilled costs and profits typically involves incremental progress toward contractual requirements or milestones. The amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings as of September 30, 2024 estimated by management to be collected beyond one year is approximately million. 
 Capitalized contract costs are included in other current assets and primarily represent costs to fulfill a contract that (1) directly relate to an existing or anticipated contract, (2) generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and (3) are expected to be recovered through the contract. Capitalized contract costs are generally e xpense d to the associated contract over the period of anticipated use on the project. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, of previously capitalized contract costs were amortized and recognized as expense on the related contracts. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, million and million, respectively, of previously capitalized contract costs were amortized and recognized as expense on the related contracts.

Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings Total contract liabilities 
 Retention payable represents amounts invoiced to the Company by subcontractors where payments have been partially withheld pending the completion of certain milestones, other contractual conditions or upon the completion of the project. Generally, retention payable is not remitted to subcontractors until the associated retention receivable from customers is collected. 
 Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represent the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits (or contract revenue) recognized to date. The balance may fluctuate depending on the timing of contract billings and the recognition of contract revenue. Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and included in the opening billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings balances for each period totale d million and million, respectively. Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and included in the opening billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings balances for each period totaled million and million, respectively.

 Joint venture cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents Restricted cash Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired. Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts available for the Company s general purposes, the Company s proportionate share of cash held by the Company s unconsolidated joint ventures and 100 of amounts held by the Company s consolidated joint ventures. In both cases, cash held by joint ventures is available only for joint venture-related uses, including future distributions to joint venture partners. 
 Restricted cash includes amounts primarily held as collateral to secure insurance-related contingent obligations, such as insurance claim deductibles, in lieu of letters of credit.

 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rates for both periods were impacted by relatively large tax benefits generated against a forecasted pre-tax loss for the year, which magnified the impact these tax benefits had on the effective income tax rate. In periods with pre-tax losses, tax benefits generated during the period increase the effective income tax rate (and, thus, the income tax benefit to the Company) rather than decreasing the effective rate, as in periods with pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the 21.0 federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (for which income taxes are not the responsibility of the Company) and state income taxes (net of the federal tax benefit), partially offset by non-deductible expenses. 
 The Company rec ognized an income tax benefit of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the 21.0 federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of a cumulative catch-up adjustment associated with the change in the Company s projected 2023 effective tax rate that resulted from the revision of the Company s forecast. The effective income tax rates for both periods were impacted by relatively large tax benefits generated against a forecasted pre-tax loss for the year, which magnified the impact these tax benefits had on the effective income tax rate. In periods with pre-tax losses, tax benefits generated during the period increase the effective income tax rate (and, thus, the income tax benefit to the Company) rather than decreasing the effective rate, as in periods with pre-tax income. The tax benefits that caused a higher effective tax rate were primarily state income taxes (net of the federal tax benefit), earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (for which income taxes are not the responsibility of the Company) and a reduction in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by non-deductible expenses.

 The Company performed its annual impairment test for non-amortizable trade names during the fourth quarter of 2023. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that its non-amortizable trade names were not impaired. In addition, the Company determined that no triggering events occurred and no circumstances changed since the date of its annual impairment test that would indicate impairment of its non-amortizable trade names. Other amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the future cash flows generated by the assets might be less than the assets net carrying value.

 On April 15, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment in respect of the 2020 Credit Agreement (the 2024 Amendment which, among other changes, (1) extends the existing Revolver maturity date from August 18, 2025 to (a) if any tranche of the Term Loan B, any incremental term loan or any refinancing term loan (or any refinancing or replacement thereof) remains outstanding, the earlier of (i) May 20, 2027 and (ii) the date that is ninety ) days prior to the final maturity of any tranche of the Term Loan B, any incremental term loan or any refinancing term loan (or any refinancing or replacement thereof), as applicable, and (b) if no obligations are outstanding with respect to any tranche of the Term Loan B, any incremental term loan or any refinancing term loan, August 18, 2027 and (2) permanently reduces the aggregate commitments in respect of the Revolver by million from million to million. The 2024 Amendment became effective on May 2, 2024 upon the completion of the 2017 Senior Notes Redemption. 
 The 2020 Credit Agreement permits the Company to repay any or all borrowings outstanding under the 2020 Credit Agreement at any time prior to maturity without penalty. The 2020 Credit Agreement requires the Company to make regularly scheduled payments of principal on the Term Loan B in quarterly installments equal to of the initial principal amount of the Term Loan B. The 2020 Credit Agreement also requires the Company to make prepayments on the Term Loan B in connection with certain asset sales, receipts of insurance proceeds, incurrences of certain indebtedness and annual excess cash flow (in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions). At December 31, 2023, current maturities of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet included million prepayment of principal on the Term Loan B, relating to the mandatory prepayment provision of the 2020 Credit Agreement in respect of annual excess cash flow. The million prepayment included in current maturities at December 31, 2023, which was due by the first week of April 2024, was paid in February 2024.

interest in STP. 
 The construction of the large-diameter bored tunnel required the use of a tunnel boring machine TBM ). In December 2013, the TBM struck a steel pipe, installed by WSDOT as a well casing for an exploratory well. The TBM was significantly damaged and was required to be repaired. STP asserted that the steel pipe casing was a differing site condition that WSDOT failed to properly disclose. The Disputes Review Board mandated by the contract to hear disputes issued a decision finding the steel casing was a Type I (material) differing site condition. WSDOT did not accept that finding. 
 The TBM was insured under a Builder s Risk Insurance Policy (the Policy with Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK) PLC and a consortium of other insurers (the Insurers ). STP submitted the claims to the Insurers and requested interim payments under the Policy. The Insurers refused to pay and denied coverage. In June 2015, STP filed a lawsuit in the King County Superior Court, State of Washington seeking declaratory relief concerning contract interpretation, as well as damages as a result of the Insurers breach of their obligations under the terms of the Policy. STP also asserted extra-contractual and statutory claims against the Insurers. 
 In April and September 2018, rulings received on pre-trial motions limited some of the potential recoveries under the Policy for STP, WSDOT and Hitachi. On August 2, 2021, the Court of Appeals reversed in part certain of those limitations but affirmed other parts of those rulings. On September 15, 2022, the Washington Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals, which limited recovery of certain damages under the Policy. Based on the rulings of the Court of Appeals, the case was continued for adjudication on the remaining facts and legal issues, including the number of covered occurrences which could increase the amount of available coverage under the Policy and the amount of investigative costs that are subject to the Policy limits. STP advanced damages to the Insurers in the King County lawsuit in the amount of million, plus million in interest, plus attorney fees and costs, plus STP s supplier, Hitachi Zosen Hitachi ), the manufacturer of the TBM, sought million in insurance proceeds. On September 30, 2024, a confidential settlement was reached resolving the case in full for a substantial sum. Payment was received in October 2024 and the case was dismissed. 
 In addition, STP has a pending case in the Washington Superior Court against HNTB Corporation HNTB ), STP s design firm on the project, wherein STP alleges that HNTB is liable for providing design services that resulted in the TBM striking the steel pipe described above and for additional steel quantity costs associated with the project. Due to the resolution of the matter against the Insurers discussed above, STP s current complaint against HNTB seeking in excess of million is expected to be reduced to reflect only the remaining damages being sought. The case is scheduled for trial to commence on July 14, 2025. With respect to STP s claims against HNTB, management has included in receivables an estimate of the total anticipated recovery concluded to be probable. 
 In March 2016, WSDOT filed a complaint against STP in Thurston County Superior Court alleging breach of contract, seeking million in delay-related damages and seeking declaratory relief concerning contract interpretation. STP subsequently filed a counterclaim against WSDOT seeking the same damages in excess of million. The jury trial between STP and WSDOT commenced on October 7, 2019 and concluded on December 13, 2019, with a jury verdict in favor of WSDOT awarding them million in damages. The Company recorded the impact of the jury verdict during the fourth quarter of 2019, resulting in a pre-tax charge of million, which included million for the Company s proportionate share of the million in damages awarded by the jury to WSDOT. The charge was for non-cash write-downs primarily related to the costs and

 The unrealized losses in AFS debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are primarily attributable to market interest rate increases and not a deterioration in credit quality of the issuers. Management evaluated the unrealized losses in AFS debt securities considering factors including credit ratings and other relevant information, which may indicate that contractual cash flows are not expected to occur. Based on the analysis, management determined that credit losses did not exist for AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 It is not considered likely that the Company will be required to sell the investments before full recovery of the amortized cost basis of the AFS debt securities, which may be at maturity. As a result, consistent with the same period in 2023, the Company has not recognized any impairment losses in earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

During the third quarter of 2023, the Company reached a settlement that impacted multiple components of a Civil segment mass-transit project in California, which included the resolution of certain ongoing disputes and increased the expected profit from work to be performed in the future. The settlement resulted in an unfavorable non-cash adjustment of million million after tax, or per diluted share) to one component of the project that is nearing completion, partially offset by a favorable adjustment of million million after tax, or per diluted share) on the other component of the project that has substantial scope of work remaining. As a result of the settlement, the net unfavorable impact to the period from these two adjustments is expected to be mitigated by the increased profit generated from future work on the project. ) ) ) Other income, net Interest expense ) ) ) ) Loss before income taxes

 Executive Overview 
 Operating Results 
 Consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 billion, up slightly compared to the same period in 2023. Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.3 billion, up 14 compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine-month period of 2024, the growth was primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain Building segment projects, including various healthcare and educational facility projects in California and a detention facility project in New York. The growth was also due to increased project execution activities on various Civil segment projects, including certain mass-transit projects in California, two airport projects in the Northern Mariana Islands and the tunneling component of an energy project in British Columbia, as well as the absence of certain prior-year net unfavorable adjustments, as discussed in more detail below in Results of Segment Operations. The improvement for the nine-month period of 2024 was partially offset by reduced project execution activities on a Civil segment mass-transit project in the Midwest that is nearing completion, as well as certain net unfavorable adjustments in the current-year period, also discussed in more detail below. 
 Loss from construction operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 106.8 million compared to 12.6 million for the same period in 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, the higher loss was primarily due to current-quarter unfavorable adjustments, including 101.6 million related to an unexpected adverse arbitration decision on a legacy dispute related to a completed Civil segment bridge project in California, which the Company will appeal; 20.0 million related to a settlement on a legacy dispute related to a completed Building segment government facility project in Florida; 17.7 million due to an unfavorable judgment on a completed Specialty Contractors segment mass-transit project in California; and 11.5 million due to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a completed Specialty Contractors segment mass-transit project in New York. The higher loss was partially offset by contributions related to increased project execution activities in the Building and Civil segments, an 18.4 million favorable adjustment due to a settlement of a claim associated with a completed Civil segment highway tunneling project in the Western United States and the absence of certain prior-year net unfavorable adjustments, as discussed further below in Results of Segment Operations . 
 Loss from construction operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.5 million compared to 92.1 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine-month period of 2024, the improvement was primarily due to the absence of certain prior-year net unfavorable adjustments, as discussed further below in Results of Segment Operations, contributions totaling 78.5 million related to the increased project execution activities discussed above, and a favorable adjustment of 10.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 on a Civil segment mass-transit project in California related to a dispute resolution and associated expected cost savings. The improvement for the period was partially offset by the impact of the net unfavorable adjustments in the third quarter of 2024 discussed in the paragraph above, an unfavorable adjustment of 12.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 due to the impact of a settlement on two completed Civil segment highway projects in the Northeast, and an unfavorable adjustment of 12.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 due to an arbitration ruling that only provided a partial award to the Company pertaining to a completed Specialty Contractors segment electrical project in New York. 
 Furthermore, loss from construction operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by share-based compensation expense of 16.5 million and 39.0 million, respectively, compared to share-based compensation expense of 3.5 million and 9.1 million for the respective periods in 2023. The increase in share-based compensation expense in both 2024 periods was primarily due to a substantial increase in the Company s stock price throughout the first three quarters of 2024, which impacted the fair value of liability-classified awards. These awards are remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period with the change recognized in earnings.

 The Company generated strong cash from operations in the first nine months of 2024, and as a result of significant progress made in the resolution of various disputed matters, including those discussed above, and cash generation related to project execution activities for new and existing projects, it expects to generate cash flow from operations in the range of 250 million to 400 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 (and, consequently, 425 million to 575 million of anticipated cash flow from operations for the full year of 2024). Cash flow from operations anticipated for the fourth quarter is expected to be driven by collections of approximately 180 million related to the resolution of the above-mentioned third-quarter 2024 settlements, as well as cash generation related to project execution activities for new and existing projects. The wide range in the estimated generation of operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2024 is due to the uncertainty as to the precise timing of when certain large payments will be collected, though any amounts in this range that are not collected in the fourth quarter of 2024 are expected to be collected in the first quarter of 2025. The Company intends to utilize some of the cash flow from operations expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 to prepay 100 million to 150 million of its outstanding Term Loan B debt by the end of 2024, of which 50 million has already been prepaid subsequent to the third quarter of 2024. Further estimated prepayments of 50 million to 75 million of the Term Loan B debt are anticipated in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Income tax benefit was 33.9 million and 19.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.1 million and 52.0 million for the same periods in 2023. See Corporate, Tax and Other Matters below for a discussion of the changes in the effective tax rate. 
 Diluted loss per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.92 and 1.61, respectively, compared to diluted loss per common share of 0.71 and 2.39, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The change for both periods in 2024 was primarily due to the factors discussed above that resulted in the change in loss from construction operations for such periods. 
 Consolidated new awards for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 4.7 billion and 7.1 billion, respectively, compared to 0.8 billion and 5.6 billion for the same periods in 2023. The Civil and Building segments were the primary contributors to the new awards activity in the third quarter of 2024. The most significant new awards and contract adjustments in the third quarter of 2024 included a 1.66 billion mass-transit project in Hawaii; a 1.1 billion water conveyance tunnel project in New York; a healthcare campus project in California valued at more than 1 billion; 138 million of additional funding for certain mass-transit projects in California; and a 113 million military facility project in Guam. 
 
 Consolidated backlog as of September 30, 2024 was 14.0 billion , up 38 compared to 10.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, setting a new all-time record that far exceeded the previous record backlog of 11.6 billion reported for the first quarter of 2019. As of September 30, 2024, the mix of backlog by segment was approximately 49 for Civil, 37 for Building and 14 for Specialty Contractors. The Company has submitted or will submit proposals on various large projects and expects owners decisions in the fourth quarter of 2024. Accordingly, ending backlog for the fourth quarter of 2024 could reflect further significant growth. 
 The following table presents the Company s backlog by business segment, reflecting changes from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024:

 (a) New awards consist of the original contract price of projects added to backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts. 
 (b) Backlog may differ from the transaction prices allocated to the remaining performance obligations as disclosed in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Such differences relate to the timing of executing a formal contract or receiving a notice to proceed. More specifically, backlog may include awards for which a contract has not yet been executed or a notice to proceed has not yet been issued, but for which there are no remaining major uncertainties that we will proceed with our work on the project (e.g., adequate funding is in place, we have received a notice of intent to award a contract, etc.). 
 
 The outlook for the Company s revenue growth over the next several years remains favorable, especially due to strong new award bookings in the third quarter of 2024, as well as other significant awards that could potentially be booked over the next few months. Many of these newer projects will be executed over a longer timeframe compared to other projects booked in

 recent years. However, revenue growth could be hampered by unanticipated project delays or the timing of project bids, awards, commencements, ramp-up activities and completions. We anticipate that we will continue to win our share of significant new project awards resulting from long-term, well-funded capital spending plans by state, local and federal customers, as well as limited competition for many of the larger project opportunities. 
 Since 2014, voters in 43 states have approved 85 percent of over 3,000 state and local ballot measures, raising an estimated 342 billion in new and renewed revenue funding for transportation investments. The largest of these was in Los Angeles County, where Measure M, a half-cent sales tax increase, was approved in 2016 and is expected to generate 120 billion of funding over 40 years. Funding from this measure is supporting, and is expected to continue to support, several of the Company s current and prospective projects. More recently, there were more than 50 billion in various state and local transit funding measures on the ballots for elections in November 2024. Despite numerous interest rate increases since March 2022, rates remain at levels that we believe are conducive to continued spending on certain types of projects that have strong end-market demand with adequate available funding, such as mass transit, transportation, bridges, and healthcare, education, and correctional and detention facilities, among others. For the first time in four years, interest rates were lowered in September 2024, and many economists expect further rate reductions over the remainder of 2024 and in 2025, though the actual timing and extent of any future rate reductions remains uncertain. Lower interest rates could support additional demand for continued infrastructure spending. In contrast, should interest rates rise, they could reach levels that may negatively impact demand, especially for certain types of Building segment projects that have already been experiencing such impacts, such as commercial offices and tenant improvement projects, which tend to be more economically sensitive than projects handled by our Civil segment. 
 The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or BIL ), enacted into law in November 2021, provides for 1.2 trillion of federal infrastructure funding, including 550 billion in new spending for improvements to the country s surface-transportation network and enhancements to core infrastructure. The law initiated the largest federal investment in public transit ever, the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system and the largest federal investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak, all in addition to providing for regular annual spending for numerous infrastructure projects. This significant incremental funding is anticipated to be spent over the 10 years from its enactment through 2031, and much of it is allocated for investment in end markets that are directly aligned with the Company s market focus. Accordingly, the Company believes that this significant level of sustained, incremental funding has benefited, and will continue to favorably impact, the Company s current work and prospective opportunities over the next decade. 
 For a more detailed discussion of the operating performance of each business segment, corporate general and administrative expenses and other items, see Results of Segment Operations , Corporate, Tax and Other Matters and Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 
 Results of Segment Operations 
 The results of our Civil, Building and Specialty Contractors segments are discussed below. 
 Civil Segment 
 Revenue and income (loss) from construction operations for the Civil segment are summarized as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue 545.8 520.5 1,564.5 1,424.5 Income (loss) from construction operations (12.5) 46.9 133.8 170.3 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a net increase in project execution activities driven by certain large mass-transit projects, two airport projects in the Northern Mariana Islands, and the tunneling component of an energy project in British Columbia, partially offset by reduced project execution activities on a mass-transit project in the Midwest that is nearing completion. The increase was also due to the absence of certain prior-year net unfavorable adjustments discussed in the paragraph below. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to contributions from the net increased project execution activities mentioned above. The increase for both periods of 2024 was partially offset by an unfavorable adjustment related to an unexpected adverse arbitration decision on a legacy dispute related to a completed bridge project in California, which the Company will appeal. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 Loss from construction operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.5 million compared to income from construction operations of 46.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a current-quarter unfavorable adjustment of 101.6 million related to an unexpected adverse arbitration decision on a legacy dispute related to the same bridge project in California, which the Company will appeal. The decrease was partially offset by contributions totaling 17.4 million related to the net increase in project execution activities discussed above, an 18.4 million favorable adjustment due to a settlement of a claim associated with a completed highway tunneling project in the Western United States, as well as the absence of prior-year net unfavorable adjustments due to a settlement in 2023 that impacted multiple components of a mass-transit project in California. That settlement resulted in an unfavorable non-cash adjustment in the prior-year period of 23.2 million to one component of the project that was nearing completion, partially offset by a favorable adjustment in the prior-year period of 8.8 million on the other component of the project that had substantial scope of work remaining. 
 Income from construction operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 133.8 million compared to 170.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to the same factors discussed above for the third quarter of 2024, as well as an unfavorable adjustment of 12.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 that was due to the impact of a settlement on two completed highway projects in the Northeast, mostly offset by a 10.2 million favorable adjustment in the first quarter of 2024 on a mass-transit project in California related to a dispute resolution and associated expected cost savings. The decrease was also due to the absence of prior-year net favorable adjustments totaling 25.6 million on a mass-transit project in California associated with changes in estimates due to improved performance, partially offset by contributions totaling 57.7 million related to the net increase in project execution activities discussed above and the absence of the Civil segment s portion of prior-year unfavorable adjustments of 13.8 million on a completed transportation project in the Northeast due to the settlement of certain change orders during project closeout. 
 Operating margin was (2.3) and 8.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 9.0 and 12.0 for the same periods in 2023. The changes in operating margin were principally due to the above-mentioned factors that drove the changes in revenue and income (loss) fr om construction operations. 
 New awards in the Civil segment totaled 3.1 billion and 4.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 469.0 million and 1.5 billion for the same periods in 2023. The most significant new awards and contract adjustments in the third quarter of 2024 included a 1.66 billion mass-transit project in Hawaii; a 1.1 billion water conveyance tunnel project in New York; 138 million of additional funding for certain mass-transit projects in California; and a 113 million military facility project in Guam. 
 Backlog for the Civil segment was 6.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 , up 52 compared to 4.5 billion as of September 30, 2023. The segment continues to experience strong demand reflected in a large, multi-year pipeline of prospective projects, supported by substantial anticipated funding from various voter-approved transportation measures, the BIL, and by public agencies long-term spending plans. We believe that the Civil segment is well-positioned to capture its share of these prospective projects. 
 Building Segment 
 Revenue and income (loss) from construction operations for the Building segment are summarized as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue 435.8 365.4 1,265.6 926.4 Income (loss) from construction operations (3.9) 0.1 17.3 (83.9) 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 19 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased project execution activities on various healthcare and educational facility projects in California and a detention facility project in New York. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 37 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to contributions from the increased project execution activities mentioned above, as well as the absence of a prior-year unfavorable adjustment related to an adverse legal ruling on a completed mixed-use project in New York. The increase for both periods of 2024 was partially offset by an unfavorable adjustment in the third quarter of 2024 related to a settlement on a legacy dispute related to a completed government facility project in Florida. 
 Loss from construction operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.9 million and income from construction operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.3 million, compared to income from construction operations of 0.1 million and loss from construction operations of 83.9 million for the respective periods in 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, the decrease was primarily the result of an unfavorable adjustment of 20.0 million related 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 to the same settlement on a legacy dispute related to a completed government facility project in Florida, mostly offset by the increased project execution activities discussed above, as well as the absence of the Building segment s portion of a prior-year unfavorable adjustment of 7.0 million on a completed transportation project in the Northeast due to the settlement of certain change orders during project closeout. For the first nine months of 2024, the significant improvement was principally due to the absence of the aforementioned prior-year unfavorable adjustment related to the adverse legal ruling on a completed mixed-use project in New York that resulted in a non-cash charge of 83.6 million, of which 72.2 million impacted the Building segment, and contributions related to the increased current-year project execution activities discussed above. The improvement was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the aforementioned settlement on a legacy dispute related to a completed government facility project in Florida. 
 Operating margin was (0.9) and 1.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.0 and (9.1) for the same periods in 2023. The changes in operating margin were principally due to the aforementioned factors that drove the changes in revenue and income (loss) from construction operations. 
 New awards in the Building segment totaled 1.4 billion and 2.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 249.0 million and 3.0 billion for the same periods in 2023. The nine-month period of 2023 included the award of the Brooklyn Jail project in New York. The most significant new awards and contract adjustments in the third quarter of 2024 included more than 1 billion of additional funding for a healthcare campus project in California. Certain Building segment end markets, such as correctional and detention facilities, healthcare, education, industrial/manufacturing, and hospitality and gaming, continue to show strong demand for new and renovated facilities. However, the proliferation of remote and hybrid work settings at many companies, along with continued higher interest rates, could continue to result in delayed or even canceled Building segment project opportunities, particularly in the corporate office end market. 
 Backlog for the Building segment was 5.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, the highest backlog for the segment since 2008 , and up 18 compared to 4.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. We believe that the Building segment continues to experience strong customer demand as reflected by a large volume of prospective projects across various end markets and geographic locations. In addition, there are various healthcare and education projects underway in California that are in the pre-construction phase, with only a relatively modest amount of our current backlog represented by those projects. Over the next one to two years, these projects are expected to advance into the construction phase, and subsequently we anticipate that we will book significant additional backlog for these projects as a result. 
 Specialty Contractors Segment 
 Revenue and loss from construction operations for the Specialty Contractors segment are summarized as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue 101.2 174.8 429.2 507.9 Loss from construction operations (56.9) (38.4) (83.1) (120.7) 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 42 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to reduced project execution activities on various electrical and mechanical projects in New York and Florida, all of which are complete or nearing completion. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the same factors discussed above for the third quarter, as well as reduced project execution activities on an industrial facility project in Arizona. The decrease for the first nine months of 2024 was partially offset by the absence of certain prior-year unfavorable adjustments described in the paragraph below. 
 Loss from construction operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 56.9 million compared to 38.4 million for the same period in 2023. The higher loss was primarily due to unfavorable adjustments that totaled 43.4 million in the aggregate on several completed projects due to the impact of judgments and settlements, including 17.7 million related to an unfavorable judgment on a completed mass-transit project in California, 11.5 million related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a completed mass-transit project in New York, and certain other adjustments that were individually immaterial, as well as the reduced project execution activities discussed above. The higher loss was partially offset by the absence of certain prior-year unfavorable adjustments, including 16.9 million due to changes in estimates on the electrical and mechanical scope of a transportation project in the Northeast and a 9.4 million unfavorable adjustment due to a settlement on a completed mass-transit project in California. 
 Loss from construction operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 83.1 million compared to 120.7 million for the same period in 2023. The improvement was primarily due to the absence of certain prior-year

 unfavorable adjustments, including 57.0 million due to changes in estimates on the electrical and mechanical scope of the above-mentioned transportation project in the Northeast; a non-cash charge of 25.1 million on an educational facilities project in New York that resulted from an adverse court ruling; an adverse legal ruling on a completed mixed-use project in New York that resulted in a non-cash charge of 83.6 million, of which 11.4 million impacted the Specialty Contractors segment; and the aforementioned 9.4 million unfavorable adjustment on a completed mass-transit project in California. The improvement was partially offset by the unfavorable adjustments impacting the third quarter of 2024, reduced project execution activities for the nine-month period of 2024 discussed above and an unfavorable adjustment of 12.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 due to an arbitration ruling pertaining to a completed electrical project in New York that only provided a partial award to the Company. 
 Operating margin was (56.2) and (19.4) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to (22.0) and (23.8) for the same periods in 2023. The changes in operating margin were principally due to the aforementioned factors that drove the changes in revenue and loss from construction operations. 
 New awards in the Specialty Contractors segment totaled 227.8 million and 681.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 128.5 million and 1.0 billion for the same periods in 2023. 
 Backlog for the Specialty Contractors segment was 2.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, up 12 compared to 1.8 billion as of September 30, 2023. The Specialty Contractors segment continues to be primarily focused on servicing the Company s current and prospective large Civil and Building segment projects, particularly in the Northeast and California. We believe that the segment remains well-positioned to capture its share of new projects, leveraging the size and scale of our business units that operate in New York, Texas, Florida and California and the strong reputation held by these business units for high-quality work on large, complex projects. 
 
 Corporate, Tax and Other Matters 
 Corporate General and Administrative Expenses 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses were 32.5 million and 83.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 21.1 million and 56.1 million for the same periods in 2023. The increase in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses, mainly attributable to higher share-based compensation expense. The increase in share-based compensation expense was primarily due to a substantial increase in the Company s stock price during the 2024 periods, which impacted the fair value of liability-classified awards. These awards are remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period with the change recognized in earnings. 
 Other Income, Net, Interest Expense and Income Tax Benefit 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other income, net 4.5 3.0 15.6 12.4 Interest expense (21.2) (20.3) (63.6) (63.8) Income tax benefit 33.9 4.1 19.4 52.0 
 Other income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.5 million and 3.2 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.9 million compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. With the anticipated prepayment of a portion of the outstanding Term Loan B in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources , the Company expects interest expense to decrease in 2025 and beyond. 
 The Company recognized an income tax benefit of 33.9 million and 19.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 27.5 and 29.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rates for both periods were impacted by relatively large tax benefits generated against a forecasted pre-tax loss for the year, which magnified the impact these tax benefits had on the effective income tax rate. In periods with pre-tax losses, tax benefits generated during the period increase the effective income tax rate (and, thus, the income tax benefit to the Company) rather than decreasing the effective rate, as in periods with pre-tax income. 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 The effective income tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the 21.0 federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (for which income taxes are not the responsibility of the Company) and state income taxes (net of the federal tax benefit), partially offset by non-deductible expenses. 
 The Company recognized an income tax benefit of 4.1 million and 52.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate was 13.7 and 36.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the 21.0 federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of a cumulative catch-up adjustment associated with the change in the Company s projected 2023 effective tax rate that resulted from the revision of the Company s forecast. The effective income tax rates for both periods were impacted by relatively large tax benefits generated against a forecasted pre-tax loss for the year, which magnified the impact these tax benefits had on the effective income tax rate. In periods with pre-tax losses, tax benefits generated during the period increase the effective income tax rate (and, thus, the income tax benefit to the Company) rather than decreasing the effective rate, as in periods with pre-tax income. The tax benefits that caused a higher effective tax rate were primarily state income taxes (net of the federal tax benefit), earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (for which income taxes are not the responsibility of the Company) and a reduction in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by non-deductible expenses. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, credit facilities and access to capital markets. We have a committed line of credit totaling 170.0 million, which may be used for revolving loans, letters of credit and/or general purposes. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with our unused credit capacity and available cash balances as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund working capital needs and debt maturities for the next 12 months and beyond, as discussed further below in Debt . We generated significant cash from operations in the first nine months of 2024 as discussed below in Cash and Working Capital . As discussed above in Operating Results , we expect cash generated from operations ranging from 250 million to 400 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 (and, consequently, 425 million to 575 million of cash generated from operations for the full year of 2024), expected to be driven by collections of approximately 180 million related to the resolution of the aforementioned third-quarter 2024 settlements, as well as cash generation related to project execution activities for new and existing projects. The wide range in the estimated generation of operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2024 is due to the uncertainty as to the precise timing of when certain large payments will be collected, though any amounts in this range that are not collected in the fourth quarter of 2024 are expected to be collected in the first quarter of 2025. We intend to utilize some of the cash flow from operations expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 to prepay 100 million to 150 million of our outstanding Term Loan B debt by the end of 2024, of which 50 million has already been prepaid subsequent to the third quarter of 2024. Further estimated prepayments of 50 million to 75 million of the Term Loan B debt are anticipated in the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we expect to benefit from the utilization of available net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our cash outflows for income taxes. 
 Cash and Working Capital 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 287.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 380.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash immediately available for general corporate purposes was 118.4 million and 145.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with the remainder being amounts held by our consolidated joint ventures and also our proportionate share of cash held by our unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash held by our joint ventures is available only for joint venture-related uses, including distributions to joint venture partners. In addition, our restricted cash and restricted investments totaled 149.5 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 144.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Restricted cash and restricted investments at September 30, 2024 were primarily held to secure insurance-related contingent obligations and deposits. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 174.0 million. The net cash provided by operating activities for the 2024 period was primarily due to cash generated by earnings sources and a reduction in net project working capital. The reduction in net project working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, as a result of the timing of payments to subcontractors and vendors, and a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings CIE ), partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings BIE ). As of September 30, 2024, BIE of 1.05 billion exceeded CIE of 966.3 million resulting in a net BIE position for the first time since 2011. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 180.8 million, which was the second-largest result for the first nine months of any year since the merger between Tutor-Saliba Corporation and Perini Corporation in 2008. The net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period of 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in investments in project working capital, partially offset by cash utilized 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 by earnings sources. The decrease in investments in project working capital was primarily due to a decrease in CIE, an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments to suppliers and subcontractors and an increase in BIE. 
 Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 6.8 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily reflects a smaller reduction in net project working capital in the current period compared to the prior-year period, mostly offset by cash generated by earning sources in the current period compared to cash used by earnings sources in the same period last year. The smaller reduction in net project working capital in the 2024 period was primarily due to a current-year increase in accounts receivable compared to a decrease last year, a current-year decrease in BIE compared to an increase last year, and a smaller current-year decrease in CIE compared to last year, partially offset by a larger current-year increase in accounts payable compared to last year. Both periods were positively impacted by collections associated with previously disputed matters. 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 27.3 million primarily due to the acquisition of property and equipment for projects (i.e., capital expenditures) totaling 28.3 million and net cash used in investment transactions of 2.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 2.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2023 was 43.4 million primarily due to the acquisition of property and equipment for projects totaling 45.6 million, as well as net cash used in investment transactions of 6.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 9.0 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 240.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, which was primarily driven by a 199.3 million net repayment of debt (including the 2024 Senior Notes issuance of 400.0 million and the 2017 Senior Notes redemption of 500.0 million, as well as the 91.0 million principal prepayment on the Term Loan B, all of which are discussed below in Debt ), 25.1 million of payments for debt issuance costs related to debt transactions during the period and 12.3 million of net distributions to noncontrolling interests. Net cash used in financing activities was 79.3 million for the first nine months of 2023, which was primarily driven by a 56.0 million net repayment of debt and 22.0 million of net distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 1.2 billion, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.55 and a ratio of debt to equity of 0.55, compared to working capital of 1.4 billion, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.66 and a ratio of debt to equity of 0.70 at December 31, 2023. 
 Debt 
 2024 Senior Notes Issuance and 2017 Senior Notes Redemption 
 On April 22, 2024, the Company issued 400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.875 Senior Notes due April 30, 2029 (the 2024 Senior Notes in a private placement offering. Interest on the 2024 Senior Notes is payable in arrears semi-annually in April and October of each year, beginning in October 2024. 
 Prior to April 30, 2026, the Company may redeem the 2024 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium described in the indenture. In addition, prior to April 30, 2026, the Company may redeem up to 40 of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 111.875 of their principal amount with the net cash proceeds received by the Company from one or more equity offerings, as described in the indenture. On or after April 30, 2026, the Company may redeem the 2024 Senior Notes at specified redemption prices described in the indenture. If the Company experiences certain change of control events, holders of the 2024 Senior Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of the 2024 Senior Notes at 101 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 
 The 2024 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by the Company s existing and future subsidiaries that also guarantee obligations under the Company s 2020 Credit Agreement. In addition, the indenture for the 2024 Senior Notes provides for customary covenants and includes customary events of default. 
 The proceeds of the 2024 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem in full, all of the outstanding obligations in respect of the 2017 Senior Notes. The redemption of the 2017 Senior Notes occurred on May 2, 2024 (the 2017 Senior Notes Redemption ). 
 2020 Credit Agreement 
 On August 18, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the 2020 Credit Agreement with BMO Bank N.A. (f/k/a BMO Harris Bank N.A.), as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer and other lenders. The 2020 Credit Agreement originally provided for a 425.0 million term loan B facility (the Term Loan B and a 175.0 million 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 revolving credit facility (the Revolver ), which was subsequently reduced to 170.0 million following the effectiveness of the 2024 Amendment (as defined and discussed below), with sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and swing line loans up to the aggregate amounts of 75.0 million and 10.0 million, respectively. Prior to the 2017 Senior Notes Redemption, if any of the 2017 Senior Notes had remained outstanding beyond certain dates, the maturities of the Term Loan B and the Revolver would have been subject to acceleration spring-forward maturity ). However, following the 2017 Senior Notes Redemption and the consummation of the 2024 Amendment, the spring-forward maturity of the Term Loan B is no longer in effect and the spring-forward maturity of the Revolver has been extended (as described below). 
 On April 15, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment in respect of the 2020 Credit Agreement (the 2024 Amendment which, among other changes, (1) extends the existing Revolver maturity date from August 18, 2025 to (a) if any tranche of the Term Loan B, any incremental term loan or any refinancing term loan (or any refinancing or replacement thereof) remains outstanding, the earlier of (i) May 20, 2027 and (ii) the date that is ninety (90) days prior to the final maturity of any tranche of the Term Loan B, any incremental term loan or any refinancing term loan (or any refinancing or replacement thereof), as applicable, and (b) if no obligations are outstanding with respect to any tranche of the Term Loan B, any incremental term loan or any refinancing term loan, August 18, 2027 and (2) permanently reduces the aggregate commitments in respect of the Revolver by 5.0 million from 175.0 million to 170.0 million. The 2024 Amendment became effective on May 2, 2024 upon the completion of the 2017 Senior Notes Redemption. 
 Subject to certain exceptions, at any time prior to maturity, the 2020 Credit Agreement provides the Company with the right to increase the commitments under the Revolver and/or to establish one or more term loan facilities in an aggregate amount up to (i) the greater of 173.5 million and 50 LTM EBITDA (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement) plus (ii) additional amounts if (A) in the case of pari passu first lien secured indebtedness, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement) does not exceed 1.35:1.00, (B) in the case of junior lien secured indebtedness, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement, does not exceed 3.50:1.00, and (C) in the case of unsecured indebtedness, (x) the Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 3.50:1.00 or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement) is no less than 2.00:1.00. The balances of indebtedness used in the calculations of the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio and the Total Net Leverage Ratio include offsets for cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Revolver had unused available borrowing capacity of 170.0 million, and the outstanding balance of the Term Loan B and the 2024 Senior Notes wer e 272.9 million and 400.0 million, respectively. 
 The 2020 Credit Agreement requires the Company to make prepayments on the Term Loan B in connection with certain asset sales, receipts of insurance proceeds, incurrences of certain indebtedness and annual excess cash flow (in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions). At December 31, 2023, current maturities of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included 91.0 million of principal on the Term Loan B, relating to the mandatory prepayment provision of the 2020 Credit Agreement in respect of annual excess cash flow. The 91.0 million principal prepayment, which was due by the first week of April 2024, was paid in February 2024. 
 Borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates, which have increased since the latter part of 2022 due to changes in market conditions that resulted in increases in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (and the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR prior to the transition to SOFR), in the case of the Term Loan B, and the administrative agent s prime lending rate, in the case of the Revolver. Effective May 2, 2023, the 2020 Credit Agreement was amended to transition the Company s original LIBOR option in respect of the Term Loan B to Adjusted Term SOFR . The average borrowing rates on the Term Loan B and the Revolver for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 10.2 and 12.0 , respectively. At September 30, 2024, the borrowing rates on the Term Loan B and the Revolver were 9.7 and 11.5 , respectively. For more information regarding the terms of our 2020 Credit Agreement, refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The table below presents our actual and required First Lien Net Leverage ratio under the 2020 Credit Agreement for the period, which is calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis: 
 Trailing Four Fiscal Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 Actual Required First lien net leverage ratio 0.77 to 1.00 2.25 : 1.00 
 The 2020 Credit Agreement requires, solely with respect to the Revolver, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a maximum First Lien Net Leverage Ratio of 3.50:1.00, effective the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 and increasing to 3.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 and subsequently stepping down to 3.00:1.00 for the fiscal

 quarter ending June 30, 2023, 2.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023 and 2.25:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023 and each fiscal quarter thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance and expect to continue to be in compliance with the covenants under the 2020 Credit Agreement.
