capital through the future issuances of common stock and/or debt financing is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful
development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations
are necessary for the Company to continue operations. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors over the
next twelve months raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.

Overview 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on
June 6, 2007. On August 2, 2010, we changed our name from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings Corp. Effective January 1, 2015,
we completed an exchange agreement to purchase 100 of the outstanding interests of REMSleep LLC in exchange for 50,000,000 common shares
of REMSleep Holdings, Inc. s stock, at which time REMSleep LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary and adopted their business of
developing and distributing our sleep apnea products. On January 5, 2015, we changed our name to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. to reflect our
new business model. 

2 

Our officers have 35 years of sleep-industry
experience, including having been employed at sleep industry companies. Our officers invented our DeltaWave CPAP interface (the DeltaWave as an innovative new device to treat patients with sleep apnea. The patent-pending DeltaWave product is a nasal-pillows type interface
that will result in better comfort and, therefore, better compliance since it was specifically designed with unique airflow characteristics
to enable patients with sleep apnea to breathe normally. A survey that appeared in DME Business found that 89 of patients stated that
mask-interface comfort was their primary concern. The primary issue that we have addressed with the DeltaWave is the work of breathing 
component. We believe that our DeltaWave is designed to effectively address the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patient s
ability to comply with treatment, as follows: 

Does not disrupt normal
 breathing mechanics; 

Is not claustrophobic; 

Causes zero work of breathing
 (WOB); 

Minimizes or eliminates
 drying of the sinuses; 

Uses less driving pressure;
 and 

Allows users to feel safe
 and secure while sleeping. 

Pending adequate financing, we plan to conduct
clinical trials to test product effectiveness. 

On June 28, 2016, we applied for a patent for
a new, innovative sleep apnea product that serves as an interface for the delivery of CPAP therapy and other respiratory needs. Our goal
is to develop sleep products that achieve optimum compliance and comfort for CPAP patients. 

On April 27, 2021, Remsleep was awarded utility
patent 10987481 for its new Deltawave CPAP Pillows Mask for delivery of CPAP therapy and other respiratory needs. On March 5, 2024,
Remsleep was awarded design patent D1,017,025 S. Our goal is to continue to develop sleep products for the treatment of OSA and
capture 10 of the market in the next 24 months.

the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 8,010 or 26.1 . Professional fees consist mostly of

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash flow from operations 

Cash used in operating activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, was 537,686 compared to 617,739 of cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Cash Flows from Investing 

We used 73,700 and 135,955 of cash for investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash was used in investing activities for the purchase
of equipment and tooling. 

Cash Flows from Financing 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we received 125,000 for the issuance of a convertible note payable, 93,000 of which was paid back with cash, and 395,000 from the
sale of common stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repaid 183,931 of the loan payable due to our chairman. 

As of September 30, 2024, we have current assets
of 597,615 which includes 534,714 of cash and 30,107 of inventory. 

Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, there is substantial
doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow from revenue to fund our proposed
business. 

We have suffered recurring losses from operations
since our inception. In addition, we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the
financing required to develop our proposed business. As a result of these and other factors, our independent auditor has expressed substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future success and viability, therefore, are dependent upon our ability to
generate capital financing. The failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect
upon us and our shareholders. 

Management s plans with regard to these
matters encompass the following actions: (i) obtaining funding from new investors to alleviate our working capital deficiency, and (ii)
implementing a plan to generate sales. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to resolve our liquidity problems and increase
profitability in our current business operations. However, the outcome of management s plans cannot be ascertained with any degree
of certainty. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these risks and uncertainties.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, for a condensed discussion of our critical accounting policies and our Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023, for a full discussion of our critical accounting policies and procedures. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Each of our principal executive and principal
financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d
- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by
this quarterly report. Based on their evaluation, each such person concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of September 30, 2024 due to a lack of segregation of duties. 

In designing and evaluating disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. 

Our management has evaluated whether any change
in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, management concluded
that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the relevant period that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
