 Debt Securities The Company s investments in debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, consist of U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit and corporate bonds. These securities are held in escrow by the Company s wholly-owned captive insurance company and were purchased with restricted cash. As such, these securities are not available to fund the Company s operations. 
 Debt securities are recorded at fair value. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the available-for-sale debt securities was million and was classified based on the instruments maturity dates, with million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the available-for-sale debt securities was million, with million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 Debt securities classified as Level 1 had a fair value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Debt securities classified as Level 2 had a fair value of million as of September 30, 2024 and, as of December 31, 2023, Level 2 debt securities were immaterial. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost was million and million, respectively. The debt securities held at September 30, 2024 had remaining contractual maturities ranging from less than to approximately . Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.

 Liabilities for Contingent Consideration The Company is subject to contingent consideration arrangements in connection with certain business combinations. Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured at fair value each reporting period, with the acquisition-date fair value included as part of the consideration payable for the related business combination and subsequent changes in fair value recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company s consolidated statement of income. The fair value of contingent consideration was generally calculated using customary valuation models based on probability-weighted outcomes of meeting certain future performance targets and forecasted results. The key inputs to the valuations are the projections of future financial results in relation to the businesses and the company-specific discount rates. The Company classified the contingent consideration liabilities as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the lack of observable inputs used in the model.

 We are a leading provider of high-quality education and care, including early education and child care, back-up and family care solutions, and workforce education services that are designed to help families, employers and their employees solve the challenges of the modern workforce and thrive personally and professionally. We provide services primarily under multi-year contracts with employers who offer early education and child care, back-up care, and educational advisory services as part of their employee benefits packages in an effort to support employees across life and career stages and to improve recruitment, employee engagement, productivity, retention and career advancement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we operated 1,028 early education and child care centers with the capacity to serve approximately 115,000 children in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia and India. 
 Our reportable segments are comprised of (1) full service center-based child care, (2) back-up care, and (3) educational advisory services. Full service center-based child care includes traditional center-based early education and child care, preschool, and elementary education. Back-up care consists of center-based back-up child care, in-home care for children and adult/elder dependents, school-age camps, tutoring, pet care, self-sourced reimbursed care, and Sittercity, an online marketplace for families and caregivers. Educational advisory services include tuition assistance and student loan repayment program management, workforce education and related educational advising, and college admissions counseling services. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company realigned its organizational structure to better reflect synergies across certain business lines resulting in a change in reportable segments. As a result, the back-up care reportable segment now includes the Sittercity operations, which were previously reported in the educational advisory and other services segment. Segment information for 2023 has been recast to conform to the current year presentation. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we saw solid year-over-year revenue growth, with a 9 increase in revenue for our full service center-based child care segment and net enrollment growth of 3 as centers continue to re-ramp post-pandemic. To track our continued progress on the recovery from the pandemic, we monitor occupancy for a cohort of centers that has been operating since the 2021 fall enrollment cycle. Occupancy represents utilization for each respective center and is calculated as the average full-time enrollment divided by the total operating capacity during the period. This cohort of centers totaled 778 centers as of September 30, 2024. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 42 of these centers were more than 70 enrolled, 45 were between 40-70 enrolled and 13 were less than 40 enrolled, which reflects improved occupancy when compared to the same period in the prior year and reflects a decrease when compared to the second quarter of 2024 due to typical seasonal fluctuations. We also saw strong growth in back-up care with an 18 year-over-year increase in revenue as a result of increased utilization. 
 While we continue to see year-over-year growth and progress, we are still navigating through a dynamic operating environment that is impacted by increased costs, a tight labor market, varying enrollment demands, and shifting work demographics. We continue to monitor and respond to the changing conditions, and the evolving needs of clients, families and children, including through the closure of underperforming centers in order to optimize our portfolio of centers to accommodate such changes in demand and demographic workforce shifts in the markets we serve. As a result of the impact of the pandemic, there has been an elevated number of center closures in recent years in addition to the impairment of certain assets. We expect this trend to continue in 2024 as we execute on the closure of certain underperforming centers identified during our portfolio review process. Where possible, we shift enrollment and teachers to other centers at nearby locations. 
 We remain focused on our strategic priorities to deliver high quality education and care services, connect across our service lines, extend our impact on new customers and clients, and preserve our strong culture. As we continue to navigate this post-pandemic recovery period, we remain committed to serving the needs of families, clients and our employees. We are confident in our value proposition, business model, the strength of our client partnerships, the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position, and our ability to continue to respond to changing market conditions.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 73.3 million, or 11 , to 719.1 million from 645.8 million for the same period in 2023. The following table summarizes the revenue and percentage of total revenue for each of our segments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 vs 2023 (In thousands, except percentages) Full service center-based child care 486,567 67.7 444,747 68.9 41,820 9.4 Tuition 440,663 90.6 401,595 90.3 39,068 9.7 Management fees and operating subsidies 45,904 9.4 43,152 9.7 2,752 6.4 Back-up care 201,783 28.0 171,423 26.5 30,360 17.7 Educational advisory services 30,749 4.3 29,617 4.6 1,132 3.8 Total revenue 719,099 100.0 645,787 100.0 73,312 11.4 
 Revenue generated by the full service center-based child care segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 41.8 million, or 9 , when compared to the same period in 2023. Tuition revenue increased by 39.1 million, or 10 , when compared to the prior year, due to a 3 net increase in enrollment and average tuition rate increases at our child care centers of approximately 5 . While we continue to see enrollment growth at our centers, the ongoing labor market challenges and current economic conditions have impacted the recovery in both the United States and international markets, and we continue to operate below pre-pandemic enrollment levels at certain locations. We expect occupancy improvement to continue in relation to the same prior year periods through the remainder of 2024. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for our United Kingdom, Netherlands and Australia operations also contributed to our revenue growth, increasing 2024 tuition revenue by approximately 1 , or 3.8 million. While we expect to be impacted by fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates throughout the year, we do not expect such fluctuations to have a significant impact to the full year results for 2024. 
 Management fees and operating subsidies from employer sponsors increased by 2.8 million, or 6 , primarily due to higher operating subsidies required to support center operations as enrollment continues to increase, and due to a decrease in funding received from pandemic-related government support programs as most of the programs for which we were eligible for expired in September 2023. Funding received from pandemic-related government support programs reduce certain center operating costs, which impacts the related operating subsidies. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, such funding reduced the operating subsidy revenue due from employers by 5.0 million. 
 Revenue generated by back-up care services in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 30.4 million, or 18 , when compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue growth in the back-up care segment was primarily attributable to increased utilization of center-based, in-home and school age camp back-up care by new and existing clients. 
 Revenue generated by educational advisory services in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.1 million, or 4 , when compared to the same period in 2023 on increased utilization. 
 Cost of Services. Cost of services increased by 49.5 million, or 10 , to 537.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 488.1 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Cost of services in the full service center-based child care segment increased by 36.3 million, or 9 , to 421.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cost of services was primarily associated with increased personnel costs related to expanded enrollment and wage rate increases. Personnel costs, which generally represent 70 of the costs for this segment, increased 6 during the quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition to the personnel costs for the incremental 3 net enrollment noted above and premiums associated with the deployment of temporary staff to meet enrollment demand, we continue to invest in higher wages for our center staff, resulting in an increase of approximately 4 to the average hourly wage in 2024 compared to 2023. Additionally, most of the pandemic-related government support programs for which we were eligible ended September 2023. Funding received from pandemic-related government support programs reduced center operating expenses by a total of 13.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. As noted above, a portion of the funding received from pandemic-related government support programs reduced the operating costs in certain employer-sponsored centers, which in turn reduced the operating subsidy revenue due from employers for the related child care centers by 5.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Cost of services in the back-up care segment increased by 12.4 million, or 14 , to 101.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the prior year. The increase in cost of services correlates to the increase in revenue and is primarily associated with higher care provider fees generated by the increase in utilization levels of center-based and in-home back-up care over the prior year, and continued investment in personnel, marketing and technology to support our customer user experience and service offerings. 
 Cost of services in the educational advisory services segment increased by 0.8 million, or 5 , to 14.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year, due to investments in personnel, product suite and technology to support customer access and user experience. 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by 23.9 million, or 15 , to 181.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 157.6 million for the same period in 2023. Incremental gross profit contributions from the full service center-based child care segment, resulting from enrollment growth and the associated operating leverage, and from the back-up care segment, resulting from higher utilization of back-up care services, were partially offset by reduced funding from pandemic-related government support programs. Gross profit margin was 25 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 1 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SGA ). SGA increased by 6.2 million, or 7 , to 89.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 83.3 million for the same period in 2023, due to incremental spending to support the business as it continues to re-ramp post-pandemic, and higher personnel costs. SGA was 12 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, generally consistent with the same period in 2023. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization expense on intangible assets was 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases from intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the period, partially offset by increases from intangible assets acquired in relation to the acquisitions completed in 2023 and 2024. 
 Income from Operations. Income from operations increased by 22.6 million, or 34 , to 89.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year. The following table summarizes income from operations and percentage of revenue for each of our segments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 2023 
 Change 2024 vs 2023 (In thousands, except percentages) Full service center-based child care 12,465 2.6 6,990 1.6 5,475 78.3 Back-up care 70,487 34.9 52,257 30.5 18,230 34.9 Educational advisory services 6,444 21.0 7,577 25.6 (1,133) (15.0) Income from operations 89,396 12.4 66,824 10.3 22,572 33.8 
 The change in income from operations was primarily due to the following: 
 Income from operations for the full service center-based child care segment increased 5.5 million, or 78 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in tuition revenue from enrollment growth and annual tuition rate increases, partially offset by increased personnel costs and a decrease of approximately 9 million in net contributions from pandemic-related government support programs as most of the programs for which we were eligible ended by September 30, 2023. 
 Income from operations for the back-up care segment increased 18.2 million, or 35 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 due in part to incremental contributions from expanded utilization of back-up care services and lower overhead costs, including an allocation of shared services costs which have historically remained relatively stable throughout the year. 
 Income from operations for the educational advisory services segment decreased 1.1 million, or 15 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 due to personnel, technology platform and product design investments to support revenue growth and business transformation.

 Net Interest Expense. Net interest expense was 11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a lack of interest expense in 2024 associated with the deferred payment for the Only About Children acquisition and contingent consideration for a 2021 acquisition, in addition to higher interest income and lower average borrowings, partially offset by higher interest rates applicable to our debt inclusive of the interest rate caps. The weighted average interest rate for the term loans and revolving credit facility was 4.84 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.90 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, inclusive of the effects of the cash flow hedges. Based on our current interest rate projections, we estimate that our overall weighted average interest rate will approximate 5.00 for the remainder of 2024 inclusive of the effects of the cash flow hedges. 
 Income Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expense of 22.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, at an effective income tax rate of 29 , compared to an income tax expense of 14.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, at an effective income tax rate of 27 . The difference between the effective income tax rates as compared to the statutory income tax rates was primarily due to the impact of unbenefited losses in certain foreign subsidiaries and the effects of net shortfall tax expense associated with the exercise or expiration of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. The effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter for various reasons, including changes to income before income tax, jurisdictional mix of income before income tax, unbenefited losses, valuation allowances, jurisdictional income tax rate changes, as well as discrete items such as non-deductible transaction costs, the settlement of foreign, federal and state tax matters and the effects of excess (shortfall) tax benefit (expense) associated with the exercise or expiration of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net shortfall tax expense from stock-based compensation increased tax expense by 0.2 million and 0.1 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, prior to the inclusion of the shortfall tax expense, other discrete items and unbenefited losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, the effective tax rate approximated 27 and 28 , respectively. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Income from Operations. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19.8 million, or 20 , and adjusted income from operations increased 22.6 million, or 34 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to increased contributions from both the back-up care segment and the full service center-based child care segment. 
 Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted net income increased 13.8 million, or 27 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in adjusted income from operations and a lower tax rate. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue. Revenue increased by 209.3 million, or 12 , to 2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.8 billion for the same period in 2023. The following table summarizes the revenue and percentage of total revenue for each of our segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 vs 2023 (In thousands, except percentages) Full service center-based child care 1,477,284 73.4 1,333,469 74.0 143,815 10.8 Tuition 1,344,622 91.0 1,212,760 90.9 131,862 10.9 Management fees and operating subsidies 132,662 9.0 120,709 9.1 11,953 9.9 Back-up care 452,945 22.5 389,391 21.6 63,554 16.3 Educational advisory services 81,638 4.1 79,749 4.4 1,889 2.4 Total revenue 2,011,867 100.0 1,802,609 100.0 209,258 11.6 
 Revenue generated by the full service center-based child care segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 143.8 million, or 11 , when compared to the same period in 2023. Tuition revenue increased by 131.9 million, or 11 , when compared to the prior year, due to a 5 net increase in enrollment and average tuition rate increases at our child care centers of approximately 5 . As noted above, while we continue to see enrollment growth at our centers, the ongoing labor market challenges and current economic conditions have impacted the recovery in both the United States and international markets, and we continue to operate below pre-pandemic enrollment levels at certain locations. We expect occupancy improvement to continue in relation to the same prior year periods through the remainder of 2024. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for our United Kingdom, Netherlands and Australia operations also contributed to our revenue growth, increasing 2024 tuition revenue by approximately 6.4 million.

 Management fees and operating subsidies from employer sponsors increased by 12.0 million, or 10 , primarily due to higher operating subsidies required to support center operations as enrollment continues to increase, and due to a decrease in funding received from pandemic-related government support programs as most of the programs for which we were eligible for expired in September 2023. Funding received from pandemic-related government support programs reduced certain center operating costs, which impacts the related operating subsidies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, such funding reduced the operating subsidy revenue due from employers by 17.2 million. 
 Revenue generated by back-up care services in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 63.6 million, or 16 , when compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue growth in the back-up care segment was primarily attributable to increased utilization of center-based, in-home and school-age camp back-up care by new and existing clients. 
 Revenue generated by educational advisory services in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.9 million, or 2 , when compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenue growth in this segment was primarily attributable to increased utilization. 
 Cost of Services. Cost of services increased 146.0 million, or 11 , to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 Cost of services in the full service center-based child care segment increased by 113.1 million, or 10 , to 1.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cost of services was primarily associated with increased personnel costs related to expanded enrollment and wage rate increases. Personnel costs increased 7 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition to the personnel costs for the incremental 5 net enrollment noted above and premiums associated with the deployment of temporary staff to meet enrollment demand, we continue to invest in higher wages for our center staff, resulting in an increase of approximately 4 to the average hourly wage in 2024 compared to 2023. Additionally, most of the pandemic-related government support programs for which we were eligible ended September 2023. Funding received from pandemic-related government support programs reduced center operating expenses by a total of 48.3 million in 2023. As noted above, a portion of the funding received from pandemic-related government support programs reduced the operating costs in certain employer-sponsored centers, which in turn reduced the operating subsidy revenue due from employers for the related child care centers by 17.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of services in the back-up care segment increased 30.6 million, or 14 , to 247.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year. The increase in cost of services correlates to the increase in revenue and is primarily associated with higher care provider fees generated by the increase in utilization levels of center-based and in-home back-up care over the prior year, and continued investment in personnel, marketing and technology to support our customer user experience and service offerings. Cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 4.3 million in value-added tax related to prior periods. 
 Cost of services in the educational advisory services segment increased by 2.3 million, or 6 , to 44.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year, due to investments in personnel, product suite and technology to support customer access and user experience. 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 63.3 million, or 15 , to 479.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 415.8 million for the same period in 2023. Incremental gross profit contributions from the full service center-based child care segment, resulting from enrollment growth and the associated operating leverage, and from the back-up care segment, resulting from higher utilization of back-up care services, were partially offset by reduced funding from pandemic-related government support programs. Gross profit margin was 24 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 1 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA increased 16.6 million, or 7 , to 264.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 247.9 million for the same period in 2023, due to incremental spending to support the business as it continues to re-ramp post-pandemic, higher personnel costs and a 2.3 million charge within the back-up care segment resulting from the early settlement of contingent consideration for a 2021 acquisition. SGA for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included value-added tax expense of 1.7 million related to prior periods. SGA was 13 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 1 from the same period in 2023. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization expense on intangible assets of 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased from 24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the period, partially offset by increases from intangible assets acquired in relation to the acquisitions completed in 2023 and 2024.

 Income from Operations. Income from operations increased by 55.4 million, or 39 , to 198.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The following table summarizes income from operations and percentage of revenue for each of our segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 vs 2023 (In thousands, except percentages) Full service center-based child care 66,553 4.5 28,493 2.1 38,060 133.6 Back-up care 118,063 26.1 97,500 25.0 20,563 21.1 Educational advisory services 13,776 16.9 17,008 21.3 (3,232) (19.0) Income from operations 198,392 9.9 143,001 7.9 55,391 38.7 
 The change in income from operations was due to the following: 
 Income from operations for the full service center-based child care segment increased 38.1 million, or 134 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in tuition revenue from enrollment growth and annual tuition rate increases, partially offset by increased personnel costs, and a decrease of approximately 33 million in net contributions from government support programs as most of the programs for which we were eligible ended by September 30, 2023. Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 1.7 million in value-added tax expense related to prior periods. 
 Income from operations for the back-up care segment increased 20.6 million, or 21 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Incremental contributions from expanded utilization of back-up care services were partially offset by higher overhead costs, including an allocation of shared services costs which have historically remained relatively stable throughout the year. Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 2.3 million charge related to the early settlement of contingent consideration for a 2021 acquisition and income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 4.3 million in value-added tax expense related to prior periods. 
 Income from operations for the educational advisory services segment decreased 3.2 million, or 19 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 due to personnel, product design, and technology platform investments to support revenue growth and business transformation. 
 Net Interest Expense. Net interest expense of 37.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained fairly consistent with net interest expense of 37.4 million for the same period in 2023, due to higher interest rates applicable to our debt, offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with the deferred payment for the Only About Children acquisition (which was paid in January 2024) and contingent consideration for a 2021 acquisition (which was paid in April 2024), lower average borrowings and higher interest income. The weighted average interest rate for the term loans and revolving credit facility was 4.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.92 for the same period in 2023, inclusive of the effects of the cash flow hedges. 
 Income Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expense of 50.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective income tax rate of 31 , compared to an income tax expense of 36.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, at an effective income tax rate of 35 . The difference between the effective income tax rates as compared to the statutory income tax rates was primarily due to the impact of unbenefited losses in certain foreign subsidiaries and the effects of net shortfall tax expense associated with the exercise or expiration of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. The effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter for various reasons, including changes to income before income tax, jurisdictional mix of income before income tax, unbenefited losses, valuation allowances, jurisdictional income tax rate changes, as well as discrete items such as non-deductible transaction costs, the settlement of foreign, federal and state tax matters and the effects of excess (shortfall) tax benefit (expense) associated with the exercise or expiration of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net shortfall tax expense from stock-based compensation increased tax expense by 0.9 million and 3.0 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, prior to the inclusion of the shortfall tax expense, other discrete items and unbenefited losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, the effective tax rate approximated 27 and 28 , respectively. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Income from Operations. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income from operations increased 45.7 million, or 18 , and 49.4 million, or 33 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to the incremental gross profit contributions from the full service center-based child care segment resulting from enrollment growth and tuition price increases and from the back-up care segment resulting from increased utilization.

 Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted net income increased 29.6 million, or 25 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in adjusted income from operations. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation 
 In our quarterly and annual reports, earnings press releases and conference calls, we discuss key financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are reconciled from their respective measures determined under GAAP as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands, except share data) Net income 54,905 39,979 111,068 68,699 Interest expense net 11,613 12,222 37,307 37,357 Income tax expense 22,878 14,623 50,017 36,945 Depreciation 19,862 18,935 59,462 57,834 Amortization of intangible assets (a)

 (a) Amortization of intangible assets represents amortization expense, including amortization expense of 0.1 million and 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and of 8.4 million and 15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, associated with intangible assets recorded in connection with our going private transaction in May 2008. 
 (b) Stock-based compensation expense represents non-cash stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. 
 (c) Other costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consist of value-added tax expense of 6.0 million related to prior periods, of which 4.3 million was associated with the back-up care segment and 1.7 million was associated with the full service center-based child care segment.

 (d) Interest on deferred consideration represents the imputed interest on the deferred consideration issued in connection with the July 1, 2022 acquisition of Only About Children, a child care operator in Australia. The deferred consideration was paid in January 2024. 
 (e) Adjusted income tax expense represents income tax expense calculated on adjusted income before income tax at an effective tax rate of approximately 28 and 29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and at an effective tax rate of approximately 28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The jurisdictional mix of the expected adjusted income before income tax for the full year will affect the estimated effective tax rate for the year. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP (collectively referred to as non-GAAP financial measures ), and the use of the terms adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations. We present the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental performance measures because we believe they facilitate a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under GAAP, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA allows for an assessment of our operating performance and of our ability to service or incur indebtedness without the effect of non-cash charges, such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense, and non-recurring costs, such as value-added-tax expense related to prior periods and at times, other non-recurring costs, such as impairment costs and transaction costs. In addition, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share allow us to assess our performance without the impact of the specifically identified items that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures also function as key performance indicators used to evaluate our operating performance internally, and they are used in connection with the determination of incentive compensation for management, including executive officers. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in connection with the determination of certain ratio requirements under our credit agreement. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to income before taxes, net income, diluted earnings per common share, net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing or financing activities or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with GAAP. Consequently, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We understand that although adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income do not fully reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt; and 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
 Because of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary cash requirements are for the ongoing operations of our existing early education and child care centers, back-up care, educational advisory services, the addition of new centers through development or acquisitions, and debt financing obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash flows from operations, and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. We had 109.9 million in cash 119.1 million including restricted cash) at September 30, 2024, of which 47.4 million was held in foreign jurisdictions, compared to 71.6 million in cash 89.5 million including restricted cash) at December 31, 2023, of which 32.1 million was held in foreign jurisdictions. Operations outside of North America accounted for 28 and 27 of our consolidated revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net impact on our liquidity from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. While we expect to be impacted by fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates throughout the year, we do not currently expect that the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have a material net impact on our liquidity, capital resources or results from operations for the remainder of 2024. 
 Our 400 million revolving credit facility is part of our senior secured credit facilities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 389.8 million and 380.7 million of the revolving credit facility, respectively, was available for borrowing. 
 We had a working capital deficit of 262.9 million and 352.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our working capital deficit has primarily arisen from using cash to make long-term investments in fixed assets and acquisitions, deferred consideration issued in relation to an acquisition and from share repurchases. We anticipate that our cash flows from operating activities will continue to expand as our center enrollment re-ramps and performance continues to recover. As we continue to progress on the enrollment and ramping of centers, we expect to allocate capital to investments that support current operations and strategic opportunities, as well as principal and interest payments on our debt and revolver, and share repurchases from time to time. 
 In January 2024, the Company paid deferred consideration of 106.5 million related to the 2022 acquisition of Only About Children, a child care operator in Australia. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we participated in certain government support programs that were enacted in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the expiration of the child care stabilization grants on September 30, 2023, most of the pandemic-related government support programs for which we were eligible ended in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 48.3 million was recorded as a reduction to cost of services in relation to these benefits, of which 17.2 million reduced the operating subsidies paid by employers for the related child care centers. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 1.7 million was recorded to revenue related to amounts received for tuition support. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 891.8 million in lease liabilities, 104.7 million of which is short term in nature. Refer to Note 3, Leases , to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on leases, including the maturity of the contractual obligations related to our lease liabilities. 
 The board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 400 million of our outstanding common stock, effective December 16, 2021. The share repurchase program has no expiration date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not make any share repurchases under the Board-approved repurchase program, and at September 30, 2024, 198.3 million remained available for future repurchases. All repurchased shares have been retired. 
 We believe that funds provided by operations, our existing cash balances, and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund all obligations and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if we were to experience renewed disruption from the pandemic or other similar global health crisis or if we were to undertake any significant acquisitions or make investments in the purchase of facilities for new or existing centers, we could require financing beyond our existing cash and borrowing capacity, and it could be necessary for us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms, if at all.

 Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 216.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 161.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by operations primarily relates to an increase in net income of 42.4 million, as well as higher cash provided by working capital arising from the timing of billings and payments when compared to the prior year. 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 92.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 92.0 million for the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 8.3 million in acquisitions, compared to an investment of 37.8 million during the same period in the prior year, a decrease in cash used of 29.5 million. This decrease in cash used was partially offset by an increase in net purchases of debt securities and other investments. Net purchases of debt securities by our captive insurance entity, using restricted cash, and other investments were 19.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net proceeds of 6.0 million during the same period in the prior year, a net increase of cash used of 25.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net investments of 65.3 million in fixed asset purchases for maintenance and refurbishments in our existing centers, technology across all segments, and new child care centers, compared to net investments of 60.2 million during the same period in the prior year. 
 Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 95.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 60.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to payments for deferred and contingent consideration of 103.9 million, of which 97.7 million related to the deferred consideration for the 2022 acquisition of Only About Children and 6.2 million related to the contingent consideration for a 2021 acquisition. This increase in cash used was partially offset by a decrease in net payments related to our revolving credit facility, which were 54.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in the current year wherein the net activity under our revolving credit facility amounted to zero. Additionally, proceeds received from the exercise of employee equity awards in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 16.0 million compared to the prior year due to a higher volume of transactions and higher exercise prices. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options were 24.8 million and 8.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding under the revolver were 10.2 million, with 389.8 million available for borrowing. At December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were 19.3 million, with 380.7 million available for borrowing. 
 Borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to variable interest. We mitigate our interest rate exposure with interest rate cap agreements. In June 2020, we entered into interest rate cap agreements with a total notional value of 800 million. These interest rate cap agreements, designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges, provided us with interest rate protection in the event the one-month term SOFR rate increased above 0.9 . Interest rate cap agreements for 300 million notional value had an effective date of June 30, 2020 and expired on October 31, 2023, while interest rate cap agreements for another 500 million notional amount had an effective date of October 29, 2021 and expired on October 31, 2023. In December 2021, we entered into interest rate cap agreements with a total notional value of 900 million designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. Interest rate cap agreements for 600 million, which had a forward starting effective date of October 31, 2023 and expire on October 31, 2025, provide the Company with interest rate protection in the event the one-month term SOFR rate increases above 2.4 . Interest rate cap agreements for 300 million, which had a forward starting effective date of October 31, 2023 and expire on October 31, 2026, provide the Company with interest rate protection in the event the one-month term SOFR rate increases above 2.9 . 
 The blended weighted average interest rate for the term loans and revolving credit facility was 4.93 and 3.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, including the impact of the cash flow hedges. Based on our current interest rate projections, we estimate that our overall weighted average interest rate will approximate 5.00 for the remainder of 2024 inclusive of the effects of the cash flow hedges. 
 The term loan A and the revolving credit facility require Bright Horizons Family Solutions LLC, the borrower, and its restricted subsidiaries, to comply with a maximum first lien net leverage ratio. A breach of this covenant is subject to certain equity cure rights. The credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. We were in compliance with our financial covenant at September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 6, Credit Arrangements and Debt Obligations , to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt and credit arrangements, future principal payments of long-term debt, and covenant requirements.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods and that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are, from time to time, subject to claims, suits, and matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Such claims have in the past generally been covered by insurance, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover all liabilities that may arise out of claims or matters brought against us. We believe the resolution of such legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We believe that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
