As of June 30, 2024, of securities had been sold with the remaining sold during early July 2024. It was management s intent that these securities be sold as of June 30, 2024; therefore, the securities amortized cost basis was reduced to fair value through income as of June 30, 2024. Approximately of the proceeds of the securities sold were reinvested as of June 30, 2024 with the remainder reinvested during the third quarter of 2024.

 Available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is reduced to fair value through income. For available-for sale debt securities that do not meet the criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security and the issuer, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its

 allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 Although management has the ability to sell these securities if the need arises, their designation as available-for-sale should not necessarily be interpreted as an indication that management anticipates such sales. 
 
 Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaled at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 
 
 The Company s equity securities are listed as Other Investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist of non-controlling investment in a single banking organization at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The original investment totaled and other-than-temporary impairment was previously recorded totaling . The Company s equity securities are considered not to have readily determinable fair value and are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment. At September 30, 2024, there was additional impairment recognized through earnings. 

NOTE 6 - 
 
 at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. These interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. The agreements are considered stand-alone derivatives and changes in the fair value of derivatives are reported in earnings as non-interest income. While the derivatives represent economic hedges, they do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. 
 
 Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company s exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts. There are provisions in the agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold. Exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized. In addition, the Company minimizes credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures.

 Loan Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 Effective January 1, 2023, the Company prospectively adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting for troubled debt restructurings while establishing a new standard for the treatment of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. As such, effective with the adoption of the new standard, the Company will not include, prospectively, financial difficulty modifications in its presentation of nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets or classified assets. Prior period data, which included troubled debt restructurings, has not been adjusted. 
 
 The Company s loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties will typically include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. modifications during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted in a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had modified loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. There were modified loans that had a payment default during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and were modified in the twelve months prior to that default to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company considers a loan to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators: 
 
 . This analysis is typically performed on at least an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 
 Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

 primary segments: core banking, wealth management services, and insurance operations. On June 1, 2024, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its insurance operations to Hilb Group, and ceased insurance-related activities for the Company. As a result of the sale, insurance revenue and expenses reported within the accompanying financial statements reflect the first five months of 2024. See Note 3 for additional information on this sale. 
 
 The core banking segment involves attracting deposits from the general public and using such funds to originate consumer, commercial and agricultural, commercial and agricultural real estate, and residential mortgage loans, primarily in the Company s local markets by the Company s banking subsidiary, German American Bank. Net interest income from loans and investments funded by deposits and borrowings is the primary revenue for the core-banking segment. The core banking segment also involves the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The wealth management segment s revenues are comprised primarily of fees generated by the wealth advisory and trust operations of the Company s banking subsidiary and by German American Investment Services, Inc. These fees are derived by providing trust, investment advisory, brokerage and retirement planning services to its customers. The insurance segment offered a full range of personal and corporate property and casualty insurance products, primarily in the Company s banking subsidiary s local markets. Commissions derived from the sale of insurance products by GAI were the primary source of revenue for the insurance segment. 
 
 segments are the same as those of the Company. The evaluation process for segments does not include holding company income and expense. Holding company amounts are the primary differences between segment amounts and consolidated totals, and are reflected in the column labeled Other below, along with amounts to eliminate transactions between segments.

Absent the credit rating, significant assumptions must be made such that the credit risk input becomes an unobservable input and thus these investment securities are reported by the Company in a Level 3 classification. 
 
 Derivatives: The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). 
 
 Individually Analyzed Loans: Fair values for collateral dependent loans are generally based on appraisals obtained from licensed real estate appraisers and in certain circumstances includes consideration of offers obtained to purchase properties prior to foreclosure. Appraisals for commercial real estate generally use three methods to derive value: cost, sales or market comparison and income approach. The cost method bases value in the cost to replace the current property. Value of market comparison approach evaluates the sales price of similar properties in the same market area. The income approach considers net operating income generated by the property and an investor s required return. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Comparable sales adjustments are based on known sales prices of similar type and similar use properties and duration

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 GERMAN AMERICAN BANCORP, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 German American Bancorp, Inc. is a Nasdaq-listed (symbol: GABC) financial holding company based in Jasper, Indiana. German American, through its banking subsidiary German American Bank, operates 74 banking offices in 20 contiguous southern Indiana counties and 14 Kentucky counties. 
 
 Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis, as elsewhere in this Report, when we use the term Company, we will usually be referring to the business and affairs (financial and otherwise) of German American Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates as a whole. Occasionally, we will refer to the term parent company or holding company when we mean to refer to only German American Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 This section presents an analysis of the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere herein and with the financial statements and other financial data, as well as the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW 
 
 This updated discussion should be read in conjunction with the Management Overview that was included in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled 21,048,000, or 0.71 per share, a decrease of 3 on a per share basis compared with the third quarter 2023 net income of 21,451,000, or 0.73 per share. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 60,600,000, or 2.04 per share, a decrease of 6 on a per share basis compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 net income of 64,381,000, or 2.18 per share. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the Company s sale of substantially all of the assets of its wholly-owned subsidiary, German American Insurance, Inc. GAI ), to Hilb Group, an industry-leading insurance broker on June 1, 2024. The all-cash sale price totaled 40.0 million, and resulted in an after-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of approximately 27,476,000, or 0.93 per share. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by a securities portfolio restructuring transaction whereby available securities totaling approximately 375.3 million in book value were identified in late June 2024 to be sold. The approximate loss on these securities totaled 34,893,000, 27,189,000 after tax, or 0.92 per share, and was included in earnings for the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 For further information regarding the insurance asset sale and the securities portfolio restructuring, see Note 3 and Note 5, respectfully, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 On July 29, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Heartland BancCorp Heartland ), pursuant to which Heartland agreed to merge with and into the Company. The merger agreement also provides that Heartland s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Heartland Bank, will be merged with and into German American s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, German American Bank, immediately following the holding company merger. 
 
 Under the terms of the merger agreement, each record holder of Heartland common stock (other than dissenting shares and shares held in the Heartland 401(k) plan) will receive, for each share of Heartland common stock, 3.90 shares of the Company s common stock in a tax-free exchange. Heartland Bank, as the administrator and record holder of shares of Heartland common stock held in the Heartland 401(k) plan, will receive in exchange for each share of Heartland common stock held in such plan, on behalf of the beneficial owners of such shares, a cash payment based on the 3.90 exchange ratio. Any option to acquire a share of Heartland common stock outstanding at the closing of the merger will be cancelled in exchange for a cash cancellation payment based on the 3.90 exchange ratio, less the option exercise price per share and any applicable withholding taxes. 
 
 44 

Based on the number of shares of Heartland common stock currently outstanding, the Company expects to issue approximately 7.66 million shares of its common stock, and pay approximately 25 million in cash (based upon a 39.84 per share volume-weighted average price for the Company s common stock over the 10-day trading period ended July 26, 2024, the business day immediately preceding the date that the merger was announced), in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Heartland common stock (including the shares held in the Heartland 401(k) plan) and in cancellation of all outstanding options to acquire Heartland common stock.

As of June 30, 2024, Heartland Bank operated 20 full-service banking offices and had approximately 1.9 billion of total assets, 1.5 billion of total loans and 1.6 billion of total deposits. Giving effect to the merger today, the combined organization will have more than 8.1 billion in assets and a banking office network of almost 94 rural, suburban and urban locations across Southern Indiana, Central and Northern Kentucky and Central and Southwest Ohio. 
 
 Consummation of the merger is subject to approval by federal and state banking regulatory authorities, approval by the shareholders of both the Company and Heartland, and certain other closing conditions. Assuming such approvals are timely secured, the Company expects that the merger will be completed in the first quarter of 2025.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The financial condition and results of operations for the Company presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this Report, are, to a large degree, dependent upon the Company s accounting policies. The selection of and application of these policies involve estimates, judgments, and uncertainties that are subject to change. The critical accounting policies and estimates that the Company has determined to be the most susceptible to change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of securities available for sale, income tax expense, and the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to cover the estimated expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of the loan portfolio. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged-off. A provision for credit losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance. Evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary. The ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the Company s control. 
 
 The Company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on individually analyzed loans, estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans, and consideration of past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other factors, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance consists of two components of allocations, specific and general. These two components represent the total allowance for credit losses deemed adequate to cover expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan portfolio. 
 
 Commercial and agricultural loans are subject to a standardized grading process administered by an internal loan review function. The need for specific reserves is considered for credits when: (a) the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan; (b) the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination; (c) the loan is on non-accrual; or (d) other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question, or the loan characteristics require special monitoring. 
 
 Specific reserves on individually analyzed loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds. Allocations are also applied to categories of loans not individually analyzed but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than other similar type loans, including non-performing consumer or residential real estate loans. Such allocations are based on past loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values. 
 
 45 

General allocations are made for commercial and agricultural loans that are graded as substandard and special mention, but are not individually analyzed for specific reserves as well as other pools of loans, including non-classified loans, homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans, and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss. General allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on historical averages for loan losses for these portfolios along with reasonable and supportable forecasts, judgmentally adjusted for economic, external and internal quantitative and qualitative factors and portfolio trends. Economic factors include evaluating changes in international, national, regional and local economic and business conditions that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio. Internal factors include evaluating changes in lending policies and procedures; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; and changes in experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses for loans represents management s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of the loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness and adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. 
 
 The Company uses a number of economic variables in its scenarios to estimate the allowance for credit losses, with the most significant drivers being unemployment rate forecast, gross domestic product and agricultural producer price index as well as qualitative adjustments. Historical loss rates from periods where the average unemployment rate, gross domestic product and agricultural producer pricing index matches the forecast range are considered when calculating the forecast period loss rate. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses remained stable as compared to December 31, 2023. 
 
 Based on sensitivity analysis of all portfolios, a 0.050 change (slight improvement or decline on the Company s scale) in all ten qualitative risk factors would have a 1,900,000 impact on the reserve allocation. The sensitivity and related range of impact is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent management s judgements or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at September 30, 2024 in estimation of the allowance for credit losses on loans recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Securities Valuation 
 
 Available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available-for sale debt securities that do not meet the criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security and the issuer, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. No allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities was needed at September 30, 2024. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. As of September 30, 2024, gross unrealized gains on the securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled approximately 6,633,000 and gross unrealized losses totaled approximately 227,813,000. The net amount of these two items, net of applicable taxes, is included in other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, less impairment with observable price changes being recognized in earnings. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations presumed to occur. 
 
 A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carry-back and carry-forward periods, including consideration of available tax planning strategies. Tax-related loss contingencies, including assessments arising from tax examinations and tax strategies, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. In 
 46 

considering the likelihood of loss, management considers the nature of the contingency, the progress of any examination or related protest or appeal, the views of legal counsel and other advisors, experience of the Company or other enterprises in similar matters, if any, and management s intended response to any assessment. 
 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 
 Goodwill resulting from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the Company s balance sheet. No impairment to Goodwill was indicated based on year-end testing. 
 
 Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit and acquired customer relationship intangible assets. They are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 6 to 10 years. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled 21,048,000, or 0.71 per share, a decrease of 3 on a per share basis compared with the third quarter 2023 net income of 21,451,000, or 0.73 per share. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 60,600,000, or 2.04 per share, a decrease of 6 on a per share basis compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 net income of 64,381,000, or 2.18 per share. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the previously discussed sale of substantially all of the assets of German American Insurance, Inc. to Hilb Group, an industry-leading insurance broker. The all-cash sale price totaled 40.0 million and resulted in an after-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of approximately 27,476,000, or 0.93 per share. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by the aforementioned securities portfolio restructuring transaction whereby available securities totaling approximately 375.3 million in book value were identified to be sold. The approximate loss on these securities totaled 34,893,000, 27,189,000 after tax, or 0.92 per share, and was included in earnings for the second quarter of 2024.

 During the third quarter of 2024, net interest income, on a non tax-equivalent basis, totaled 48,594,000, an increase of 1,035,000, or 2 , compared to the third quarter of 2023 net interest income of 47,559,000. The improvement in net interest income during the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to a higher level of earning assets, most notably an increased loan portfolio, partially offset by a lower net interest margin. During the first nine months of 2024, net interest income, on a non tax-equivalent basis, totaled 139,559,000, a decrease of 5,267,000, or 4 , compared to the first nine months of 2023 net interest income of 144,826,000. The decline in net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily attributable to a decline in the Company s net interest margin. 
 
 The tax equivalent net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 3.47 compared with 3.57 in the third quarter of 2023. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.39 compared with 3.63 for the same period of 2023. The cost of funds continued to accelerate higher in both periods due to highly competitive deposit pricing in the marketplace, customers actively looking for yield opportunities within and outside the banking industry and a continued shift in the Company s deposit composition to a higher level of time deposits. The decline in the net interest margin in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 was largely driven by the increased cost of funds and a lower level of accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans. 
 
 49 

The Company s net interest margin and net interest income have been impacted by accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans. Accretion of discounts on acquired loans totaled 237,000 during the third quarter of 2024 and 1,288,000 during the third quarter of 2023. Accretion of discounts on acquired loans totaled 889,000 and 2,533,000 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans contributed approximately 2 basis points to the net interest margin in the third quarter of 2024 and 9 basis points in the third quarter of 2023. Accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans contributed approximately 2 basis points to the net interest margin in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 6 basis points in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses: 
 
 The Company provides for credit losses through regular provisions to the allowance for credit losses. The provision is affected by net charge-offs on loans and changes in specific and general allocations of the allowance. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 625,000 compared with a provision for credit losses of 900,000 during the third quarter of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 2,150,000 compared with a provision for credit losses of 2,550,000 for the first half of 2023. 
 
 Net charge-offs totaled 447,000, or 4 basis points, on an annualized basis, of average loans outstanding during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 520,000, or 5 basis points, on an annualized basis, of average loans during the third quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs totaled 1,791,000, or 6 basis points, on an annualized basis, of average loans outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2,072,000, or 7 basis points, on an annualized basis, of average loans outstanding during the same period of 2023. 
 
 The provision for credit losses made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio. A detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is completed quarterly by management, the results of which are used to determine provision for credit losses. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts along with other qualitative and quantitative factors. 
 
 Non-interest Income: 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled 13,801,000, a decline of 1,003,000, or 7 , compared with the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 was positively impacted by an increase in wealth management fees. In addition, the comparison to the third quarter of 2023 was further impacted by the sale of the GAI assets, with no insurance revenues recognized in the third quarter of 2024 and three months of insurance revenues recognized in the third quarter of 2023.

 Wealth management fees increased 623,000, or 21 , during the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. The increase during the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023 was driven by increased assets under management due to healthy capital markets and continued strong new business results. 
 50 

Insurance revenues declined 2,065,000, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023. The decline in insurance revenues was the result of the sale of the assets of GAI effective June 1, 2024, with no revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2024. For additional information on this sale, see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 Net gains on sales of loans increased 90,000, or 15 , compared with the third quarter of 2023. The increase during the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023 was largely related to a higher volume of sales. Loan sales totaled 40.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 33.8 million during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled 48,546,000, an increase of 3,879,000, or 9 , compared with the first nine months of 2023. The first nine months of 2024 non-interest income was positively impacted by the aforementioned net proceeds of the sale of the GAI assets totaling approximately 38,323,000 and negatively impacted by 34,893,000 related to the net loss recognized on the securities restructuring transaction.

 Insurance revenues declined 2,946,000, or 40 , during the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same period of 2023. The decline during the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 was the result of the sale of the assets of GAI effective June 1, 2024, with only five months of revenue being recognized by the Company. 
 
 The first nine months of 2024 included 38,323,000 in net proceeds for the sale of the GAI assets. For additional information on this sale, see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 Net gains on sales of loans increased 593,000, or 32 , during the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023. The increase during the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 was largely related to a higher volume of sales and modestly higher pricing for loans sold. Loan sales totaled 97.3 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared with 82.0 million during the same period of 2023. 
 
 The net loss on securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 34,788,000 and was primarily related to the net loss recognized on the securities restructuring transaction previously discussed.

 Salaries and benefits decreased 629,000, or 3 , during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. The decline in salaries and benefits during the third quarter of 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 was primarily due to a lower level of full-time equivalent employees resulting from the sale of the assets of GAI during the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Data processing fees increased 437,000, or 16 , during the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. The increase during the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023 was largely driven by costs associated with enhancements to the Company s digital banking systems. 
 
 Professional fees increased 683,000, or 56 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023. The increase during the third quarter of 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 was primarily attributable to the professional fees associated with the pending merger transaction with Heartland. 
 
 Advertising and promotion expense declined 337,000, or 26 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, as the Company began employing a more targeted focus for sponsorship and contributions during 2024. 
 
 Intangible amortization expense consists primarily of amortization associated with the core deposit intangible of acquired deposit portfolios. The core deposit intangibles are generally amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of six to ten years. Intangible Amortization decreased 201,000, or 29 , during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of the prior year with the decrease in the third quarter of 2024 primarily attributable to the accelerated method for which the intangible assets are amortized. 
 
 Other operating expense increased 508,000, or 11 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of the prior year was largely attributable to the timing of the payment of director compensation, increased loan collection costs and changes in the liability for unfunded loan commitments. In previous years, the equity component of director compensation was granted in December. Beginning in 2024, the equity component was granted in July, along with the customary payment of the cash component. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense totaled 110,538,000, an increase of 1,775,000, or 2 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in non-interest expenses during the first half of 2024 was primarily the result of professional fees related to the previously mentioned GAI asset sale and the pending merger transaction with Heartland, which totaled approximately 2,636,000.

 Data processing fees increased 709,000, or 9 , during the first three quarters of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023, largely driven by costs associated with enhancements to the Company s digital banking systems as well as costs related to continued data system enhancements. 
 
 Professional fees increased 2,564,000, or 58 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023. The increase during the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023 was largely attributable to the professional fees associated with the sale of assets of GAI and the pending merger transaction with Heartland totaling 2,636,000. 
 
 Advertising and promotion expense declined 718,000, or 19 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 as the Company began employing a more targeted focus for sponsorships and contributions during 2024. 
 
 Intangible amortization expense consists primarily of amortization associated with the core deposit intangible of acquired deposit portfolios. Intangible Amortization decreased 610,000, or 28 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of the prior year which was largely related to the accelerated method for which the intangible assets are amortized. 
 
 Income Taxes: 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rate was 17.9 and 17.6 , respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company s effective income tax rate was 19.6 and 17.7 , respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the previously mentioned sale of GAI assets and the securities restructuring transaction. The effective tax rate in all periods presented was lower than the blended statutory rate resulting primarily from the Company s tax-exempt investment income on securities, loans and company-owned life insurance, income tax credits generated from affordable housing projects, and income generated by subsidiaries domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 Total assets for the Company totaled 6.261 billion at September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 108.7 million compared with December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets at September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023 was largely related to an increase in total loans and federal funds sold and other short-term investments, partially offset by a decline in the securities portfolio. 
 
 Securities available-for-sale declined 48.8 million as of September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023. The decline at September 30, 2024 in the available-for-sale securities portfolio compared with year end 2023 was largely the result of the Company s utilization of cash flows from the securities portfolio to fund loan growth. 
 
 During June 2024, the Company commenced a securities portfolio restructuring transaction whereby available-for-sale securities totaling approximately 375 million in book value were identified to be sold. As of June 30, 2024, 175 million of securities had been sold with the remaining 200 million sold during early July 2024. The tax-equivalent yield on the bonds sold was approximately 3.12 with a duration of approximately 7 years. Approximately 80 million of the proceeds of the securities sold were reinvested into the securities portfolio as of June 30, 2024 with the remainder reinvested during the third quarter of 2024. 
 53 

September 30, 2024 total loans increased 91.5 million, or 3 on an annualized basis, compared with December 31, 2023. The increase during the first nine months of 2024 compared with December 31, 2023 was broad-based across most segments of the portfolio. Commercial and industrial loans increased 8.6 million, or 2 on an annualized basis, commercial real estate loans increased 58.1 million, or 4 on an annualized basis, and retail loans grew by 31.1 million, or 5 on an annualized basis. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in agricultural loans of 6.3 million, or 2 on an annualized basis, as line of credit utilization declined in this segment. 
 
 The composition of the loan portfolio has remained relatively stable and diversified over the past several years, including 2024. The portfolio is most heavily concentrated in commercial real estate loans at 54 of the portfolio, followed by commercial and industrial loans at 16 of the portfolio, and agricultural loans at 10 of the portfolio.

 The Company s commercial real estate loan portfolio is further diversified by occupancy type, with approximately 77 of the CRE portfolio being non-owner occupied at September 30, 2024 (which is 41 of the Company s overall loan portfolio), and 23 of the CRE portfolio being owner occupied (which is 12 of the Company s total loan portfolio). At December 31, 2023, the Company s commercial real estate loan portfolio was diversified by occupancy type, with approximately 77 of the CRE portfolio being non-owner occupied (which was 41 of the Company s overall loan portfolio), and 23 of the CRE portfolio being owner occupied (which was 12 of the Company s total loan portfolio). 
 
 Commercial real estate loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Like much of the Bank s lending activities, the underwriting standards for commercial real estate are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Once it is determined that the borrower s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, our management examines market conditions and current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. As discussed above, the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of property type, occupancy type, and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce the Bank s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria.

The following table indicates the breakdown of the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial and Industrial Loans and Leases 7,370 8,267 Commercial Real Estate Loans 26,656 25,923 Agricultural Loans 3,901 3,837 Home Equity and Consumer Loans 3,336 2,976 Residential Mortgage Loans 2,861 2,762 Unallocated Total Allowance for Credit Losses 44,124 43,765 
 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses totaled 44.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 43.8 million at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.09 of period-end loans at September 30, 2024 compared with 1.10 at December 31, 2023. Under the CECL model, certain acquired loans continue to carry a fair value discount as well as an allowance for credit losses. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held net discounts on acquired loans of 3.1 million. 
 
 The following is an analysis of the Company s non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 Non-performing Assets: (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Non-accrual Loans 9,701 9,136 Past Due Loans (90 days or more) 55 Total Non-performing Loans 9,701 9,191 Other Real Estate Total Non-performing Assets 9,701 9,191 Restructured Loans Non-performing Loans to Total Loans 0.24 0.23 Non-performing Assets to Period End Assets 0.15 0.15 Allowance for Credit Loss to Non-performing Loans 454.84 476.17 
 
 The following table presents non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more still on accrual by class of loans: 
 Non-Accrual Loans Loans Past Due 90 Days or More Still Accruing September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial and Industrial Loans and Leases 3,214 3,707 Commercial Real Estate Loans 2,173 1,889 55 Agricultural Loans 1,132 879 Home Equity Loans 794 1,033 Consumer Loans 370 253 Residential Mortgage Loans 2,018 1,375 Total 9,701 9,136 55 
 
 Non-performing assets totaled 9.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 9.2 million at December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets represented 0.15 of total assets at September 30, 2024 consistent with 0.15 at year-end 2023. Non-performing loans totaled 9.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 9.2 million at December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans represented 0.24 of total loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.23 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 September 30, 2024 total deposits increased 18.3 million, or approximately 1 on an annualized basis, compared to December 31, 2023. The Company has continued to see customer movement from both interest bearing and non-interest bearing transactional accounts to time deposits due primarily to a higher interest rate environment. Non-interest bearing deposits have remained relatively stable as a percent of total deposits with September 30, 2024 non-interest deposits totaling 27 of total deposits while non-interest deposits totaled 28 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. The deposit base remains diverse with stable and manageable exposure to uninsured and uncollaterized deposits of approximately 22 of total deposits.

 Capital Resources: 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, shareholders equity increased by 81.0 million to 744.6 million compared with 663.6 million at year-end 2023. The increase in shareholders equity was primarily attributable to increased retained earnings of 36.7 million due to net income of 60.6 million. Partially offsetting the increase in retained earnings was the payment of 23.9 million in shareholder dividends. 
 
 Shareholders equity represented 12 of total assets at September 30, 2024 and 11.0 of total assets at December 31, 2023. Shareholders equity included 183.5 million of goodwill and other intangible assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 186.7 million of goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2023. 
 
 In January 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase up to 1.0 million shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. On a share basis, the amount of common stock subject to the repurchase plan represented approximately 3 of the Company s outstanding shares on the date it was approved. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the plan, and the plan may be discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and share price of shares purchased under the repurchase plan will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend upon such factors as the market price of the stock, general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements. The Company has not repurchased any shares of common stock under the repurchase plan. 
 
 Federal banking regulations provide guidelines for determining the capital adequacy of bank holding companies and banks. These guidelines provide for a more narrow definition of core capital and assign a measure of risk to the various categories of assets. The Company is required to maintain minimum levels of capital in proportion to total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet exposures. 
 
 The current risk-based capital rules, as adopted by federal banking regulators, are based upon guidelines developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and reflect various requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act (the Basel III Rules ). The Basel III Rules require banking organizations to, among other things, maintain a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets, a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets, a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets, and a minimum leverage ratio (calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average consolidated assets). In addition, under the Basel III Rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, the Company is required to maintain a 2.5 capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized regulatory capital ratios. At September 30, 2024, the capital levels for the Company and its subsidiary bank remained well in excess of the minimum amounts needed for capital adequacy purposes and the Bank s capital levels met the necessary requirements to be considered well-capitalized.

The table below presents the Company s consolidated and the subsidiary bank s capital ratios under regulatory guidelines:

 The Company adopted the CECL accounting standard under GAAP effective January 1, 2020. The regulatory capital rules applicable to the Company provided an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects of adopting CECL. In addition, as part of pandemic-related legislation enacted during 2020, banking organizations were further permitted to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects of CECL for up to an additional two years. As a result, on January 1, 2022, the Company began the required three-year phase-in by reflecting 25 of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL in its regulatory capital. An additional 25 was phased in on each of January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024, and another 25 will be phased in on January 1, 2025 (at which time the cumulative effects of adopting CECL will have been fully phased into our regulatory capital). Under the five-year transition option, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital that could be deferred until the phase-in period began included both the initial impact of our adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 and 25 of subsequent changes in our allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the two-year period ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Liquidity: 
 
 The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows details the elements of changes in the Company s consolidated cash and cash equivalents. Total cash and cash equivalents increased 80.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ending at 195.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of 67.1 million. Investing activities resulted in net cash inflows of 8.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Financing activities resulted in net cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 4.4 million. 
 
 The Company s primary source of funding is its customer deposits, supplemented by reciprocal deposits. The bank subsidiary of the Company also utilizes short-term funding sources from time to time. These sources consist of overnight federal funds purchased from other financial institutions, secured repurchase agreements that generally mature within one day of the transaction date, and secured overnight variable rate borrowings from the FHLB. These borrowings represent an important source of short-term liquidity for the Company s bank subsidiary. In addition, the Company, as a separate and distinct corporation from its bank and other subsidiaries, also has the ability to borrow funds from other financial institutions and to raise debt or equity capital from the capital markets and other sources. 
 
 The Company s bank subsidiary is authorized by its Board to borrow up to 15 of total assets or approximately 936 million at the FHLB, but availability at September 30, 2024 was limited to approximately 457 million based on the then pledged collateral and outstanding borrowings. In addition, the Company had a borrowing capacity of approximately 291 million at the Federal Reserve Bank as of September 30, 2024, based on the then pledged collateral. The capacity for borrowings from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank could be increased, in each case, by the Company pledging additional available collateral. The Company s Asset/Liability Committee closely monitors the availability of these sources as part of its overall oversight and management of the bank subsidiary s liquidity. 
 
 57 

The parent company is a corporation separate and distinct from its bank and other subsidiaries. The Company uses funds at the parent-company level to pay dividends to its shareholders, to acquire or make other investments in other businesses or their securities or assets, to repurchase its stock from time to time, and for other general corporate purposes including debt service. The parent company does not have access at the parent-company level to the deposits and certain other sources of funds that are available to its bank subsidiary to support its operations. Instead, the parent company has historically derived most of its revenues from dividends paid to the parent company by its bank subsidiary. The Company s banking subsidiary is subject to statutory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the parent company. The parent company has, from time-to-time, supplemented the dividends received from its subsidiaries with borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the parent company had approximately 84.4 million of cash and cash equivalents available to meet its cash flow needs.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Asset/Liability Committee and Boards of Directors of the parent company and its subsidiary bank. Primary market risks which impact the Company s operations are liquidity risk and interest rate risk. 
 
 The liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary bank, which is subject to certain regulatory limitations. The Bank s source of funding is predominately core deposits, maturities of securities, repayments of loan principal and interest, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 
 The Company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios, and by estimating its static interest rate sensitivity position. Another method by which the Company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value NPV ). This method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the NPV of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities. NPV represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities. 
 
 59 

Computations for measuring both net interest income and NPV are based on a number of assumptions, including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments. These computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. In addition, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing both net interest income and NPV. Should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels, the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity. In the event of an interest rate change, prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the modeling. Lastly, the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment. 
 
 The Company from time to time utilizes derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Management continuously evaluates the merits of such interest rate risk products but does not anticipate the use of such products to become a major part of the Company s risk management strategy. 
 
 The table below provides an assessment of the risk to net interest income over the next 12 months in the event of a sudden and sustained 1 and 2 increase and decrease in prevailing interest rates (dollars in thousands). 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity as of September 30, 2024 - Net Interest Income 
 Net Interest Income Changes in Rates Amount Change +2 211,385 (0.16) +1 211,849 0.06 Base 211,720 -1 209,098 (1.24) -2 205,283 (3.04) 
 
 The above table is a measurement of the Company s net interest income at risk, assuming a static balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates. The Company also monitors interest rate risk under other scenarios including a more gradual movement in market interest rates. This type of scenario can at times produce different modeling results in measuring interest rate risk sensitivity. 
 
 The table below provides an assessment of the risk to NPV in the event of a sudden and sustained 1 and 2 increase and decrease in prevailing interest rates (dollars in thousands). 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity as of September 30, 2024 - Net Portfolio Value

 This Item 3 includes forward-looking statements. See Forward-looking Statements and Associated Risks included in Part I, Item 2 of this Report for a discussion of certain factors that could cause the Company s actual exposure to market risk to vary materially from that expressed or implied above. These factors include possible changes in economic conditions; interest rate fluctuations, competitive product and pricing pressures within the Company s markets; and equity and fixed income market fluctuations. Actual experience may also vary materially to the extent that the Company s assumptions described above prove to be inaccurate.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were, as of that date, effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in the Company s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of systems of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective systems of disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving their control objectives. 
 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s third fiscal quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
