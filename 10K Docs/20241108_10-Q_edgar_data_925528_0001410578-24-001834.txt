Hudson received allocation allowances for calendar years 2023 and 2024 equal to approximately of the total HFC consumption allowances, with allowances for future periods to be determined at a later date. In addition, the EPA has finalized its technology transition rule, requiring the manufacturing and installation of lower GWP systems commencing in 2025 and beyond. Reclamation will be critical to maintaining necessary HFC supply levels for the installed base of operating systems to ensure an orderly phasedown so that systems owners are able to recognize the full economic value of their systems through end of life. Reclamation is not subject to the allowance system or restricted from use. On September 20, 2024, the EPA announced the latest actions to phase down HFCs under the AIM Act: 1) Final Refrigerant Management Rule The rule requires better management and reuse of existing HFCs, including by reducing wasteful leaks from equipment and supporting HFC recycling and reclamation. The rule includes requirements for repairing leaky equipment, use of automatic leak detection systems on large refrigeration systems, mandating the use of reclaimed HFCs for certain applications, recovery of HFCs from cylinders before their disposal, and a container tracking system.

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 there was one customer accounting for greater than of the Company s revenues and at September 30, 2023 there were million of accounts receivable from this customer. The loss of a principal customer or a decline in the economic prospects of and/or a reduction in purchases of the Company s products or services by any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results and financial position. reporting unit at September 30, 2024. Other intangible assets that meet certain criteria are amortized over their estimated useful lives. An impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value. An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of a reporting unit. These impairment evaluations use many assumptions and estimates in determining an impairment loss, including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings. If the Company does not achieve its earnings objectives, the assumptions and estimates underlying these impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, which could result in an asset impairment charge that would negatively impact operating results. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company completed its annual impairment test as of October 1 and determined in its qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, resulting in no goodwill impairment. There can be no assurances that future sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions affecting the Company s industry will not occur, which could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. There were goodwill impairment losses recognized in 2023 or the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Some leases include options to purchase, terminate or extend for one or more years. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. At inception, the Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease. Some of the Company s lease arrangements contain lease components (e.g. minimum rent payments) and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, charges, utilities and property taxes). The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allows it to carry forward its historical lease classification, its assessment on whether a contract contains a lease, and its initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to the adoption of the new standard. The Company also elected to combine lease and non-lease components and to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated income statements on a straight line basis over the lease term. The Company s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value, guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating leases are included in Right of use asset, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Long-term lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company s secured incremental borrowing rates or implicit rates, when readily determinable. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease expense is recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.

Termination of 2022 Term Loan Facility On March 2, 2022, Hudson Technologies Company HTC ), an indirect subsidiary of Hudson Technologies, Inc. (the Company ), and the Company s subsidiary Hudson Holdings, Inc., as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers ), and the Company, as guarantor, became obligated under a Credit Agreement (the Term Loan Facility with TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as administrative agent Term Loan Agent and the lender parties thereto (the Term Loan Lenders ). Under the terms of the Term Loan Facility, the Borrowers immediately borrowed million pursuant to a term loan (the Term Loan ), which had a maturity date in March 2027. Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility were used by the Borrowers to repay the outstanding principal amount and related fees and expenses under a prior term loan facility and for other corporate purposes. The Company paid approximately million of term loan deferred financing costs. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company repaid in full the remaining principal balance outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and the FILO Tranche. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility as of September 30, 2024. The Company s ability to comply with these covenants in future quarters may be affected by events beyond the Company s control, including general economic conditions, weather conditions, regulations and refrigerant pricing. Therefore, the Company cannot make any assurance that it will continue to be in compliance during future periods. The Company believes that it will be able to satisfy its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future from anticipated cash flows from operations and available funds under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. Any unanticipated expenses, including, but not limited to, an increase in the cost of refrigerants purchased by the Company, an increase in operating expenses or failure to achieve expected revenues from the Company s RefrigerantSide(R) Services and/or refrigerant sales or additional expansion or acquisition costs that may arise in the future would adversely affect the Company s future capital needs. There can be no assurance that any of the Company s proposed or future plans will be successful, and as such, the Company may require additional capital sooner than anticipated, which capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.

 Cylinder deposits Lease obligations Other current liabilities Total million in cash, paid at the closing, and provides for a further contingent payment of up to million payable, to the extent earned, approximately 18 months from the closing date. The Company estimated the fair value of this contingent earn-out liability to be million as of June 6, 2024 and September 30, 2024. The Company is in the process of finalizing its allocation for the Customer relationships, Tradename, Earnout liability and Goodwill and this may result in potential adjustments to the carrying value of the respective recorded assets and liabilities, establishment of certain additional intangible assets, revisions of useful lives of intangible assets, and the determination of any residual amount that will be allocated to goodwill. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the USA Refrigerants Acquisition: Covenant not to compete Customer relationships Tradename Earn-out liability ) Goodwill Total purchase price The fair values of the acquired intangibles were determined using discounted cash flow models using a discount factor based on an estimated risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. The customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess-earnings method, a form of the income approach. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill, which will be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill largely consists of expected growth in revenue from new customer acquisitions over time. The Company reflected revenue and net income in its consolidated statement of income related to the USA Refrigerants Acquisition for one hundred fifteen days as follows: Net income The following table provides unaudited pro forma total revenues and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as if USA Refrigerants had been acquired on January 1, 2023. The unaudited pro forma results reflect certain adjustments related to the acquisition, such as a step-up in basis in inventory, and amortization expense on intangible assets arising from the acquisition. The pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost synergies or other effects of any planned integration. Accordingly, such pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had

 Net income In relation to the USA Refrigerants Acquisition, the Company incurred million of acquisition costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statement of income for the periods ended September 30, 2024. million of outstanding common stock during 2024 and 2025. Purchases will be funded from the Company s available cash and cash flow. The Company may purchase shares of its common stock on a discretionary basis from time to time through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions or through other means, including by entering into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, in each case, during an open window and when the Company does not possess material non-public information. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements and other general business considerations. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares, totaling , at an average price of per share.

 Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements, contained in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the laws and regulations affecting the industry, changes in the demand and price for refrigerants (including unfavorable market conditions adversely affecting the demand for, and the price of refrigerants), the Company s ability to source refrigerants, regulatory and economic factors, seasonality, competition, litigation, the nature of supplier or customer arrangements that become available to the Company in the future, adverse weather conditions, possible technological obsolescence of existing products and services, possible reduction in the carrying value of long-lived assets, estimates of the useful life of its assets, potential environmental liability, customer concentration, the ability to obtain financing, the ability to meet financial covenants under our financing facility, any delays or interruptions in bringing products and services to market, the timely availability of any requisite permits and authorizations from governmental entities and third parties as well as factors relating to doing business outside the United States, including changes in the laws, regulations, policies, and political, financial and economic conditions, including inflation, interest and currency exchange rates, of countries in which the Company may seek to conduct business, the Company s ability to successfully integrate any assets it acquires from third parties into its operations, and other risks detailed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in the Company s other subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The words believe , expect , anticipate , may , plan , should and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Several of the Company s accounting policies involve significant judgments, uncertainties and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that actual results differ from management s judgments and estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company. On a continuous basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those estimates related to its inventory reserves, goodwill and intangible assets. Inventory For inventory, the Company evaluates both current and anticipated sales prices of its products to determine if a write down of inventory to net realizable value is necessary. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal. The determination if a write-down to net realizable value is necessary is primarily affected by the market prices for the refrigerant gases we sell. Commodity prices generally are affected by a wide range of factors beyond our control, including weather, seasonality, the availability and adequacy of supply, government regulation and policies and general political and economic conditions. At any time, our inventory levels may be substantial and fluctuate, which will materially impact our estimates of net realizable value. Goodwill The Company has made acquisitions that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company applies the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, which among other things, requires the recognition of goodwill (which represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired and identified intangible assets). We test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (on the first day of the fourth quarter) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying value. Other intangible assets that meet certain criteria are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

 An impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value. An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of a reporting unit. These impairment evaluations use many assumptions and estimates in determining an impairment loss, including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings. If the Company does not achieve its earnings objectives, the assumptions and estimates underlying these impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, which could result in an asset impairment charge that would negatively impact operating results. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed our annual impairment test as of October 1 and determined in our qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, resulting in no goodwill impairment. There can be no assurances that future sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions affecting our industry will not occur, which could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. There were no goodwill impairment losses recognized in 2023 or the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Overview The Company is a leading provider of sustainable refrigerant products and services to the Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning and Refrigeration HVACR industry. For nearly three decades, we have demonstrated our commitment to our customers and the environment by becoming one of the United States largest refrigerant reclaimers through multimillion dollar investments in the plants and advanced separation technology required to recover a wide variety of refrigerants and restoring them to Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute AHRI standard for reuse as certified EMERALD Refrigerants . The Company s products and services are primarily used in commercial air conditioning, industrial processing and refrigeration systems, and include refrigerant and industrial gas sales, refrigerant management services consisting primarily of reclamation of refrigerants and RefrigerantSide Services performed at a customer s site, which include system decontamination to remove moisture, oils and other contaminants. Sales of refrigerants continue to represent a significant majority of the Company s revenues. The Company also sells industrial gases to a variety of industry customers, including to users in, or involved with, the US Military. In July 2016, the Company was awarded, as prime contractor, a five-year fixed price contract, including a five-year renewal option which has been exercised, awarded to it by the United States Defense Logistics Agency DLA for the management and supply of refrigerants, compressed gases, cylinders and related items to US Military commands and installations, Federal civilian agencies and foreign militaries. Primary users include the US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Our contract with DLA expires in July 2026. Recent Acquisition On June 6, 2024, the Company s subsidiary Hudson Technologies Company completed the acquisition of substantially all the business assets of USA United Suppliers of America, Inc. (d/b/a USA Refrigerants) USA Refrigerants and B B Jobber Services, Inc. (collectively, the USA Refrigerants Acquisition ). The consideration for the USA Refrigerants Acquisition was approximately 20.7 million in cash, paid at the closing, and provides for a further contingent payment of up to 2.0 million payable, to the extent earned, approximately 18 months from the closing date. USA Refrigerants is a leading refrigerant distributor and distributes, reclaims and packages refrigerant gases for a variety of end uses. Potential benefits of the USA Refrigerants Acquisition include (i) providing a broader customer network which will provide the Company with increased access to refrigerant for reclamation and strengthen the Company s refrigerant distribution capabilities; (ii) adding incremental access to recovered pounds of refrigerants for sale for future periods to support the growth in reclamation; and (iii) enhancing the Company s geographic footprint in the United States. Results of Operations Three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 Revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 61.9 million, a decrease of 14.6 million or 19 from the 76.5 million reported during the comparable 2023 period. The decrease was primarily attributable to 14 lower selling prices and 7 lower volume of refrigerants sold.

 Cost of sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 46.0 million or 74 of sales. The cost of sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 was 45.9 million or 60 of sales. The increase in the cost of sales percentage from 60 to 74 is primarily due to higher cost of sales during the third quarter of 2024, driven by the sale of inventory held at higher price and corresponding reduction in sales price of refrigerants. Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 8.1 million, an increase of 1.3 million from the 6.8 million reported during the comparable 2023 period due to an increase in personnel costs and professional fees. Amortization expense for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively. Interest expense (income) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 0.3) million compared to the 4.4 million of interest expense reported during the comparable 2023 period. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company repaid in full the remaining 32.5 million principal balance outstanding under its term loan facility. In conjunction with this payoff, the Company recorded a non-cash write off of 3.1 million of deferred financing costs in the third quarter of 2023. Other income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 2.3 million. This amount includes proceeds from a litigation settlement of 1.8 million and 0.5 million from the lease opt-out related to the Atlanta facility lease. The income tax expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 1.7 million compared to income tax expense of 5.2 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for federal and state income tax purposes was determined by applying statutory income tax rates to pre-tax income after adjusting for certain items. The net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 7.8 million, a decrease of 5.8 million from the 13.6 million of net income reported during the comparable 2023 period, primarily due to lower sale prices of certain refrigerant sold and higher SG A costs, as described above. Nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 Revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 were 202.5 million, a decrease of 41.7 million or 17 from the 244.2 million reported during the comparable 2024 period. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower selling prices which decreased by 18 offset by 2 higher volume of refrigerants sold. Cost of sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 142.5 million or 70 of sales. The cost of sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was 146.6 million or 60 of sales. The increase in the cost of sales percentage from 60 to 70 is primarily due to higher cost of sales during the first nine months of 2024, driven by the sale of inventory held at higher price and corresponding reduction in sales price of refrigerants. Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 25.0 million, an increase of 3.0 million from the 22.0 million reported during the comparable 2023 period. The increase in SG A was primarily due to increased personnel cost, professional fees, IT Expenses and acquisition costs with approximately 0.7 million considered non-recurring charges. Amortization expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.4 million and 2.1 million, respectively. Interest expense (income) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1) million, compared to the 8.1 million reported during the comparable 2023 period. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company repaid in full the remaining 32.5 million principal balance outstanding under its term loan facility. Other income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 2.3 million. This amount includes proceeds from a litigation settlement of 1.8 million and 0.5 million from the lease opt-out related to the Atlanta facility lease. The income tax expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 7.8 million compared to income tax expense of 17.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for federal and state income tax purposes was determined by applying statutory income tax rates to pre-tax income after adjusting for certain items.

 Net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 27.0 million, a decrease of 21.3 million from the 48.3 million of net income reported during the comparable 2023 period, primarily due to lower sale price of certain refrigerant sold and higher SG A costs, as described above. Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital, which represents current assets less current liabilities, of 156.9 million, an increase of 10.5 million from the working capital of 146.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital is primarily attributable to accounts receivable and inventory. Inventories and trade receivables are principal components of current assets. At September 30, 2024, the Company had inventories of 103.5 million, a decrease of 51.0 million from 154.5 million at December 31, 2023. The Company s ability to sell and replace its inventory on a timely basis and the prices at which it can be sold are subject, among other things, to current market conditions and the nature of supplier or customer arrangements and the Company s ability to source CFC and HCFC based refrigerants (which are no longer being produced) and HFC refrigerants (virgin production currently in the process of being phased down) and HFO refrigerants. At September 30, 2024, the Company had trade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, of 28.5 million, an increase of 3.3 million from 25.2 million at December 31, 2023, mainly due to seasonal timing. The Company typically generates its most significant revenue during the second and third quarters of any given year. The Company s trade receivables are concentrated with various wholesalers, brokers, contractors and end-users within the refrigeration industry that are primarily located in the continental United States. The Company has historically financed its working capital requirements through cash flows from operations, debt, and the issuance of equity securities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 71.1 million, when compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 43.5 million for the comparable 2023 period. As discussed above, selling prices of certain refrigerants declined in 2024. The increase is largely due to the recent acquisition of USA Refrigerants. Another contributory factor was the timing of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 24.4 million compared with net cash used in investing activities of 2.2 million for the comparable 2023 period, mainly due to the recent acquisition of USA Refrigerants as previously discussed and timing of capital expenditures related to capitalization of its ERP system. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 2.6 million compared with net cash used in financing activities of 42.8 million for the comparable 2023 period. The change is primarily because in 2023, the Company paid off 42.8 million of its debt as compared to no debt in 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 326,028 shares, totaling 2.6 million. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were 56.5 million, or approximately 44.1 million higher than the 12.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023. Revolving Credit Facility On March 2, 2022, Hudson Technologies Company HTC and Hudson Holdings, Inc. Holdings ), as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers ), and Hudson Technologies, Inc. (the Company as a guarantor, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Wells Fargo Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lender Agent or Wells Fargo and such other lenders as have or may thereafter become a party to the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. The Amended Wells Fargo facility amended and restated the prior Wells Fargo Facility entered into on December 19, 2019. Under the terms of the Amended Wells Fargo Facility, the Borrowers: (i) immediately borrowed 15 million in the form of a first in last out term loan (the FILO Tranche and (ii) may borrow from time to time, up to 75 million at any time consisting of revolving loans (the Revolving Loans in a maximum amount up to the lesser of 75 million and a borrowing base that is calculated based on the outstanding amount of the Borrowers eligible receivables and eligible inventory, as described in the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. The Amended Wells Fargo Facility also contains a sublimit of 9 million for swing line loans and 2 million for letters of credit. The Company currently has a 0.9 million letter of credit outstanding. The FILO Tranche was repaid in full in July 2023 and may not be reborrowed. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility may be used for working capital needs, certain permitted acquisitions, and to reimburse drawings under letters of credit.

 Interest under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility is payable in arrears on the first day of each month. Interest charges with respect to Revolving Loans are computed on the actual principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding at a rate per annum equal to (A) with respect to Base Rate loans, the sum of (i) a rate per annum equal to the higher of (1) 1.0 , (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5 , (3) one month term SOFR plus 1.0 , and (4) the prime commercial lending rate of Wells Fargo, plus (ii) between 1.25 and 1.75 depending on average monthly undrawn availability and (B) with respect to SOFR loans, the sum of the applicable SOFR rate plus between 2.36 and 2.86 depending on average quarterly undrawn availability. Interest charges with respect to the FILO Tranche were computed on the actual principal amount of FILO Tranche loans outstanding at a rate per annum equal to (A) with respect to Base Rate FILO Tranche loans, the sum of (i) a rate per annum equal to the higher of (1) 1.0 , (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5 , (3) one month term SOFR plus 1.0 , and (4) the prime commercial lending rate of Wells Fargo, plus (ii) 6.5 and (B) with respect to SOFR FILO Tranche loans, the sum of the applicable SOFR rate plus 7.50 . The Amended Wells Fargo Facility also includes a monthly unused line fee ranging from 0.35 to 0.75 per annum determined based upon the level of average Revolving Loans outstanding during the immediately preceding month measured against the total Revolving Loans that may be borrowed under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. In connection with the closing of the Amended Wells Fargo Facility, the Company also entered into a First Amendment to Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2022 (the Amended Revolver Guaranty and Security Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company and certain subsidiaries are continuing to unconditionally guarantee the payment and performance of all obligations owing by Borrowers to Wells Fargo, as Agent for the benefit of the revolving lenders. Pursuant to the Amended Revolver Guaranty and Security Agreement, Borrowers, the Company and certain other subsidiaries are continuing to grant to the Agent, for the benefit of the Wells Fargo Facility lenders, a security interest in substantially all of their respective assets, including receivables, equipment, general intangibles (including intellectual property), inventory, subsidiary stock, real property, and certain other assets. The Amended Wells Fargo Facility contains a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain at all times minimum liquidity (defined as availability under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility plus unrestricted cash) of at least 5 million, of which at least 3 million must be derived from availability. The Amended Wells Fargo Facility also contains a springing covenant, which takes effect only upon a failure to maintain undrawn availability of at least 11.25 million or upon an election by the Borrowers to increase the inventory component of the borrowing base, requiring the Company to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR) of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, as of the end of each trailing period of twelve consecutive months commencing with the month prior to the triggering of the covenant. The FCCR (as defined in the Wells Fargo Facility) is the ratio of (a) EBITDA for such period, minus unfinanced capital expenditures made during such period, to (b) the aggregate amount of (i) interest expense required to be paid (other than interest paid-in-kind, amortization of financing fees, and other non-cash interest expense) during such period, (ii) scheduled principal payments (but excluding principal payments relating to outstanding Revolving Loans under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility), (iii) all net federal, state, and local income taxes required to be paid during such period (provided, that any tax refunds received shall be applied to the period in which the cash outlay for such taxes was made), (iv) all restricted payments paid (as defined in the Amended Wells Fargo Facility) during such period, and (v) to the extent not otherwise deducted from EBITDA for such period, all payments required to be made during such period in respect of any funding deficiency or funding shortfall with respect to any pension plan. The FCCR covenant ceases after the Borrowers have been in compliance therewith for two consecutive months. The Amended Wells Fargo Facility also contains customary non-financial covenants relating to the Company and the Borrowers, including limitations on the Borrowers ability to pay dividends on common stock or preferred stock, and also includes certain events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other obligations, events of bankruptcy and insolvency, certain ERISA events, judgments in excess of specified amounts, impairments to guarantees and a change of control. The Company evaluated the Amended Wells Fargo Facility in accordance with the provisions of ASC 470-50 to determine if the amendment was a modification or an extinguishment of debt and concluded that the amendment was a modification of the original revolving credit facility for accounting purposes. As a result, the Company capitalized an additional 0.9 million of deferred financing costs in connection with the amendment, which, along with the 0.2 million of remaining deferred financing costs of the original revolving facility, is being amortized over the five year term of the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. On June 6, 2024, the Borrowers and the Company entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Limited Consent (the First Amendment with Wells Fargo and the lenders under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. Pursuant to the First Amendment, Wells Fargo and the other lenders consented to the consummation of the USA Refrigerants Acquisition and made certain other technical amendments to the existing Amended Wells Fargo Facility, including the calculation of the borrowing base thereunder. The First Amendment also provided for permitted stock repurchases by the Company in an amount not to exceed 5 million per calendar year, and 15 million in aggregate over the term of the Amended Wells Fargo Facility, upon satisfaction of certain conditions.

 On October 23, 2024, the Borrowers and the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 23, 2024 (the Second Amendment with Wells Fargo and the lenders under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. The Second Amendment amends the provision relating to permitted stock repurchases by the Company, to permit stock repurchases in an amount not to exceed 10 million per calendar year in each of 2024 and 2025 and 5 million in any calendar year thereafter during the term of the Amended Wells Fargo Facility, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, subject to an aggregate cap of 25 million. The commitments under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility will expire and the full outstanding principal amount of the loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, are due and payable in full on March 2, 2027, unless the commitments are terminated and the outstanding principal amount of the loans are accelerated sooner following an event of default or in the event of certain other cross-defaults. Termination of 2022 Term Loan Facility On March 2, 2022, Hudson Technologies Company HTC ), an indirect subsidiary of Hudson Technologies, Inc. (the Company ), and the Company s subsidiary Hudson Holdings, Inc., as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers ), and the Company, as guarantor, became obligated under a Credit Agreement (the Term Loan Facility with TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as administrative agent Term Loan Agent and the lender parties thereto (the Term Loan Lenders ). Under the terms of the Term Loan Facility, the Borrowers immediately borrowed 85 million pursuant to a term loan (the Term Loan ), which had a maturity date in March 2027. Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility were used by the Borrowers to repay the outstanding principal amount and related fees and expenses under a prior term loan facility and for other corporate purposes. The Company paid approximately 4.3 million of term loan deferred financing costs. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company repaid in full the remaining principal balance outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and the FILO Tranche. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility as of September 30, 2024. The Company s ability to comply with these covenants in future quarters may be affected by events beyond the Company s control, including general economic conditions, weather conditions, regulations and refrigerant pricing. Therefore, we cannot make any assurance that we will continue to be in compliance during future periods. The Company believes that it will be able to satisfy its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future from anticipated cash flows from operations and available funds under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. Any unanticipated expenses, including, but not limited to, an increase in the cost of refrigerants purchased by the Company, an increase in operating expenses or failure to achieve expected revenues from the Company s RefrigerantSide Services and/or refrigerant sales or additional expansion or acquisition costs that may arise in the future would adversely affect the Company s future capital needs. There can be no assurance that the Company s proposed or future plans will be successful, and as such, the Company may require additional capital sooner than anticipated, which capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Inflation Inflation, historically or the recent increase, has had an impact on salaries and wages but less so on other aspects of the Company s operations. Reliance on Suppliers and Customers The Company participates in an industry that is highly regulated, and changes in the regulations affecting our business could affect our operating results. Currently the Company purchases virgin HCFC and HFC refrigerants and reclaimable, primarily HCFC and CFC, refrigerants from suppliers and its customers. Under the Clean Air Act the phase-down of future production of certain virgin HCFC refrigerants commenced in 2010 and has been fully phased out by the year 2020, and production of all virgin HCFC refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by the year 2030. To the extent that the Company is unable to source sufficient quantities of refrigerants or is unable to obtain refrigerants on commercially reasonable terms or experiences a decline in demand and/or price for refrigerants sold by it, the Company could realize reductions in revenue from refrigerant sales, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results and financial position.

 For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 there was one customer accounting for greater than 10 of the Company s revenues and at September 30, 2024 there were 4.9 million of accounts receivable from this customer. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 there was one customer accounting for greater than 10 of the Company s revenues and at September 30, 2023 there were 19.7 million of accounts receivable from this customer. The loss of a principal customer or a decline in the economic prospects of and/or a reduction in purchases of the Company s products or services by any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results and financial position. Seasonality and Weather Conditions and Fluctuations in Operating Results The Company s operating results vary from period to period as a result of weather conditions, requirements of potential customers, non-recurring refrigerant and service sales, availability and price of refrigerant products (virgin or reclaimable), changes in reclamation technology and regulations, timing in introduction and/or retrofit or replacement of refrigeration equipment, the rate of expansion of the Company s operations, and by other factors. The Company s business is seasonal in nature with peak sales of refrigerants occurring in the first nine months of each year. During past years, the seasonal decrease in sales of refrigerants has resulted in losses particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. In addition, to the extent that there is unseasonably cool weather throughout the spring and summer months, which would adversely affect the demand for refrigerants, there would be a corresponding negative impact on the Company. Delays or inability in securing adequate supplies of refrigerants at peak demand periods, lack of refrigerant demand, increased expenses, declining refrigerant prices and a loss of a principal customer could result in significant losses. There can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not occur and result in a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position and significant losses. The Company believes that to a lesser extent there is a similar seasonal element to RefrigerantSide Service revenues as refrigerant sales. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See recent accounting pronouncements set forth in Note 1 of the financial statements contained in this report. Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates on the Amended Wells Fargo Facility. The Amended Wells Fargo Facility is a 75 million secured facility with a 0.0 million outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. Future interest rate changes on our borrowing under the Amended Wells Fargo Facility may have an impact on our consolidated results of operations. Refrigerant Market We are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in the demand, price and availability of refrigerants. To the extent that the Company is unable to source sufficient quantities of refrigerants or is unable to obtain refrigerants on commercially reasonable terms or experiences a decline in demand and/or price for refrigerants sold by the Company, the Company could realize reductions in revenue from refrigerant sales or write-downs of inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.

 Item 4 - Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Furthermore, the Company s controls and procedures can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely basis. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded there were no such changes.
