 Master Netting Agreements and the Right of Offset. As applicable, the Company historically has had master netting agreements with all of its commodity derivative counterparties and has presented its derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty on a net basis in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the netting provisions, the Company's maximum amount of loss under commodity derivative transactions due to credit risk was limited to the net amounts due from its counterparties. 

Because we did not designate any of our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts were recognized as gains and losses in the earnings of the relevant period. Changes in fair value were principally measured based on a comparison of future prices to the contract price at the end of the period.

 of the settling individual defendants to fund a proposed settlement of million with those defendants. The Company refused and filed an action in Oklahoma state court seeking a declaratory judgment that the defendants were not entitled to indemnification. The insurance carriers funded the settlement of million and filed a counterclaim, which seeks reimbursement of the million settlement, with each carrier to receive their funded portion of the million. The Company disputes any liability, as it believes it has meritorious defenses. Considering the status of this matter, and the facts, circumstances and legal theories thereto, the Company is not able to determine the likelihood of an outcome. The Company has not established any liabilities relating to this matter. 
 
 In addition to the matters described above, the Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings, which are being handled and defended by the Company in the ordinary course of business.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We anticipate being able to utilize these deferred tax assets based on the generation of future income. A change in the estimate of future income could cause the valuation allowance to be adjusted in subsequent periods. The Company recognized million in federal and state income tax benefit for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and federal or state income tax expense or benefit for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 382 addresses company ownership changes and specifically limits the utilization of certain deductions and other tax attributes on an annual basis following an ownership change. As a result of the Chapter 11 reorganization and related transactions, the Company experienced an ownership change within the meaning of IRC Section 382 during 2016 that subjected certain of the Company s tax attributes, including net operating losses ("NOLs"), to an IRC Section 382 limitation. This limitation has not resulted in cash taxes for any period subsequent to the ownership change. Since the 2016 ownership change, the Company has generated additional NOLs and other tax attributes that are not currently subject to an IRC Section 382 limitation. The Company's ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to reduce taxable income and income taxes could be materially impacted by a future IRC 382 ownership change. Future transactions involving the Company's stock including those outside of the Company's control could cause an IRC 382 ownership change resulting in a limitation on tax attributes currently not limited and a more restrictive limitation on tax attributes currently subject to the previous IRC 382 limitation. The Company adopted the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, as amended on March 16, 2021 and June 20, 2023, in order to protect the Company s ability to use its tax NOLs and certain other tax benefits. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately billion of federal NOL carryforwards, net of NOLs expected to expire unused due to the 2016 IRC Section 382 limitation. Of the billion of federal NOL carryforwards, billion expire during the years 2025 through 2037, while the remaining billion do not have an expiration date. In addition, the Company had approximately billion of state NOL carryforwards, net of NOLs expected to expire unused due to the 2016 IRC Section 382 limitation. Of the billion in state NOL carryforwards, million are derived from states the Company currently does not operate in. million do not have an expiration date and million will begin expiring in 2026 through 2037. Additionally, the Company had federal tax credits in excess of million which begin expiring in 2029. 
 
 The Company did not have unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company s only taxing jurisdiction is the United States (federal and state). The Company s tax years 2020 to present remain open for federal examination. Additionally, tax years 2005 through 2019 remain subject to examination for the purpose of determining the amount of federal NOL and other carryforwards. The number of years open for state tax audits varies, depending on the state, but are generally from three to .

 million shares, which include million shares of common stock, par value per share common stock and million shares of preferred stock, par value per share.

Further, at September 30, 2024, the Company had million of unvested restricted stock awards, million shares of unvested restricted stock units, million unvested stock options outstanding and an immaterial number of unvested performance share units. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program. In May 2023, the Company's Board of Directors (the Board approved a share repurchase program (the Program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of million of the Company s outstanding common stock with the Company s cash on hand. The Program replaced the prior share repurchase program previously approved by the Board in August 2021 of million. Purchases under the Program are intended to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The Program does not require any specific number of shares to be acquired, and can be modified or discontinued by the Board at any time. The Company did not repurchase any common stock under the Program or the prior share repurchase program during the three or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 
 Dividends . In January 2024, the Board approved a one-time cash dividend of per share of the Company's common stock, which was paid on February 20, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 5, 2024. The aggregate total payout was approximately million. Additionally, in March 2024, the Board increased the on-going quarterly dividend to per share which was paid in March, May, and August 2024. The aggregate total payout was million. The per share dividend is subject to quarterly approval by the Board. Dividend payments for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 totaled million, which included million of dividends on vested stock awards. Cash dividends for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023 totaled million. 
 
 The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan . On July 1, 2020, the Board declared a dividend distribution of right (a Right for each outstanding share of the Company s common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 13, 2020. On June 20, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to extend the expiration time of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan from July 1, 2023 to July 1, 2026. Each Right entitles its holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company, par value per share, at an exercise price of per Right, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the tax benefits preservation plan, dated as of July 1, 2020, as amended, between the Company and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent (and any successor rights agent, the Rights Agent ). The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan will expire on the earliest of: (i) the time at which the Rights are redeemed pursuant to the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, (ii) the time at which the Rights are exchanged pursuant to the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, (iii) the closing of any merger or other acquisition transaction involving the Company pursuant to an agreement of the type described in Section 13(f) of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, at which time, the Rights are terminated, (iv) the time at which the Board determines that the NOLs are utilized in all material respects or that an ownership change under Section 382 would not adversely impact in any material respect the time period in which the Company could use the NOLs, or materially impair the amount of the NOLs that could be used by the Company in any particular time period, for applicable tax purposes and (v) the Close of Business on July 1, 2026. At the Company's 2024 Annual Meeting held on June 12, 2024, the Company's stockholders approved the extension of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to July 1, 2026. 
 
 The Company adopted the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, as amended on March 16, 2021, and June 20, 2023, in order to protect shareholder value against a possible limitation on the Company s ability to use its tax net operating losses (the NOLs and certain other tax benefits to reduce potential future U.S. federal income tax obligations. The NOLs are a valuable asset to the Company, which may inure to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. However, if the Company experiences an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), its ability to fully utilize the NOLs and certain other tax benefits will be substantially limited and the timing of the usage of the NOLs and such other benefits could be substantially delayed, which could significantly impair the value of those assets. Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the Company s stock owned by or more of its -percent shareholders (as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code) increases by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholder or shareholders at any time over a period. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to prevent against such an ownership change by deterring any person or group from acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of the Company s securities.

 Recent Events 
 
 On August 30, 2024, the Company closed on its previously announced acquisition of certain producing oil and natural gas properties in the Cherokee Play of the Western Anadarko Basin for 123.8 million, before customary post-closing adjustments. See Note 5 Acquisitions to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report and Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 2 for additional information. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, Mr. Jonathan Frates notified the Board of Directors (the Board of the Company that he will resign as Chairman of the Board, effective October 1, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the Board announced that it had appointed (i) Mr. Frates to serve as the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective October 21, 2024 and (ii) Mr. Brandon Brown to serve as the Company s Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, effective October 21, 2024. Mr. Brown will no longer serve as Chief Financial Officer upon the commencement of Mr. Frates role as Chief Financial Officer on October 21, 2024. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company announced that the Board had appointed Mr. Vincent Intrieri, a Board member, to serve as the Company s Chairman of the Board, effective October 1, 2024, to fill the vacancy following Mr. Frates resignation from the Board. Mr. Intrieri will also join the Board s Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees. 
 
 On August 6, 2024, the Board declared a cash dividend of 0.11 per share of the Company s common stock, which was paid on August 30, 2024 to shareholders of record on August 16, 2024. The total payout was approximately 4.1 million. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 We remain committed to growing the cash value and generation capability of our asset base in a safe, responsible and efficient manner, while prudently allocating capital to high-return, organic growth projects. These standalone projects include (1) Development in the Cherokee Shale Play, which includes completions of four drilled uncompleted DUC wells, and initiating a drilling program, (2) Production Optimization program through artificial lift conversions to more efficient and cost-effective systems and high-graded heel completion projects in the NW Stack and (3) opportunistic leasing that could bolster future development and complement the recently acquired Cherokee assets. Our legacy non-Cherokee leasehold remains approximately 99 held by production, which cost-effectively maintains our development option over a reasonable tenor. These legacy non-Cherokee assets have higher relative gas content for which prices are not yet at optimal levels to resume development or material reactivations. We will continue to monitor forward-looking commodity prices, project results, costs and other factors that could influence returns and adjust capital allocations accordingly. These and other factors will continue to shape our development decisions for the remainder of the year and beyond. 
 
 We also remain vigilant in evaluating further merger and acquisition opportunities, with consideration of our strong balance sheet and commitment to our capital return program. 

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 
 Our consolidated revenues and cash flows are generated from the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGL. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices received for our production, the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGL we produce, and our ability to find and economically develop and produce our reserves. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGL fluctuate widely and are difficult to predict. To provide information on the general trend in pricing, the average New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") prices for oil and natural gas are shown in the tables below:

 In order to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations, from time to time we may enter into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our anticipated future oil, natural gas and NGL production as discussed in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. During periods where the strike prices for our commodity derivative contracts are below market prices at the time of settlement, we may not fully benefit from increases in the market price of oil and natural gas. Conversely, during periods of declining oil and natural gas market prices, our commodity derivative contracts may partially offset declining revenues and cash flows to the extent strike prices for our contracts are above market prices at the time of settlement. See Note 3 Derivatives to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our commodity derivatives.

 Variances in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues attributable to changes in the average prices received for our production and total production volumes sold for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 are shown in the table below (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 oil, natural gas and NGL revenues 38,149 114,715 Change due to production volumes (459) (7,579) Change due to average prices (7,633) (20,819) 2024 oil, natural gas and NGL revenues 30,057 86,317 
 
 Oil, natural gas, and NGL revenues decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices and production volumes. Production volumes decreased primarily due to the natural declines of our producing wells, partially offset by one month of production for our newly acquired wells in the Cherokee Play of the Western Anadarko Basin. The Company did not drill any new wells in the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. See "Item 1A Risk Factors" included in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion of the potential impact these events may have on our future revenues. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Lease operating expenses 9,104 11,450 (2,346) 28,734 31,946 (3,212) Production, ad valorem, and other taxes 1,813 2,031 (218) 5,550 8,522 (2,972) Depreciation and depletion oil and natural gas 8,345 4,217 4,128 16,771 11,415 5,356 Depreciation and amortization other 1,605 1,637 (32) 4,947 4,870 77 Total operating expenses 20,867 19,335 1,532 56,002 56,753 (751) Lease operating expenses /Boe) 5.82 7.22 (1.40) 6.68 6.83 (0.15) Production, ad valorem, and other taxes /Boe) 1.16 1.28 (0.12) 1.29 1.82 (0.53) Depreciation and depletion oil and natural gas /Boe) 5.34 2.66 2.68 3.90 2.44 1.46 Production, ad valorem, and other taxes of oil, natural gas and NGL revenue) 6.0 5.3 0.7 6.4 7.4 (1.0) 
 
 Lease operating expenses decreased for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a reduction in utility costs and expense workovers. 
 
 Production, ad valorem, and other taxes for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices, sales volumes, and related revenues. Production, ad valorem, and other taxes for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased as a percentage of oil, natural gas and NGL revenue primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes. Production, ad valorem, and other taxes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased as a percentage of oil, natural gas and NGL revenue primarily due to a decrease in ad valorem taxes as a result of decreased valuation assessments on our oil and gas properties. 
 
 The increase in depreciation and depletion for oil and natural gas properties was primarily the result of our acquisition in the Cherokee Play of the Western Anadarko Basin during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which increased the value of our proved properties and subsequently our combined depletion rate for the period ended September 30, 2024.

Impairment 
 
 A ceiling limitation calculation is performed at the end of each quarter. If the full cost pool balance exceeds the ceiling limitation, an impairment of the full cost pool is required. Calculation of the full cost ceiling test is based on, among other factors, trailing twelve-month first-day-of-the-month index prices SEC prices as adjusted for price differentials and other contractual arrangements. The SEC prices utilized in the calculation of proved reserves included in the full cost ceiling test at September 30, 2024 were 78.64 per barrel of oil and 2.21 per MMBtu of natural gas, before price differential adjustments. 
 
 The ceiling limitation was not exceeded; therefore, no full cost ceiling limitation impairments were recorded during the three or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. During certain periods within the past five years, the SEC prices used in the full cost ceiling test have been lower than the SEC prices used for the September 30, 2024 full cost ceiling test and resulted in material ceiling limitation impairments. Full cost pool ceiling limitation impairments have no impact to our cash flow or liquidity. 
 
 Based on the SEC prices over the trailing ten months ended October 31, 2024, as well as two months of NYMEX strip pricing for November and December of 2024 as of October 25, 2024, we estimate the SEC prices utilized in the December 31, 2024 full cost ceiling test may be 75.95 per barrel of oil and 2.17 per MMBtu of natural gas (the "estimated fourth quarter prices"). Applying these estimated fourth quarter prices, and holding all other inputs constant to those used in the calculation of our September 30, 2024 ceiling test, we expect that no full cost ceiling limitation impairment is indicated for the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Any actual full cost ceiling limitation impairment recognized in future quarters may fluctuate significantly from projected amounts based on the outcome of numerous other factors such as declines in the actual trailing twelve-month SEC prices, lower NGL pricing, changes in estimated future development costs and operating expenses, and other adjustments to our levels of proved reserves. 
 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 
 Other operating expenses for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following (in thousands): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change General and administrative 2,304 2,619 (315) 8,686 8,004 682 Restructuring expenses 260 42 218 341 343 (2) Employee termination benefits 19 (19) (Gain) loss on derivative contracts (1,866) (1,866) (1,866) (1,447) (419) Other operating (income) expense, net (31) 31 24 (152) 176 Total other operating expenses 698 2,630 (1,932) 7,185 6,767 418 
 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a decrease in personnel costs and professional fees. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase in personnel costs.

Tabl e of Contents 

 Our derivative contracts were not designated as accounting hedges and, as a result, changes in their fair values were recorded each quarter as a component of operating expenses. Internally, management has historically viewed the settlement of commodity derivative contracts at contractual maturity as adjustments to the price received for oil, natural gas and NGL production to determine effective prices. In general, cash is received on settlement of contracts due to lower oil and natural gas prices at the time of settlement, compared to the contract price for our commodity derivative contracts; and, cash is paid on settlement of contracts due to higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices at the time of settlement, compared to the contract price for our commodity derivative contracts. See further discussion of derivative contracts in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in Part I of this Quarterly Report. 

Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Our other income (expense) for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the table below (in thousands): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other income (expense) 
 Interest income (expense), net 1,553 2,455 6,742 7,782 Other income (expense), net 31 92 88 Total other income 1,553 2,486 6,834 7,870 
 
 Interest income, net during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily comprised of interest income on cash deposits. The decrease in interest income, net is due to the Company s lower cash balance primarily as a result of our acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, capital expenditures and quarterly dividend payments. 
 
 Income tax (benefit) 
 
 We recorded income tax benefit of 15.4 million for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 which directly relates to our partial valuation allowance release. As the partial valuation allowance release as of September 30, 2024 was higher than the partial valuation allowance release as of December 31, 2023 of 50.6 million, we recognized 15.4 million of deferred federal and state income tax benefit for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash was 94.1 million. We expect our cash on hand and cash from operations to be adequate to meet our short and long-term liquidity needs. We had no outstanding term or revolving debt obligations as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Working Capital and Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity for the next year include cash flows from operations and cash on hand. 
 
 On August 30, 2024, the Company closed on its previously announced acquisition of certain producing oil and natural gas properties in the Cherokee Play of the Western Anadarko Basin. The acquisition had an effective date of July 1, 2024 and the the consolidated income statements include activity for September 2024. After customary closing adjustments, the Company paid 123.8 million in cash on hand, of which a portion is held in escrow. As part of the joint development agreement in our Cherokee Play Acquisition, the Company completed and participated in four wells, and could spud up to two wells in the fourth quarter. See Note 5 Acquisitions to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information. The condensed consolidated statement of cash flows contains 2.2 million in acquisition of assets related to a separate acquisition of producing properties within our incumbent area of operations in Mid-Con. 
 
 Cash payments for acquisitions of 126.0 million, dividend payments to shareholders of 68.2 million, and capital expenditures of 13.6 million were the primary drivers in the reduction of working capital to 66.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 228.5 million at December 31, 2023. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash flows from operations of 47.9 million.

Tabl e of Contents 

 Cash Flows 
 
 Our cash flows from operations are substantially dependent on current and future prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, which historically have been, and may continue to be, volatile. Cash flows from operations are also affected by timing of cash receipts and disbursements and changes in other working capital assets and liabilities. 
 
 Our cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the following table and discussed below (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by operating activities 47,940 89,359 Cash flows used in investing activities (138,662) (35,531) Cash flows used in financing activities (1) 
 (69,141) (79,053) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (159,863) (25,225) 
 __________________ 
 (1) Includes 68.2 million and 77.8 million in dividend payments for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 The decrease in cash flows from operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in revenues from lower commodity prices and sales volumes from the natural declines of our producing wells, partially offset by one month of production for our newly acquired wells in the Cherokee Play of the Western Anadarko Basin. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Our cash flows used in investing activities during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect acquisitions of oil and gas properties for 126.0 million and 11.2 million , and capital expenditures of 13.6 million and 25.7 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to completion, production optimization and leasing activities. However, the Company did not bring online any new wells in the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital expenditures for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Capital Expenditures Drilling, completion, and capital workovers 6,562 21,773 Leasehold and geophysical 6,893 (109) Capital expenditures (on an accrual basis) 13,455 21,664 Acquisitions 125,950 11,232 Capital expenditures, including acquisitions 139,405 32,896 Changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 258 5,263 Inventory material transfers to oil and natural gas properties (141) (1,246) Total cash paid for capital expenditures 139,522 36,913

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 68.2 million in cash dividends, 0.4 million of cash used for tax withholdings paid in exchange for shares withheld on employee vested stock awards that were settled by net exercise, and finance lease payments of 0.6 million. Since 2023, the Company has paid cash dividends totaling 149.7 million, which represents 3.50 per share in special dividends and 0.53 per share in quarterly dividends for a total of 4.03 per share in cash dividends. Cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of 77.8 million in cash dividends, 0.9 million of cash used for tax withholdings paid in exchange for shares withheld on employee vested stock awards that were settled by net exercise, and finance lease payments of 0.4 million. Net exercises of stock awards allows the holder of a stock award to tender back to us a number of shares at fair value upon the vesting of such stock award, that equals the employee payroll tax obligation due. We then remit a cash payment to the relevant taxing authority on behalf of the employee for their payroll tax obligations resulting from the vesting of their stock award. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our contractual obligations included asset retirement obligations, leases and other individually insignificant obligations. Additionally, we have certain financial instruments representing potential commitments that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including surety bonds. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in our balance sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the surety bonds or other instruments. 
 
 There were no other significant changes in total contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements from those reported in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Form 10-K . For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, newly adopted and recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 1 Basis of Presentation to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. We did not have any material changes in critical accounting policies, estimates, judgments and assumptions during the first nine months of 2024.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 General 
 
 This discussion provides information about the financial instruments we have historically used to manage commodity prices. All contracts were settled in cash and did not require the actual delivery of a commodity at settlement. Additionally, our exposure to credit risk and interest rate risk is also discussed. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk . Our most significant market risk relates to the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGLs. Due to the historical price volatility of these commodities, from time to time, we have historically entered, depending upon our view of opportunities under the then-prevailing current market conditions, we enter into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our anticipated production volumes for the purpose of reducing the impact of the variability of oil and natural gas prices . 
 
 We have used, and may use, a variety of commodity-based derivative contracts, including fixed price swaps, basis swaps and collars. At September 30, 2024, the Company's open derivative contracts consisted of natural gas and NGL commodity derivative contracts under which we will receive a fixed price for the contract and pay a floating market price to the counterparty over a specified period for a contracted volume. These commodity derivative contracts consisted of the following: 
 
 Period Type of Derivative Instrument Index (1) 
 Daily Volume (Bbl) Weighted Average Price Per Barrel October 2024 - December 2024 Swaps Mont Belvieu OPIS 400 42.76 October 2024 - December 2024 Swaps NYMEX WTI 900 74.85 January 2025 - December 2025 Swaps Mont Belvieu OPIS 300 39.69 January 2025 - December 2025 Swaps NYMEX WTI 500 71.60 January 2026 - June 2026 Swaps NYMEX WTI 300 68.67 (1) NGL swaps exclude ethane 

There were no open derivative contracts at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Because we historically have not designated any of our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts are recognized as gains and losses in current period earnings. As a result, and when applicable, current period earnings could have been significantly affected by changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts. Changes in fair value were principally measured based on a comparison of future prices to the contract price at the end of the period. 

The following table summarizes derivative activity for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Gain) loss on derivative contracts (1,866) (1,866) (1,447) Settlement gains (losses) on derivative contracts 199 199 5,876 

See Note 3 Derivatives to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our commodity derivatives.

Tabl e of Contents 

 Credit Risk. As applicable, we are exposed to credit risk related to counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. All of our derivative transactions are carried out in the over-the-counter market. The use of derivative transactions in over-the-counter markets involves the risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the financial terms of the transactions. The counterparties for all of our current derivative transactions have had and continue to have an investment grade credit rating. We monitor the credit ratings of our derivative counterparties and considered our counterparties credit default risk ratings in determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts have historically been with multiple counterparties to minimize exposure to any individual counterparty, and in addition our counterparties have been large financial institutions. 
 
 We do not require collateral or other security from counterparties to support derivative instruments. We have master netting agreements with our derivative contract counterparties, which allows us to net our derivative assets and liabilities by commodity type with the same counterparty. As a result of the netting provisions, our maximum amount of loss under derivative transactions due to credit risk is limited to the net amounts due from the counterparties under the commodity derivative contracts. Therefore, we are not required to post additional collateral under our commodity derivative contracts. 
 
 We are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our joint interest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures on wells and properties we operate. Historically, our credit losses on joint interest receivables have been immaterial.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, the Company performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Information regarding our risk factors appears in Item 1A. of our 2023 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These risk factors describe some of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect our business or that could otherwise result in changes that differ materially from our expectations. 

ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Our current equity-based compensation plans include provisions that allow for the net exercise of share-settled vested awards by all plan participants. In a net exercise, any required payroll taxes, federal withholding taxes and exercise price of the shares due from the share-based award holders are settled by having the holder tender back to us a number of shares at fair value equal to the amounts due. Net exercises are treated as purchases and retirements of shares.
