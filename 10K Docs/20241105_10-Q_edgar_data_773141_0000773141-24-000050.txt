 We have identified each homebuilding division as an operating segment. Our homebuilding operating segments have been aggregated into the reportable segments noted below because they are similar in the following regards: (1) economic characteristics; (2) housing products; (3) class of homebuyer; (4) regulatory environments; and (5) methods used to construct and sell homes. Our homebuilding reportable segments for the comparable periods include operations in the following states: 
 West (Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and Washington) 
 Mountain (Colorado, Idaho and Utah) 
 East (Alabama, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia) 
 Our financial services business consists of the following operating segments: (1) HomeAmerican Mortgage Corporation HomeAmerican (2) Allegiant Insurance Company, Inc., A Risk Retention Group Allegiant (3) StarAmerican Insurance Ltd. StarAmerican (4) American Home Insurance Agency, Inc.; and (5) American Home Title and Escrow Company. Due to its contributions to consolidated pretax income, we consider HomeAmerican to be a reportable segment mortgage operations ). The remaining operating segments have been aggregated into reportable segment other because they do not individually exceed 10 percent of: (1) consolidated revenue; (2) the greater of (a) the combined reported profit of all operating segments that did not report a loss or (b) the positive value of the combined reported loss of all operating segments that reported losses; or (3) consolidated assets. 
 Corporate is a non-operating segment that develops and implements strategic initiatives and supports our operating divisions by centralizing key administrative functions such as finance, treasury, information technology, insurance, risk management, litigation and human resources. A portion of the expenses incurred by Corporate are allocated to the homebuilding operating segments based on their respective percentages of assets and, to a lesser degree, a portion of Corporate expenses are allocated to the financial services segments. A majority of Corporate s personnel and resources are primarily dedicated to activities relating to the homebuilding segments, and, therefore, the balance of any unallocated Corporate expenses is included in the homebuilding operations section of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

 The Merger Agreement further provides that, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value per share, of Merger Sub shall be automatically converted into and become fully paid and non-assessable share of Surviving Corporation Stock.

 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Debt securities. Our debt securities consist of U.S. government treasury securities with original maturities upon acquisition of less than six months and are treated as available-for-sale investments and, as such, are recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value initially recorded through other comprehensive income. Debt securities are reviewed on a regular basis for impairment. There were no impairments recorded during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Total Debt Securities 
 Mortgage loans held-for-sale, net. Our mortgage loans held-for-sale, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, include (1) mortgage loans held-for-sale that are under commitments to sell and (2) mortgage loans held-for-sale that are not under commitments to sell. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value under commitments to sell. The fair value for those loans was based on quoted market prices for those mortgage loans, which are Level 2 fair value inputs. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of mortgage loans held-for-sale that were not under commitments to sell. The fair value for those loans was primarily based upon the estimated market price received from an outside party, which is a Level 2 fair value input. 
 Gains (losses) on mortgage loans, net, are included as a component of revenues in the financial services section of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we

 Derivative and financial instruments, net. Our derivatives and financial instruments, which include (1) interest rate lock commitments, (2) forward sales of mortgage-backed securities, (3) mandatory delivery forward loan sale commitments and (4) best-effort delivery forward loan sale commitments, are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on market prices for similar instruments. 
 For the financial assets and liabilities that the Company does not reflect at fair value, the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments. 
 Cash and cash equivalents (excluding debt securities with an original maturity of three months or less), restricted cash, trade and other receivables, prepaids and other assets, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities and borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Fair value approximates carrying value. 
 Mortgage Repurchase Facility. The debt associated with our mortgage repurchase facility (see Note 18 for further discussion) is at floating rates that approximate current market rates and have relatively short-term maturities, generally within days. The fair value approximates carrying value and is based on Level 2 inputs.

 Total inventories 
 
 Our inventories are primarily associated with communities where we intend to construct and sell homes, including models and unsold homes. Costs capitalized to land and land under development primarily include: (1) land costs; (2) land development costs; (3) entitlement costs; (4) capitalized interest; (5) engineering fees; and (6) title insurance, real property taxes and closing costs directly related to the purchase of the land parcel. Components of housing completed or under construction primarily include: (1) land costs transferred from land and land under development; (2) direct construction costs associated with a house; (3) real property taxes, engineering fees, permits and other fees; (4) capitalized interest; and (5) indirect construction costs, which include field construction management salaries and benefits, utilities and other construction related costs. Land costs are transferred from land and land under development to housing completed or under construction at the point in time that construction of a home on an owned lot begins. 
 In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment ASC 360 ), homebuilding inventories, excluding those classified as held for sale, are carried at cost unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the underlying subdivision may not be recoverable. We evaluate inventories for impairment at each quarter end on a subdivision level basis as each such subdivision represents the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. In making this determination, we review, among other things, the following for each subdivision: 
 actual and trending Operating Margin (which is defined as home sale revenues less home cost of sales and all incremental costs associated directly with the subdivision, including sales commissions and marketing costs); 
 forecasted Operating Margin for homes in backlog; 
 actual and trending net home orders; 
 homes available for sale; 
 market information for each sub-market, including competition levels, home foreclosure levels, the size and style of homes currently being offered for sale and lot size; and 
 known or probable events indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
 If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our inventory may not be recoverable, assets are reviewed for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from an individual subdivision (including capitalized interest) to its carrying value. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the subdivision s carrying value, the carrying value of the subdivision is written down to its then estimated fair value. We generally determine the estimated fair value of each subdivision by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows at discount rates, which are Level 3 inputs, that are commensurate with the risk of the subdivision under evaluation. The evaluation for the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets for each individual subdivision can be impacted significantly by our estimates of future home sale revenues, home construction costs, and development costs per home, all of which are Level 3 inputs.

 , with the exception of the lease governing the Company s headquarters. All of our property related leases are classified as operating leases. These leases do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants and do not include variable lease payments, except for the payment of common area maintenance and real estate taxes. Many of our property related leases give us the option to extend the lease term for a period of time, generally consistent with the initial lease term. These options are excluded from our calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability until such time as we determine it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. 
 The property related lease for the Company s headquarters in Denver, Colorado is in length with an expiration date of October 31, 2026 and contains a option to extend the term of the lease through 2036.

We record accruals for general and structural warranty claims, as well as accruals for known, unusual warranty-related expenditures. Our warranty accrual is recorded based upon historical payment experience in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. The determination of the warranty accrual rate for closed homes and the evaluation of our warranty accrual balance at period end are based on an internally developed analysis that includes known facts and interpretations of circumstances, including, among other things, our trends in historical warranty payment levels and warranty payments for claims not considered to be normal and recurring.

The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to deductible executive compensation, partially offset by non-deductible transaction costs and excise taxes as well as a tax reserve related to the Merger.

The estimated cost to complete obligations related to these bonds and letters of credit were approximately million and million, respectively. All letters of credit as of September 30, 2024, excluding those issued by HomeAmerican, were issued under our unsecured revolving credit facility (see Note 18 for further discussion of the revolving credit facility). We expect that the obligations secured by these performance bonds and letters of credit generally will be performed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. To the extent that the obligations are performed, the related performance bonds and letters of credit should be released and we should not have any continuing obligations. However, in the event any such performance bonds or letters of credit are called, our indemnity obligations could require us to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond or letter of credit. 
 We have made no material guarantees with respect to third-party obligations. 
 Litigation. Due to the nature of the homebuilding business, we have been named as defendants in various claims, complaints and other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including product liability claims and claims associated with the sale and financing of homes. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Lot Option Contracts . In the ordinary course of business, we enter into lot option purchase contracts Option Contracts ), generally through a deposit of cash or a letter of credit, for the right to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. The use of such land option and other contracts generally allow us to reduce the risks associated with direct land ownership and development, reduces our capital and financial commitments, and minimizes the amount of land inventories on our consolidated balance sheets. In certain cases, these contracts will be settled shortly following the end of the period. Our obligation with respect to Option Contracts is generally limited to forfeiture of the related deposits. At September 30, 2024, we had cash deposits, capitalized costs and letters of credit totaling million, million and million, respectively, at risk associated with options to purchase lots.

 Effective April 11, 2023, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to transition from a eurocurrency based interest rate to an interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). As defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, interest rates on base rate borrowings are equal to the highest of (1) , (2) a prime rate, (3) a federal funds effective rate plus , and (4) the one month term SOFR screen rate plus the SOFR adjustment plus and, in each case, plus a margin that is determined based on our credit ratings and leverage ratio. Interest rates on SOFR borrowings are equal to the greater of (1) and (2) the sum of the term SOFR screen rate for such interest period plus the SOFR adjustment, plus a margin that is determined based on our credit ratings and leverage ratio. At any time at which our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, exceeds , the aggregate principal amount of all consolidated senior debt borrowings outstanding may not exceed the borrowing base. There is no borrowing base requirement if our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, is or less. 
 Effective March 20, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to provide that the Merger (1) does not constitute a change in control triggering an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility and (2) does not constitute a prohibited merger under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. The facility contains various representations, warranties and covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The financial covenants include a consolidated tangible net worth test and a leverage test, along with a consolidated tangible net worth covenant, all as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. A failure to satisfy the foregoing tests does not constitute an event of default, but can trigger a term-out of the facility. A breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant (but not the consolidated tangible net worth test) or a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws would result in an event of default. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default, including breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant, a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws, failure to make timely payments, breaches of certain representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, or another person becoming beneficial owner of or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe we were in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 We incur costs associated with unused commitment fees pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were million and million, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the amounts available to be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately billion. 
 
 Mortgage Repurchase Facility. HomeAmerican entered into the Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement (the Mortgage Repurchase Facility with U.S. Bank National Association USBNA on September 20, 2024. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility amends and restates the prior agreement dated as of September 16, 2016, as amended. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility provides liquidity to HomeAmerican by providing for the sale of up to an aggregate of million (subject to increase by up to million under certain conditions) of eligible mortgage loans to USBNA with an agreement by HomeAmerican to repurchase the mortgage loans at a future date. Until such mortgage loans are transferred back to HomeAmerican, the documents relating to such loans are held by USBNA, as custodian, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Custody Agreement Custody Agreement ), dated as of September 20, 2024, by and between HomeAmerican and USBNA.

 Overview 
 Industry Conditions and Outlook for MDC 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the homebuilding industry remained stable as mortgage interest rates decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024. During 2024, the market for new homes has benefited from a healthy job market and the stabilization of interest rates, alongside Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which have given consumers the confidence to move forward with their home purchase decisions. Concurrently, the housing market continues to see inventory levels that remain undersupplied relative to demand due to (1) the underproduction of new homes over the past decade, and (2) the continuing low levels of existing home resale inventory as the majority of homeowners with a mortgage have an interest rate below 4 . 
 
 We continue executing on our strategic plan to build more quick move-in inventory in order to meet ongoing consumer preferences. We ended the quarter with 21.3 unsold homes under construction, excluding model homes, ("speculative homes" or "spec homes") per active community and just 4.5 completed spec homes per active community. Our timely pivot to building more spec homes has helped drive order volume, minimize cancellation activity and address the needs of first-time homebuyers. Further, the pivot helped drive a decrease in construction cycle times. 
 
 We believe that we are well equipped to navigate any continued market volatility given our seasoned leadership team, strong financial position and distinct operating strategy. We remain focused on maximizing risk-adjusted returns while minimizing the risks of excess leverage and land ownership. We ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 1.10 billion, total liquidity of 2.18 billion, a debt-to-capital ratio of 33.7 and no senior note maturities until 2030. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net income was 133.5 million, a 24 increase compared to net income of 107.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Our financial services business was the primary driver of the increase, as pretax income increased 15.5 million, or 125 year-over-year. The increase was further driven by a decrease to our overall effective income tax rate of 14.2 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.2 in the same period in the prior year. The homebuilding business was relatively flat year-over year, as pretax income increased 0.4 million to 127.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in financial services pretax income was due to our mortgage operations as well as our other financial services operations.The increase in pretax income for our mortgage operations was driven by increased volume due to our homebuilding operations and capture rate. This was partially offset by increased salary related expenses driven by higher headcount and commissions. The increase in other financial services operations was driven by our insurance operations, which saw an increase in revenue due to an increase in homes closed. Our financial services business saw an increase in interest income due to an increase in cash and short-term investments year-over-year. The decrease in our overall effective income tax rate was primarily due to executive compensation that is no longer limited under IRS Code Section 162(m). The slight increase in homebuilding pretax income was primarily due to a 28 increase in home sale revenues. This was offset by a decrease in gross margin from home sales and a decrease in interest income due to a lower average cash balance. The decrease in gross margin from home sales was driven largely by increased incentive levels. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income was 254.5 million, a 10 decrease compared to net income of 281.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Our homebuilding business was the primary driver of the decrease, as pretax income decreased 53.3 million, or 17 year-over-year. This was partially offset by our financial services business, as its pretax income increased 16.8 million, or 33 , compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in homebuilding pretax income was due to our Corporate segment, partially offset by our homebuilding business. The decrease in our Corporate segment was driven by a 220 basis point increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue. This increase was driven by the accelerated vesting of equity awards and key executives' transaction bonuses in connection with the closing of the Merger. Further contributing to the decrease was 38.6 million of transaction costs related to the Merger incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in our Corporate segment pretax income was partially offset by an increase in our homebuilding business pretax income driven by a 28 increase in home sale revenues and a 30 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales. The increase in gross margin from home sales was driven largely by inventory impairments of 27.5 million during the prior year compared to 16.8 million in the current year. The main drivers of the increase in financial services pretax income are consistent with the third quarter commentary discussed above.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded homebuilding pretax income of 127.8 million, which increased slightly compared to 127.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 28 increase in home sales revenue. This was offset by a decrease in gross margin from home sales and a decrease in interest income. 
 Our West segment experienced a 20.5 million year-over-year increase in pretax income, due to an increase in gross margin from home sales, a 23 increase in home sale revenues, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue. Our Mountain segment experienced a 2.2 million decrease in pretax income from the prior year, as a result of a decrease in gross margin from home sales, partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue and a 20 increase in home sale revenues. Our East segment experienced a 3.2 million decrease in pretax income from the prior year, due primarily to a decrease in gross margin from home sales, partially offset by a 60 increase in home sale revenues and a decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue. Our Corporate segment experienced a 14.8 million decrease in pretax income due to decreased interest income and an increase in cash bonus expense, which is mostly offset by decreased stock based compensation expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded homebuilding pretax income of 257.1 million, a decrease of 17 from 310.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was due to a 220 basis point increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sale revenues and 38.6 million of transaction costs related to the Merger. These decreases were partially offset by 28 increase in home sale revenues and a 30 basis point increase in gross margin from home sales. Commentary on the drivers of the increase in pretax income in our West homebuilding segment and decrease in the Mountain and East homebuilding segments is consistent with the 2024 third quarter discussion above. The decrease in the Corporate segment is due to the accelerated vesting of equity awards, key executives' transaction bonuses and transaction costs in connection with the closing of the Merger, decrease in interest income and bonus compensation that was historically paid in the form of equity awards that were instead paid in cash. This was partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expenses.

 Total homebuilding assets decreased 532.7 million, or 10 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily driven by our Corporate segment. The decrease in the Corporate segment was driven by an decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of funding 664.6 million of the aggregate consideration of the Merger. The decrease in the West Segment was driven by a decrease in land and land under development as well as housing completed or under construction. The increase in the

 New Home Deliveries Home Sale Revenues: 
 Changes in home sale revenues are impacted by changes in the number of new homes delivered and the average selling price of those delivered homes.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in the number of new homes delivered in each of our segments was primarily driven by an increase in the number of homes under construction (excluding models) to begin the period. Further, each segment saw an increase in monthly absorption rates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods. The West and Mountain segments saw decreased cycle times for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year, and each segments saw decreased cycle times for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average selling price of homes delivered during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased in our West segment as a result of a shift in mix to our California divisions from our Arizona divisions. The average selling price of homes delivered during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in our East segment decreased as a result of a change in mix to our more affordable product, a shift in mix to lower priced communities in our Florida markets. 
 
 Gross Margin from Home Sales: 
 Our gross margin from home sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 140 basis points year-over-year from 19.2 to 17.8 . The decrease in gross margin from home sales was driven by increased incentive levels and increased land costs, partially offset by decreased indirect construction costs due to a decrease in cycle times. 
 Our gross margin from home sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 30 basis points year-over-year from 17.5 to 17.8 . The increase in gross margin from home sales was driven largely by 16.8 million of inventory impairments recognized during the current year period compared to 27.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was also driven by decreased indirect construction costs due to a decrease in cycle times, partially offset by increased land costs.

 General and administrative expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by the increased salary related expenses due to increased headcount and increased cash bonus expense, which is mostly offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 increase was further due to the vesting of equity awards and key executives' transaction bonuses in connection with the closing of the Merger as well as bonus compensation that was historically paid in the form of equity awards that were instead paid in cash. 
 Marketing expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by increased deferred selling amortization and master marketing expenses due to an increase in home closings year over year. 
 Commissions expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increases in home sale revenues and an increase in external broker commissions driven by higher participation.

 West Segment Commentary 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in the number of net new orders was driven by a decrease in average active subdivisions, offset partially by an increase in the monthly sales absorption rate due to an increase in spec home inventory and a decrease in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in the number of net new orders was driven by an increase in the monthly sales absorption rate due to an increase in spec home inventory and a decrease in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales, offset partially by a decrease in average active subdivisions. The increased cancellations experienced during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of the sharp rise in mortgage interest rates and homebuyer concerns about purchasing in an uncertain housing market.

 Mountain Segment Commentary 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in the number of net new orders was driven by an increase in the monthly sales absorption rate due to an increase in spec home inventory and a decrease in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales, offset partially by a decrease in average active subdivisions. The increased cancellations experienced during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of the sharp rise in mortgage interest rates and homebuyer concerns about purchasing in an uncertain housing market. 
 East Segment Commentary 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in the number of net new orders was driven by an increase in the monthly sales absorption rate due to an increase in spec home inventory and a decrease in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales. Further, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 an increase in average active subdivisions. The increased cancellations experienced during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of the sharp rise in mortgage interest rates and homebuyer concerns about purchasing in an uncertain housing market. The decrease in the average selling price in our East segment was due to change in mix to more affordable product in our Florida markets.

 In light of our pivot to build more spec homes, we believe it is appropriate to view our cancellations as a product of both our beginning backlog as well as our gross sales during the period. Our cancellation rate as a percentage of homes in beginning backlog increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to a decrease in beginning backlog to start the period, partially offset by a decrease in cancellations in our West and Mountain segments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Further, our cancellation rate as a percentage of gross sales decreased year-over-year during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of improved demand as well as the impact the increase in mortgage interest rates in the prior year period had on our homebuyers in backlog who where unable to lock their interest rate prior to these increases.

 At September 30, 2024, we had 1,065 homes in backlog with a total value of 628.5 million. This represented a 62 decrease in the number of homes in backlog and a 62 decrease in the dollar value of those homes in backlog from September 30, 2023. The decrease in the number of homes in backlog was primarily a result of a shift in consumer preference to quick move-in homes and our associated pivot to build more spec homes. The increase in average selling price in the West segment was driven by a change in mix from our Arizona communities to our California communities. The decrease in average selling price in our East segment was driven by a change in mix to our more affordable product.

 Our total owned and optioned lots at September 30, 2024 were 23,979, which represented a 7 increase year-over-year. We believe that our total lot supply is sufficient to meet our operating needs, consistent with our philosophy of maintaining a two to three year supply of land.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our financial services pretax income increased to 27.9 million compared to 12.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financial services pretax income increased to 68.2 million compared to 51.4 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in financial services pretax income was driven by both our mortgage operations and other financial services segments. The increase in mortgage operations was driven by increased volume due to our homebuilding operations and capture rate. This was partially offset by increased salary related expenses driven by higher headcount and commissions. The increase in other financial services was driven by our insurance operations which saw an increase in revenue due to an increase in homes closed.

 Income Taxes 
 As a result of the Merger described in Footnote 4, and effective April 20, 2024, the Company is included in the Sekisui House US Holdings ("SHUSH") (parent of SH Residential Holdings, LLC) consolidated tax group for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although the Company s post-merger results are included in the SHUSH consolidated return, our income tax provision is calculated primarily as though we were a separate taxpayer for the full year. However, under certain circumstances, transactions between the Company and SHUSH are assessed using consolidated tax return rules and any difference in liability between the separate company method will be addressed in a future tax sharing arrangement. 
 
 Our overall effective income tax rates were 14.2 and 21.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 23.2 and 22.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in an income tax expense of 22.1 million and 70.8 million, respectively, compared to 32.5 million and 80.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to deductible executive compensation, partially offset by non-deductible transaction costs and excise taxes as well as a tax reserve related to the Merger.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates such estimates and judgments on an on-going basis and makes adjustments as deemed necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates if conditions are significantly different in the future. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below. 
 Our critical accounting estimates and policies have not changed from those reported in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We use our liquidity and capital resources to (1) support our operations, including the purchase of land, land development and construction of homes; (2) provide working capital; and (3) provide mortgage loans for our homebuyers. Our liquidity includes our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and Mortgage Repurchase Facility (as defined below). 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, payments due on our Mortgage Repurchase Facility, purchase obligations related to expected acquisition of land under purchase agreements and land development agreements (many of which are secured by letters of credit or surety bonds) and operating leases. Other material cash requirements include land acquisition and development costs not yet contracted for, home construction costs, operating expenses, including our selling, general and administrative expenses, investments and funding of capital improvements and dividend payments. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding senior notes with varying maturities totaling an aggregate principal amount of 1.50 billion, with none payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the notes total 1.19 billion, with 64.2 million payable within 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, we had 20.4 million of required operating lease future minimum payments. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had deposits of 49.7 million in the form of cash and 14.6 million in the form of letters of credit that secured option contracts to purchase 6,104 lots for a total estimated purchase price of 856.7 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit totaling 317.0 million and 184.1 million, respectively, including 147.8 million in letters of credit issued by HomeAmerican. The estimated cost to complete obligations related to these bonds and letters of credit was approximately 120.4 million and 136.0 million, respectively. We expect that the obligations secured by these performance bonds and letters of credit generally will be performed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. To the extent that the obligations are performed, the related performance bonds and letters of credit should be released and we should not have any continuing obligations. However, in the event any such performance bonds or letters of credit are called, our indemnity obligations could require us to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond or letter of credit. We have made no material guarantees with respect to third-party obligations. 
 Capital Resources 
 Our capital structure is primarily a combination of (1) permanent financing, represented by stockholders equity; (2) long-term financing, represented by our 3.850 senior notes due 2030, 2.500 senior notes due 2031, 6.000 senior notes due 2043, and 3.966 senior notes due 2061; (3) our Revolving Credit Facility; and (4) our Mortgage Repurchase Facility. Because of our current balance of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, ability to access the capital markets, and available capacity under both our Revolving Credit Facility and Mortgage Repurchase Facility, we believe that our capital resources are adequate to 
 -38- 

Table of Contents 

 satisfy our short and long-term capital requirements, including meeting future payments on our senior notes as they become due. See Forward-Looking Statements below. 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes through cash purchases, whether through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Senior Notes, Revolving Credit Facility and Mortgage Repurchase Facility 
 Senior Notes. Our senior notes are not secured and, while the senior note indentures contain some restrictions on secured debt and other transactions, they do not contain financial covenants. Our senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. We believe that we are in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants in the senior note indentures. 
 Revolving Credit Facility. We have an unsecured revolving credit agreement Revolving Credit Facility with a group of lenders, which may be used for general corporate purposes. This agreement was amended on December 28, 2020 to (1) increase the aggregate commitment from 1.0 billion to 1.2 billion (the "Commitment"), (2) extend the Revolving Credit Facility maturity of 1.125 billion of the Commitments to December 18, 2025 with the remaining Commitment terminated on December 18, 2023 and (3) provide that the aggregate amount of the commitments may increase to an amount not to exceed 1.7 billion upon our request, subject to receipt of additional commitments from existing or additional lenders and, in the case of additional lenders, the consent of the co-administrative agents. 
 Effective April 11, 2023, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to transition from a eurocurrency based interest rate to an interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). As defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, interest rates on base rate borrowings are equal to the highest of (1) 0.0 , (2) a prime rate, (3) a federal funds effective rate plus 0.50 , and (4) the one month term SOFR screen rate plus the SOFR adjustment plus 1.00 and, in each case, plus a margin that is determined based on our credit ratings and leverage ratio. Interest rates on SOFR borrowings are equal to the greater of (1) 0.0 and (2) the sum of the term SOFR screen rate for such interest period plus the SOFR adjustment, plus a margin that is determined based on our credit ratings and leverage ratio. At any time at which our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, exceeds 55 , the aggregate principal amount of all consolidated senior debt borrowings outstanding may not exceed the borrowing base. There is no borrowing base requirement if our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, is 55 or less. 
 Effective March 20, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to provide that the Merger (1) does not constitute a change in control triggering an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility and (2) does not constitute a prohibited merger under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. The facility contains various representations, warranties and covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The financial covenants include a consolidated tangible net worth test and a leverage test, along with a consolidated tangible net worth covenant, all as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. A failure to satisfy the foregoing tests does not constitute an event of default, but can trigger a term-out of the facility. A breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant (but not the consolidated tangible net worth test) or a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws would result in an event of default. 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default, including breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant, a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws, failure to make timely payments, breaches of certain representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, or another person becoming beneficial owner of 50 or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe we were in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 We incur costs associated with unused commitment fees pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 36.3 million and 40.8 million, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the amounts available to be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1.0 million and 10.0 million, respectively, outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately 1.09 billion.

 Mortgage Repurchase Facility. HomeAmerican entered into the Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement (the Mortgage Repurchase Facility with U.S. Bank National Association USBNA on September 20, 2024. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility amends and restates the prior agreement dated as of September 16, 2016, as amended. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility provides liquidity to HomeAmerican by providing for the sale of up to an aggregate of 150 million (subject to increase by up to 150 million under certain conditions) of eligible mortgage loans to USBNA with an agreement by HomeAmerican to repurchase the mortgage loans at a future date. Until such mortgage loans are transferred back to HomeAmerican, the documents relating to such loans are held by USBNA, as custodian, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Custody Agreement Custody Agreement ), dated as of September 20, 2024, by and between HomeAmerican and USBNA. In the event that an eligible mortgage loan becomes ineligible, as defined under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility, HomeAmerican may be required to repurchase the ineligible mortgage loan immediately. The total capacity of the facility at September 30, 2024 was 175 million. The termination date of the Mortgage Repurchase Facility is August 8, 2025. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, HomeAmerican had 171.2 million and 205.0 million, respectively, of mortgage loans that HomeAmerican was obligated to repurchase under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility. Mortgage loans that HomeAmerican is obligated to repurchase under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility are accounted for as a debt financing arrangement and are reported as mortgage repurchase facility in the consolidated balance sheets. Pricing under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility is based on SOFR. 
 The Mortgage Repurchase Facility contains various representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include, among others, (i) a minimum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth requirement, (ii) a maximum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth ratio, (iii) a minimum adjusted net income requirement, and (iv) a minimum Liquidity requirement. The foregoing capitalized terms are defined in the Mortgage Repurchase Facility. We believe HomeAmerican was in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Mortgage Repurchase Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 Effective March 5, 2024, HomeAmerican entered into a Waiver and Consent agreement with USBNA, in which USBNA as agent waived any events of default under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility arising with respect to the change of control occurring as a result of the Merger. USBNA also consented and agreed to the consummation of the Merger as well as any reconstitution of the Company's board of directors that might result from the Merger. 
 The Merger would have triggered a change in control event of default under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility, and the Company obtained lender s consent to the Merger obviating a default.

 Consolidated Cash Flow 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 139.1 million compared with 623.1 million in the prior year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one of the most significant sources of cash provided by operating activities was net income of 254.5 million and 281.5 million, respectively. Another significant source of cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was cash provided by the decrease in land and land under development of 52.9 million and 456.4 million, respectively. The decrease in 2024 and 2023 was the result of home starts outnumbering lot acquisitions during the respective periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used by housing completed or under construction was 158.9 million and 202.9 million, respectively. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by an increase in the number of homes under construction during the period. Cash used by the increase in trade and other receivables for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.1 million compared to cash provided by the decrease in trade and other receivables of 45.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a increase of homes closed at the end of the period as well as an increase in taxes receivable as a result of benefits associated with deductible executive compensation. Cash used in accounts receivable due from Parent was 22.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by payments in connection with the Merger funded by the Company. There was no cash used in accounts receivable due from Parent in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 19.2 million and 55.5 million, respectively. The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to decreased accrued compensation as a result of payments made in connection with the closing of the Merger as well as decreased escrow deposits. Cash used to increase mortgage loans held-for-sale was 27.5 million compared to cash provided by the decrease in mortgage loans held-for-sale of 65.3 million in the nine months ended September 30 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in mortgage loans held-for-sale was a result of a increase in loan originations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 19.0 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 145.7 million in the same period in the prior year. The primary driver of this decrease is the increase of net reinvestment into marketable securities from marketable security maturities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 762.3 million and 123.6 million respectively. The primary driver of this increase in net cash used in financing activities was the increase in distribution to Parent of 611.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the Company's funding of a portion of the consideration of the Merger. Cash used to fund dividend payments decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to no dividend being paid in the second quarter of 2024, slightly offset by an increase in the dividend per share during the first quarter of 2024 to 0.55 from 0.50. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in the payments on mortgage repurchase facility, net was 33.8 million compared to 30.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 there was a higher level of originations compared to loan sales at period end. Cash used in issuance of shares under stock-based compensation programs, net was 25.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by issuances of shares under stock-based compensation programs, net of 20.8 million during the same period in the prior year. The change was resulting from a decrease in cash received from the exercise of stock options driven by a decrease in the number of stock options exercised year-over-year.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as statements made by us in periodic press releases, oral statements made by our officials in the course of presentations about the Company and conference calls in connection with quarterly earnings releases, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. These forward-looking statements may be identified by terminology such as likely, may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, "opinion," estimates, predicts, potential or continue, or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Report are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K should be considered. Additionally, information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance and risk factors that have the potential to affect us are contained under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We have a cash and investment policy that enables us to achieve an appropriate investment return while preserving principal and managing risk. Under this policy, cash and cash equivalents may include U.S. government securities, commercial bank deposits, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and money market funds, and time deposits, with maturities of three months or less. Marketable securities under this policy may include holdings in U.S. government securities with a maturity of more than three months, equity securities and corporate debt securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents included commercial bank deposits and money market funds and our marketable securities included U.S. government treasury securities with original maturities upon acquisition of less than six months. 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on mortgage loans held-for-sale, mortgage interest rate lock commitments, marketable securities and debt. Financial instruments utilized in the normal course of business by HomeAmerican include forward sales of mortgage-backed securities, which are commitments to sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price, mandatory delivery forward loan sale commitments, which are obligations of an investor to buy loans at a specified price within a specified time period, and best-effort delivery forward loan sale commitments, which are obligations of an investor to buy loans at a specified price subject to the underlying mortgage loans being funded and closed. Such contracts are the only significant financial and derivative instruments utilized by MDC. HomeAmerican s mortgage loans in process for which an interest rate lock commitment had been made to a borrower that had not closed at September 30, 2024 had an aggregate principal balance of 275.3 million, of which 274.4 million had not yet been committed to a mortgage purchaser. In addition, HomeAmerican had mortgage loans held-for-sale with an aggregate principal balance of 233.0 million at September 30, 2024, of which 190.3 million had not yet been committed to a mortgage purchaser. In order to hedge the changes in fair value of interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held-for-sale that had not yet been committed to a mortgage purchaser, HomeAmerican had forward sales of securities totaling 419.5 million and 311.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 HomeAmerican provides mortgage loans that generally are sold forward on a best-efforts or mandatory commitment basis and subsequently delivered to a third-party purchaser between 5 and 35 days after closing. Forward sale commitments and forward sales of mortgage-backed securities are used for non-trading purposes to sell mortgage loans and economically hedge price risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on rate-locked mortgage loans in process that have not closed and mortgage loans held-for-sale. Due to this economic hedging philosophy, the market risk associated with these mortgages is limited. For forward sales commitments, forward sales of mortgage-backed securities and commitments to originate mortgage loans that are still outstanding at the end of a reporting period, we record the changes in fair value of these financial instruments in revenues in the financial services section of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income with an offset to either other assets or accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the financial services section of our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the nature of the change. 
 We utilize our Revolving Credit Facility, our Mortgage Repurchase Facility and senior notes in our financing strategy. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but do not affect our earnings or cash flows. We do not have an obligation to prepay our senior notes prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value do not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For variable rate debt such as our Revolving Credit Facility and Mortgage Repurchase Facility, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the outstanding borrowing on the debt facilities, but do affect our earnings and cash flows. See Forward-Looking Statements above. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures - An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including the Executive Chairman (principal executive officer) and the Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting - There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement is intended to be interpreted and applied so that the payment of the benefits set forth herein will either be exempt from, or in the alternative, comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A. A termination of employment will not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment that are considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a termination, Termination Date or like terms will mean separation from service. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A on the date of his separation from service, any payments or arrangements due upon a termination of Executive s employment under any arrangement that constitutes a nonqualified deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A and which do not otherwise qualify under the exemptions under Treas. Regs. Section 1.409A-1 (including without limitation, the short-term deferral exemption or the permitted payments under Treas. Regs. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)), will be delayed and paid or provided on the earlier of (i) the date which is six months after Executive s separation from service for any reason other than death or presumed death, or (ii) the date of Executive s death or presumed death. 
 (c) After his Termination Date, Executive will have no duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent with having a separation from service within the meaning 
 7 

of Section 409A as of the Termination Date and, notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, distributions upon termination of employment of nonqualified deferred compensation may only be made upon a separation from service as determined under Section 409A and such date will be the Termination Date for purposes of this Agreement. Each payment under this Agreement or otherwise will be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement which constitutes a nonqualified deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A and to the extent an amount is payable within a time period, the time during which such amount is paid will be in the discretion of the Company. 
 (d) All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement will be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. To the extent that any reimbursements are taxable to Executive, such reimbursements will be paid to Executive on or before the last day of Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which the related expense was incurred. Reimbursements will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit and the amount of such reimbursements that Executive receives in one taxable year will not affect the amount of such reimbursements that Executive receives in any other taxable year. 
 (e) This Section 5(e) shall be construed in accordance with Code Sections 280G and 4999, or any successor provisions thereto, and the guidance issued thereunder (collectively, Section 280G ), and the terms parachute payment and excess parachute payment as used herein have the meanings ascribed to them under Section 280G. 
 (i) If it shall be determined that the aggregate payments and benefits constituting parachute payments which, but for the operation of this provision, would become payable or distributable by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, pursuant to this Agreement, any other agreement, or any benefit plan (collectively, the Total Payments ), would result in any excess parachute payments becoming subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, or any successor provision thereto, or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with such interest and penalties, collectively, the Excise Tax ), then the Total Payments shall be reduced to an amount equal to one dollar less than the amount which would cause the parachute payments to be subject to the Excise Tax provided that the reduction contemplated by this Section 5(e) shall be applied only if the net after-tax benefit to Executive after such reduction would be greater than the net after-tax benefit to Executive without such reduction (notwithstanding the application of any Excise Tax on the unreduced Total Payments). For the avoidance of doubt, Executive shall be responsible for the payment of any Excise Tax arising from the Total Payments. 
 (ii) The Company will reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating any cash parachute payments that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then by reducing or eliminating any other parachute payments that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then by reducing or eliminating all other parachute payments that do constitute deferred 
 8 

compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, beginning with those payments last to be paid, subject to and in accordance with all applicable requirements of Section 409A. 
 (iii) Unless the Company and Executive otherwise agree in writing, all calculations and determinations necessary to effectuate this provision, including without limitation determinations as to whether a reduction in payments or benefits is required and the amount thereof, whether any item of compensation constitutes a parachute payment, the amount, if any, subject to the Excise Tax (including determinations as to whether any portion of the excess parachute payments constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(4)(B)), and the present value of any parachute payment, shall be made, consistent with Section 280G, by Ernst & Young LLP (the Advisors ). For this purpose, the Advisors may make reasonable assumptions and approximations may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Section 280G and may rely upon such other tax, legal, valuation or other specialists as they deem appropriate. Executive s applicable federal, state, and local income taxes shall be computed at the highest applicable marginal rate, net of the maximum reduction, if any, in federal income taxes which could be obtained from a deduction of such state and local taxes. The Company and Executive agree to furnish the Advisors with such information and documents as the Advisors reasonably request to make such calculations and determinations as soon as practicable upon such request. The Company shall direct the Advisors to provide Executive with a written statement of its conclusions, setting forth the basis therefor, including detailed supporting calculations and copies of any written opinions or advice upon which such conclusions rely (the Report ), within ten business days after their receipt of all required information and documents. Executive shall have five business days thereafter to notify the Advisors and the Company in writing of any reasonable and substantive objections to the Report. The Company shall direct the Advisors to promptly consider in good faith and respond to such objections and provide Executive a revised Report reflecting appropriate adjustments (unless the Advisors determine that no adjustments are necessary). The Advisors final calculations and determinations (as adjusted, if applicable) shall be conclusive and binding on all parties for all purposes. The Company shall bear all costs the Advisors may reasonably incur in connection with the process contemplated by this Section 5(e). 
 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5, Executive will be responsible for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on him in connection with any payments made pursuant to this Agreement, and neither Parent, the Company nor any of their respective affiliates or successors shall have any obligation to reimburse, indemnify or otherwise hold Executive harmless from any or all such taxes or penalties, unless the taxes and or penalties that are imposed on Executive are a result of the Company failing to properly collect, account for, deposit and report taxes in accordance with Section 5(a), in which case the Company has an obligation to reimburse, indemnify and otherwise hold Executive harmless from any or all such taxes or penalties. 
 6. Covenants . 
 (a) Confidentiality . Executive agrees that, during the Employment Term and for a period of twelve months beginning on the last day of the Employment Term, he will not 
 9 

divulge, furnish or make accessible to any person, corporation, partnership, trust or other organization or entity (other than Executive s legal, tax and other advisors, to the extent they need to know such confidential information to advise Executive), any information, trade secrets, technical data or know-how relating to the business, business practices, methods, attorney-client communications, pending or contemplated acquisitions or other transactions, products, processes, equipment or any confidential or secret aspect of the business of the Company without the prior written consent of the Company, unless such information has become public knowledge or has become known generally to competitors of the Company through sources other than Executive. This prohibition does not apply to information which arises from Executive s general training, knowledge, skill, or experience, whether gained on the job, or otherwise is readily ascertainable or generally known to the public or Executive otherwise has a right to disclose pursuant to legally protected conduct. 
 (b) Non-Solicitation . 
 i. Beginning on the date hereof and for a period of twelve months beginning on (1) the last day of the Employment Term or (2) a termination of Executive s employment by the Company for Cause (the Non-Solicit Period ), Executive will not, and will cause his affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, through or in association with any third party (x) solicit any customer, supplier, distributor, developer, service provider, licensor, or licensee or other material business relation of the Company, or (y) attempt to do any of the foregoing, either for Executive s own purposes or for any other third party. 
 ii. During the Non-Solicit Period, Executive will not, and will cause his or her affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, through or in association with any third party (1) solicit, induce, recruit, or encourage any employees or independent contractors of or consultants to the Company to terminate their relationship with the Company or (2) attempt to do any of the foregoing, either for Executive s own purposes or for any other third party. 
 (c) Remedy for Breach . Executive acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 6 are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company s trade secrets and that the Company will be irrevocably damaged if such covenants are not specifically enforced. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, in addition to any other relief to which the Company may be entitled, the Company (or an applicable affiliate thereof) will be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of restraining Executive from any actual breach of such covenants without the requirement of posting a bond. If Executive violates any of the terms of the restrictive covenant obligations in this Agreement, such restrictions will automatically be extended by the period Executive was in violation of them. 
 (d) Non-Disparagement . Executive hereby agrees that Executive will not, at any time, make any statement intended to disparage, defame or otherwise malign the goodwill or reputation of Parent, the Company or any of their respective stakeholders, officers or directors. The Parent and the Company hereby also agree that it will instruct its respective officers, 
 10 

employees and directors to not, at any time, make any statement intended to disparage, defame or otherwise malign the goodwill or reputation of Executive. 
 (e) Protected Activity . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Executive will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for any disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (2) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (B) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. If Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Executive may disclose the Company s trade secrets to Executive s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if Executive files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive (or Executive s attorneys) from initiating communications directly with, or responding to any inquiry from, or providing testimony before, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), any other self-regulatory organization or any other state or federal regulatory authority regarding this Agreement or its underlying facts or circumstances. In addition, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal, state, or local law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the SEC, FINRA, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state, or local law or regulation. Executive is not required to contact the Company regarding the subject matter of any such communications before engaging in such communications. Further, nothing in this Agreement limits Executive s ability to disclose or discuss, either orally or in writing, any alleged discriminatory or unfair employment practice, as set forth in C.R.S. 24-34-402.
