 Interest is capitalized to real estate inventory during development and other qualifying activities. During all periods presented, we capitalized all interest incurred to real estate inventory in accordance with ASC Topic 835, Interest, as our qualified assets exceeded our debt. Interest that is capitalized to real estate inventory is included in cost of home sales or cost of land and lot sales as related units or lots are delivered. Interest that is expensed as incurred is included in other (expense) income, net. 
 Real Estate Inventory Impairments and Land Option Abandonments

 Impairments of real estate inventory relate primarily to projects or communities that include homes completed or under construction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a real estate inventory impairment charge of million related to active community in the West segment where the carrying value of the community exceeded the fair value based on a discounted cash flows analysis. The discount rate used to calculate fair value was . We considered both market risk and community-specific risk to arrive at a discount rate appropriate for the level of total risk associated with this community. 
 In addition to owning land and residential lots, we also have option agreements to purchase land and lots at a future date. We have option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs associated with the optioned land and lots. When the economics of a project no longer support acquisition of the land or lots under option, we may elect not to move forward with the acquisition. Option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs associated with the assets under option may be forfeited at that time. 
 Real estate inventory impairments and land option abandonments are recorded in cost of home sales in the consolidated statements of operations.

 Guarantees 
 The unconsolidated entities in which we hold an equity investment generally finance their activities with a combination of equity and secured project debt financing. We have, and in some cases our joint venture partner has, guaranteed portions of the loan obligations for some of the homebuilding partnerships or limited liability companies, which may include any or all of the following: (i) project completion; (ii) remargin obligations; and (iii) environmental indemnities. 
 In circumstances in which we have entered into joint and several guarantees with our joint venture partner, we generally seek to implement a reimbursement agreement with our partner that provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share or agreed-upon share of the guaranteed obligations. In the event our joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under such a reimbursement agreement, or otherwise fails to satisfy its obligations thereunder, we may be responsible for more than our proportionate share of any obligations under such guarantees. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have not recorded any liabilities for these obligations and guarantees, as the fair value of the related joint venture real estate assets exceeded the threshold where a remargin payment would be required and no other obligations under the guarantees existed as of such time. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, aggregate outstanding debt for unconsolidated entities, included in the Debt obligations and other liabilities line of the aggregated assets, liabilities and equity shown in the table above, was million and million, respectively.

 legal reserves as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Warranty 
 Warranty reserves are accrued as home deliveries occur. Our warranty reserves on homes delivered will vary based on product type and geographic area and also depending on state and local laws. The warranty reserve is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and represents expected future costs based on our historical experience over previous years. Estimated warranty costs are charged to cost of home sales in the period in which the related home sales revenue is recognized. 
 We maintain general liability insurance designed to protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from warranty and construction defect-related claims. We also generally require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for liabilities arising from their work, subject to various limitations. However, such indemnity is significantly limited with respect to certain subcontractors that are added to our general liability insurance policy. 
 Our warranty reserve and related estimated insurance recoveries are based on actuarial analysis that uses our historical claim and expense data, as well as industry data to estimate these overall costs and related recoveries. Key assumptions used in developing these estimates include claim frequencies, severities and resolution patterns, which can occur over an extended period of time. Our warranty reserve may also include an estimate of future fit and finish warranty claims to the extent not contemplated in the actuarial analysis. These estimates are subject to variability due to the length of time between the delivery of a home to a homebuyer and when a warranty or construction defect claim is made, and the ultimate resolution of such claim;

 Per formance Bonds 
 We obtain surety bonds in the normal course of business to ensure completion of certain infrastructure improvements of our projects. The beneficiaries of the bonds are various municipalities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding surety bonds totaling million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our estimated cost to complete obligations related to these surety bonds was million and million, respectively. 
 Lease Obligations 
 Under ASC 842 we recognize a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability for contracts deemed to contain a lease at the inception of the contract. Our lease population is fully comprised of operating leases, which are now recorded at the net present value of future lease obligations existing at each balance sheet date. At the inception of a lease, or if a lease is subsequently modified, we determine whether the lease is an operating or financing lease. Key estimates involved with ASC 842 include the discount rate used to measure our future lease obligations and the lease term, where considerations include renewal options and intent to renew. Lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 Operating Leases 
 We lease certain property and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Office leases are for terms of up to and generally provide renewal options. In most cases, we expect that, in the normal course of business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Equipment leases are typically for terms of three to .

 In 1987, we obtained -year ground leases of commercial property that provided for renewal options of each and -year renewal option. We exercised the extensions on of these ground leases to extend the lease through 2071.

 Summary of Stock Option Activity 
 Granted Exercised ) Forfeited Options outstanding at September 30, 2024 Options exercisable at September 30, 2024 
 
 The intrinsic value of each stock option award outstanding or exercisable is the difference between the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the end of the period and the exercise price of each stock option award to the extent it is considered in-the-money . A stock option award is considered to be in-the-money if the fair market value of the Company s stock is greater than the exercise price of the stock option award. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable represents the value that would have been received by the holders of stock option awards had they exercised their stock option award on the last trading day of the period and sold the underlying shares at the closing price on that day.

The Company will continue to evaluate both positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Changes in positive and negative evidence, including differences between the Company s future operating results and the estimates utilized in the determination of the valuation allowance, could result in changes in the Company s estimate of the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial position.

 Overview and Outlook 
 Market fundamentals, including a growing cohort of Millennial and Gen Z buyers and a structural incongruity between housing supply and demand, continue to support sustained growth in the housing sector. Notwithstanding, fluctuations driven by elevated mortgage rates, seasonality, and political and geopolitical factors tempered demand in the third quarter. In September, the FOMC implemented a 50-basis-point rate cut, signaling a shift toward a more accommodative monetary polic y in the near term . While the FOMC rate does not directly determine mortgage rates, its easing decision likely will contribute to a downward trend in borrowing costs over time , potentially improving housing affordability and/or unlocking both buyer demand and seller activity. As mortgage rates have remained elevated, however, we continue to employ mortgage rate buydowns and strategic pricing adjustments to maintain sales momentum. Such incentives remain a crucial tool in addressing affordability challenges posed by higher mortgage rates and the rapid price appreciation that occurred during and subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking ahead, our increased focus on speculative builds further supports these strategies, allowing us to meet the growing demand for quicker move-ins while enhancing operational efficiency. 
 The third quarter demonstrated strong financial performance across all reporting segments. We achieved a 32 increase in new home deliveries, reaching 1,619. This drove a 35 increase in home sales revenue to 1.1 billion. Enhanced pricing and cost management, along with broader operational improvements, led to a 23.3 homebuilding gross margin, representing a 100-basis-point improvement compared to the prior-year period. We also realized greater operating leverage, decreasing our sales and marketing and general and administrative SG A expense as a percentage of home sales revenue to 10.8 . Ultimately, net income available to common stockholders rose 48 to 111.8 million, and diluted earnings per share rose 55 to 1.18. These results reflect the strong order demand we experienced throughout the first half of the year, coupled with our commitment to cost control and efficiency. 
 Net new home orders for the quarter were 1,252, on a monthly absorption rate of 2.8 orders per average selling community. Our backlog units and dollar value ended the quarter at 2,325 and 1.7 billion, respectively, positioning us well for a strong fourth quarter. Our increased spec strategy has allowed us to accelerate backlog turnover, and as we continue to execute on this approach, we anticipate some moderation in backlog levels. However, a faster conversion of units into deliveries enhances operational efficiency and supports sustained growth moving forward. Additionally, with a homebuilding debt-to-capital ratio of 22.1 and a net homebuilding debt-to-net capital of 7.0 , our strong balance sheet continues to provide the financial flexibility needed to support our growth initiatives.

 Net new home orders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 261, or 17 , to 1,252, compared to 1,513 during the prior-year period. The decrease in net new home orders was due to a 15 decrease in monthly absorption rates and a 3 decrease in average selling communities. While order demand followed typical seasonal patterns, it was slightly slower than usual, which we attribute to a combination of elevated mortgage rates, election-related uncertainty, and the usual seasonal slowdown. These factors contributed to a more cautious buyer environment during the quarter. 
 Our West segment reported a 19 decrease in net new home orders due to an 11 decrease in monthly absorption rates and a 9 decrease in average selling communities. Despite declines in monthly absorption rates in a majority of our West

markets, our monthly absorption rate of 3.1 remains strong and above the Company s combined rate of 2.8. Our most challenged West markets were Sacramento and the Bay Area of California, where we achieved monthly absorption rates of 2.3 and 2.2, respectively. Our 9 decrease in average selling communities was due largely to activity in our Orange County-Los Angeles market, where our average community count has dropped by 45 as we continue to experience strong demand and successfully sell through communities at a pace that exceeds our current capacity for community openings. During the current quarter, we opened 9 new communities and closed out 14 communities in our West segment. Our Central segment reported an 18 decrease in net new home orders due to a 21 decrease in monthly absorption rates, offset by a 4 increase in average selling communities. Each of our Central markets experienced a decrease in monthly absorption rates, with the largest impact coming from our Colorado market, where we continue to experience weakened buyer interest and increased competitive pressures. Our East segment reported a 6 decrease in net new home orders due to a 6 decrease in monthly absorption rate. Despite this slowdown, we remain optimistic, as all of our markets in the East segment achieved a monthly absorption rate of 3.4 or higher for the quarter.

 Backlog units reflect the number of homes, net of actual cancellations experienced during the period, for which we have entered into a sales contract with a homebuyer but for which we have not yet delivered the home. Homes in backlog are generally delivered within seven to ten months from the time the sales contract is entered into, although we may experience cancellations of sales contracts prior to delivery. Our cancellation rate of homebuyers who contracted to buy a home but cancelled prior to delivery of the home (as a percentage of overall orders) was 10 during each three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The dollar value of backlog was 1.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 billion as of September 30, 2023. The average sales price in backlog increased 8 to 745,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 693,000 at September 30, 2023. This increase in average sales price can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the broad housing price resiliency, as evidenced by recent housing data indicating national home prices are at or near all-time high levels. 
 Backlog dollar value in our West segment decreased 23 due to a 27 decrease in backlog units, offset by a 5 increase in average sales price. The decrease in backlog units was largely due to a 10 decrease in net new home orders for the current year-to-date period, as demand during the current-year has moderated to a more normal level, compared to a slightly more robust prior-year period. The decrease in backlog units was further impacted by our 26 increase in deliveries over this same period, as we continue to execute our spec strategy, leading to more efficient backlog conversion. In our Central segment, backlog dollar value decreased by 16 , driven by a 17 decline in backlog units, partially offset by a 1 increase in average sales price. This reduction in backlog units was largely due to flat order activity year-to-date, coupled with a significant increase in deliveries as we executed our spec strategy and improved backlog conversion. In the East segment, backlog dollar value increased by 1 , driven by a 37 rise in average sales price, offset by a 26 decline in backlog units. Net new home orders in the East segment fell by 9 during the current nine-month period, and higher backlog conversion rates contributed to the reduction in backlog units. A 25 increase in home deliveries during the same period, along with strong backlog conversion, further lowered backlog units. The 235,000 increase in average sales price within the backlog was primarily due to growth in our Charlotte market and a higher proportion of units in the DC Metro market, where prices significantly exceed both segment and company averages.

 Home sales revenue increased 288.4 million to 1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior-year period. The increase was comprised of 267.3 million related to a 396-unit increase in new homes delivered in the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a 21.0 million decrease related to a 13,000 increase in average sales price for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We experienced significantly stronger order demand in the second half of 2023 compared to 2022, which helped propel our backlog units and dollar value by 58 and 38 , respectively, heading into the current-year period compared to the prior-year period. This increased backlog elevated our delivery potential in the current-year period, and our seasonally strong backlog conversion ratio of 60 helped drive our delivery and home sales revenue growth. Our strategy to increase specs further supported this strong conversion rate, enabling us to capture more deliveries and contribute to overall growth. 
 Home sales revenue in our West segment increased 26 due to a 24 increase in new homes delivered and a 2 increase in average sales price during the current-year period. The rise in deliveries reflects a higher backlog at the start of the current-year period compared to the prior year. Home sales revenue in our Central segment increased 57 due to a 50 increase in new homes delivered and a 5 increase in average sales price. The increase in new homes delivered was due to a significant increase in backlog units to start the current-year period compared to the prior-year period. The average sales price in this segment benefited from strong market conditions in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, supporting stronger pricing power. Home sales revenue in our East segment increased by 47 due to a 40 increase in new homes delivered and a 5 increase in average sales price, driven by higher opening backlog and seasonally strong backlog conversion.

 (1) Non-GAA P financial measure (as discussed below). 
 
 Our homebuilding gross margin percentage increased to 23.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.3 for the prior-year period. This increase is primarily attributed to reduced incentives in the current-year period compared to the prior-year, during which demand had weakened significantly due to the onset of the rate-hiking cycle. As mortgage rates have remained elevated for an extended period, we have seen a gradual reduction in the need for incentives during the first half of the year, which has positively impacted our gross margins this quarter. Additionally, a shift in our revenue mix, with a higher contribution from our Central and East segments, has further improved gross margins. Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments in cost of home sales, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.6 for the prior-year period. 
 Adjusted homebuilding gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that leverage and noncash charges have on homebuilding gross margin and permits investors to make better

comparisons with our competitors, who adjust gross margins in a similar fashion. Because adjusted homebuilding gross margin is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the table above reconciling this non-GAAP financial measure to homebuilding gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

 Total SG A expense as a percentage of home sales revenue decreased to 10.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.3 in the prior-year period. Total SG A expense increased 19.2 million to 120.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 101.2 million in the prior-year period. 
 Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of home sales revenue decreased to 4.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.2 for the prior-year period. This decrease was largely due to higher home sales revenue, which improved our fixed cost leverage. Sales and marketing expense increased to 53.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 42.9 million for the prior-year period, largely driven by an increase in broker commissions, along with internal commissions and advertising expense. Given that many components of sales and marketing expense bear a variable relationship to home sales revenue, which increased by 35 compared to the prior-year period, such an increase in absolute dollars is expected. 
 General and administrative G A expense as a percentage of home sales revenue decreased to 6.0 of home sales revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.1 for the prior-year period. This decrease was due primarily to higher leverage on our fixed components of G A expenses, which is directly associated with the higher home sales revenue in the current-year period. G A expense increased to 66.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 58.4 million for the prior-year period, largely driven by an increase in wage and incentive compensation-related costs. 
 Interest 
 Interest, which we incurred principally to finance land acquisitions, land development and home construction, totaled 25.3 million and 36.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All interest incurred in both periods was capitalized. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was income of 6.7 million and 11.7 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest income stemming from fluctuations in our existing cash balances. 
 Income Tax 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a tax provision of 39.8 million based on an effective tax rate of 26.3 . For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a tax provision of 22.9 million based on an effective tax rate of 23.0 .

 Net new home orders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 327, or 6 , to 4,717, compared to 5,044 during the prior-year period. The decrease in net new home orders was due to a 10 decrease in monthly absorption rates, partially offset by a 5 increase in average selling communities. The current-year period began with strong momentum, but conditions moderated to more seasonally normal levels, particularly during the second and third quarters. While demand remains healthy, the prior-year period experienced heightened activity due to a more pronounced supply-demand imbalance, driven by limited resale inventory. Although this dynamic allowed homebuilders to capture a larger share of total home sales, the recent increase in monthly housing supply has tempered that impact somewhat. 
 - 33 - 

Our West segment reported a 10 decrease in net new home orders due to an 8 decrease in average selling communities along with a 2 decrease in monthly absorption rates. This change in average selling communities was largely due to strong demand in the West and our ability to sell through communities at a faster pace than we open new ones. Our Central segment reported a 1 increase in net new home orders due to a 29 increase in average selling communities, offset by a 22 decrease in monthly absorption rates. The 29 increase in average selling communities was due to growth in each of our Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Colorado markets. While the monthly absorption rate dipped by 22 year-over-year, demand remained seasonally normal in each of our Texas markets. We experienced softer market conditions in Colorado. Our East segment reported a 9 decrease in net new home orders due to a 7 decrease in monthly absorption rates and a 3 decrease in average selling communities. Despite the lower absorption rate compared to the prior-year period, demand in the East remained strong, exceeding seasonal expectations with a 4.3 absorption rate. The decrease in average selling communities was due to a decrease in Charlotte and Raleigh, where strong sales activity has resulted in selling through communities faster than our new community openings.

 Home sales revenue increased 752.3 million to 3.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior-year period. The increase was comprised of 840.7 million related to an 1,251-unit increase in new homes delivered in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a 86.5 million decrease related to a 25,000 decrease in average sales price for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We experienced significantly stronger order demand in the second half of 2023 compared to 2022, which helped propel our backlog units and dollar value by 58 and 38 , respectively, heading into the current-year period compared to the prior-year period. This increased backlog elevated our delivery potential for the current-year period, and our seasonally strong backlog conversions over the first nine month of 2024 have helped drive higher new home deliveries. Our ability to increase our backlog conversion rate in the current-year period is due to a combination of operational efficiency and our strategic shift to higher spec starts, resulting in a condensed timeframe from home sale to delivery. 
 Home sales revenue in our West segment increased 23 due to a 26 increase in new homes delivered, offset some by a 3 decrease in average sales price during the current-year period. The increase in new home deliveries was driven by a 25 higher backlog value at the beginning of the current year compared to the prior year. The slight decrease in average sales price was due to market and product mix factors, most notably in our San Diego market where the prior-year activity was positively impacted by some higher end communities in which the last unit closed in late 2023. Home sales revenue in our Central segment increased 59 due to a 66 increase in new homes delivered, offset by an 4 decrease in average sales price. The increase in new home deliveries was driven by a 96 higher backlog value at the beginning of the current year compared to the prior year. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased due primarily to a change in our product mix within our Houston market, along with some softer demand experienced in our Colorado market, resulting in higher incentives and weaker pricing power. Home sales revenue in our East segment increased by 25 due to an 25 increase in new homes delivered. The increase in new homes delivered was due to an increase in backlog units to start the current-year period compared to the prior-year period.

 Our homebuilding gross margin percentage increased to 23.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.0 for the prior-year period. This increase is primarily attributed to reduced incentives in the current period, compared to the prior-year when demand had weakened significantly due to the onset of the rate-hiking cycle. As mortgage rates have remained elevated for an extended period, we have seen a gradual reduction in the need for incentives, and have improved our incentives as a percentage of home sales revenue by 200 basis points compared to the prior-year period. Additionally, a shift in our revenue mix, with a higher contribution from our Central and East segments, has further improved gross margins. Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments in cost of home sales, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.6 for the prior-year period.

 Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of home sales revenue decreased to 5.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.3 for the prior-year period. This decrease was largely due to higher home sales revenue in the current-year period, helping to improve the operating leverage on fixed costs associated with sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased to 160.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 128.0 million for the prior-year period, largely driven by an increase in broker commissions, along with internal commissions and advertising expense. Given that many components of sales and marketing expense bear a variable relationship to home sales revenue, which increased by 31 compared to the prior-year period, such increase in absolute dollars is expected. 
 G A expense as a percentage of home sales revenue decreased to 5.9 of home sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.6 for the prior-year period.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our principal uses of capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were operating expenses, land purchases, land development, home construction and repurchases of our common stock. We used funds generated by our operations to meet our short-term working capital requirements. We monitor financing requirements to evaluate potential financing sources, including bank credit facilities and note offerings. We also continue to monitor the credit markets as we remain focused on generating positive margins in our homebuilding operations and acquiring desirable land positions in order to maintain a strong balance sheet and keep us poised for growth. As of September 30, 2024, we had total liquidity of 1.4 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of 676.0 million and 698.1 million of availability under our Credit Facility, as described below, after considering the borrowing base provisions and outstanding letters of credit. 
 Our board of directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets and the availability of particular assets, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service.

The Fourth Modification, among other things, amends the Credit Agreement to exclude (i) certain indebtedness of the Company s financial services subsidiaries for purposes of calculating the Company s Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (ii) the Company s financial services subsidiaries from the determination of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), as well as any interest obligations of the Company s financial services subsidiaries, for purposes of calculating the Company s Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Facility (as defined below), consists of a 750 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and a 250 million term loan facility (the Term Facility and together with the Revolving Facility, the Credit Facility ). Both the Revolving Facility and the Term Facility mature on June 29, 2027. We may increase the Credit Facility to not more than 1.2 billion in the aggregate, at our request, upon satisfaction of specified conditions. We may borrow under the Revolving Facility in the ordinary course of business to repay senior notes and fund our operations, including our land acquisition, land development and homebuilding activities. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility will be governed by, among other things, a borrowing base. Interest rates under the Revolving Facility will be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), plus a spread ranging from 1.25 to 1.90 , depending on the Company s leverage ratio. Interest rates under the Term Facility will be based on SOFR, plus a spread ranging from 1.10 to 1.85 , depending on the Company s leverage ratio. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding debt under the Revolving Facility and there was 698.1 million of availability after considering the borrowing base provisions and outstanding letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, we had 250 million of outstanding debt under the Term Facility with an interest rate of 5.93 . As of September 30, 2024, there were 4.0 million of capitalized debt financing costs, included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, related to the Credit Facility that will amortize over the remaining term of the Credit Facility. Accrued interest, including loan commitment fees, related to the Term Facility was 1.8 million and 1.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit of 51.9 million and 52.3 million, respectively. These letters of credit were issued to secure various financial obligations. We believe it is not probable that any outstanding letters of credit will be drawn upon. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 25.9 million and 38.3 million, respectively, outstanding related to two seller-financed loans. All seller-financed loans are to acquire lots for the construction of homes. Principal on these loans are expected to be fully paid by the end of fiscal year 2025, provided certain achievements are met. One of the seller-financed loans, representing 25.5 million of the total balance as of September 30, 2024 and 37.4 million of the balance as of December 31, 2023, accrues interest at an imputed interest rate of 4.50 per annum. The second seller-financed loan represented 0.4 million of the total balance as of September 30, 2024 and 910,000 as of December 31, 2023, respectively.

Under the Credit Facility, we are required to comply with certain finan cial covenants, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the table below (dollars in thousands): 
 Actual at September 30, Covenant Requirement at September 30, Financial Covenants 2024 2024 Consolidated Tangible Net Worth 3,089,035 2,160,551 (Not less than 1.58 billion plus 50 of net income and 50 of the net proceeds from equity offerings after 
 March 31, 2022) 
 Leverage Test 9.1 60 (Not to exceed 60 Interest Coverage Test 6.5 1.5 (Not less than 1.5:1.0) 
 
 In addition, the Credit Facility limits the aggregate number of single family dwellings (where construction has commenced) owned by the Company or any guarantor that are not presold or model units to no more than the greater of (i) 50 of the number of housing unit closings (as defined) during the preceding 12 months; or (ii) 100 of the number of housing unit closings during the preceding 6 months. However, a failure to comply with this Spec Unit Inventory Test will not be an event of default or default, but will be excluded from the borrowing base as of the last day of the quarter in which the non-compliance occurs. The Credit Facility further requires that at least 95.0 of consolidated tangible net worth must be attributable to the Company and its guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain grace periods. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On December 21, 2023, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the 2024 Repurchase Program ), authorizing the repurchase of shares of common stock with an aggregate value of up to 250 million through December 31, 2024. Purchases of common stock pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Program may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. We are not obligated under the 2024 Repurchase Program to repurchase any specific number or amount of shares of common stock, and we may modify, suspend or discontinue the program at any time. Company management will determine the timing and amount of any repurchases in its discretion based on a variety of factors, such as the market price of our common stock, corporate requirements, general market economic conditions, legal requirements and applicable tax effects. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and retired an aggregate of 272,777 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for 9.9 million, excluding commissions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and retired an aggregate of 2,761,624 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for 96.6 million, excluding commissions. 
 Leverage Ratios 
 We believe that our leverage ratios provide useful information to the users of our financial statements regarding our financial position and cash and debt management. The ratio of homebuilding debt-to-capital and the ratio of net homebuilding debt-to-net capital are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 - 39 - 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Loans payable 275,914 288,337 Senior notes 646,280 1,094,249 Mortgage repurchase facilities 75,465 Total debt 997,659 1,382,586 Less: mortgage repurchase facilities (75,465) Total homebuilding debt 922,194 1,382,586 Stockholders equity 3,249,952 3,010,958 Total capital 4,172,146 4,393,544 Ratio of homebuilding debt-to-capital(1) 22.1 31.5 Total homebuilding debt 922,194 1,382,586 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (675,957) (868,953) Net homebuilding debt 246,237 513,633 Stockholders equity 3,249,952 3,010,958 Net capital 3,496,189 3,524,591 Ratio of net homebuilding debt-to-net capital(2) 7.0 14.6 
 __________ 
 (1) The ratio of homebuilding debt-to-capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing total homebuilding debt by the sum of total homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity. 
 (2) The ratio of net homebuilding debt-to-net capital is a non-GAAP financial measure and is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net homebuilding debt (which is total homebuilding debt less cash and cash equivalents) by the sum of net homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of homebuilding debt-to-capital. We believe the ratio of net homebuilding debt-to-net capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. See the table above reconciling this non-GAAP financial measure to the ratio of homebuilding debt-to-capital. Because the ratio of net homebuilding debt-to-net capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Cash Flows Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 211.0 million to 335.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 124.8 million for the prior-year period. The increase was driven by a 173.4 million rise in cash from real estate inventories, a 114.3 million increase in net income, and a 60.9 million increase in cash provided by receivables. These sources of cash were offset by an 79.3 million decrease related to mortgage loans held for sales, as we initiated our loan origination business during the current-year period and this use of cash represents loans held on our balance sheet. In addition to these primary drivers, changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was an additional driver of the fluctuations in operating activities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 25.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used of 25.6 million for the prior-year period. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 503.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 139.9 million for the prior-year period. Net cash used in financing activities in the current-year period was primarily comprised of the 450 million of 5.875 Senior Notes due 2024 we redeemed in May 2024. Additionally, cash used in financing activities was comprised of 96.6 million of cash used for share repurchases, compared to 124.5 million during the prior-year period. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into purchase contracts in order to procure lots for the construction of our homes. We are subject to customary obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved lots. These purchase contracts typically require a cash deposit and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the sellers, including obtaining applicable property and development 
 - 40 - 

entitlements. We also utilize option contracts with land sellers and land banking arrangements as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns, to help us manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings, and to reduce the use of funds from our corporate financing sources. These option contracts and land banking arrangements generally require a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire land and lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices. We generally have the right, at our discretion, to terminate our obligations under both purchase contracts and option contracts by forfeiting our cash deposit with no further financial responsibility to the land seller. In some cases, however, we may be contractually obligated to complete development work even if we terminate the option to procure land or lots. As of September 30, 2024, we had 223.7 million of cash deposits, the majority of which are non-refundable, pertaining to land and lot option contracts and purchase contracts with an aggregate remaining purchase price of 2.1 billion (net of deposits). See Note 7, Variable Interest Entities , to the accompanying condensed notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our utilization of land and lot option contracts and land banking arrangements is dependent on, among other things, the availability of land sellers or land banking firms willing to enter into such arrangements, the availability of capital to finance the development of optioned land and lots, general housing market conditions, and local market dynamics. Options may be more difficult to procure from land sellers in strong housing markets and are more prevalent in certain geographic regions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held equity investments in fourteen active homebuilding partnerships or limited liability companies. Our participation in these entities may be as a developer, a builder, or an investment partner. See Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, to the accompanying condensed notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes 
 On June 5, 2017, Tri Pointe issued the 2027 Notes and on June 10, 2020, Tri Pointe issued the 2028 Notes. All of Tri Pointe s 100 owned subsidiaries that are guarantors (each a Guarantor and, collectively, the Guarantors of the Credit Facility, including Tri Pointe Homes Holdings, are party to supplemental indentures pursuant to which they jointly and severally guarantee Tri Pointe s obligations with respect to these Notes. Each Guarantor of the 2027 Notes and the 2028 Notes is 100 owned by Tri Pointe, and all guarantees are full and unconditional, subject to customary exceptions pursuant to the indentures governing the 2027 Notes and the 2028 Notes, as described in the following paragraph. All of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries have nominal assets and operations and are considered minor, as defined in Rule 3-10(h) of Regulation S-X. In addition, Tri Pointe has no independent assets or operations, as defined in Rule 3-10(h) of Regulation S-X. There are no significant restrictions upon the ability of Tri Pointe or any Guarantor to obtain funds from any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries by dividend or loan. None of the assets of our subsidiaries represent restricted net assets pursuant to Rule 4-08(e)(3) of Regulation S-X. 
 A Guarantor of the 2027 Notes and the 2028 Notes shall be released from all of its obligations under its guarantee if (i) all of the assets of the Guarantor have been sold; (ii) all of the equity interests of the Guarantor held by Tri Pointe or a subsidiary thereof have been sold; (iii) the Guarantor merges with and into Tri Pointe or another Guarantor, with Tri Pointe or such other Guarantor surviving the merger; (iv) the Guarantor is designated unrestricted for covenant purposes; (v) the Guarantor ceases to guarantee any indebtedness of Tri Pointe or any other Guarantor which gave rise to such Guarantor guaranteeing the 2027 Notes or the 2028 Notes; (vi) Tri Pointe exercises its legal defeasance or covenant defeasance options; or (vii) all obligations under the applicable supplemental indenture are discharged. 
 Inflation 
 Inflation in the United States persisted at a moderate level for the first half of 2024, although it significantly improved from its peak in 2022. While the Federal Reserve s interest rate hikes have helped curb inflation, prevailing inflation rates remain elevated as compared to their desired target, and the future path of Federal Reserve policy is uncertain. Our operations can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material and construction costs. In addition, inflation can lead to higher and more volatile mortgage rates, which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to homebuyers, as well as the confidence of our consumer base. While we attempt to pass on cost increases to customers through increased prices, when weak housing market conditions exist, we are often unable to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. 
 - 41 - 

Seasonality 
 We have experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically take orders for more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half, which creates additional working capital requirements in the second and third quarters to build our inventories to satisfy the deliveries in the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry. In addition to the overall volume of orders and deliveries, our operating results in a given quarter are significantly affected by the number and characteristics of our active selling communities; timing of new community openings; the timing of land and lot sales; and the mix of product types, geographic locations and average sales prices of the homes delivered during the quarter. Therefore, our operating results in any given quarter will fluctuate compared to prior periods based on these factors. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of judgment in the application of accounting policies and estimates of uncertain matters. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 See Note 1, Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the accompanying condensed notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our outstanding debt. We did not utilize swaps, forward or option contracts on interest rates or commodities, or other types of derivative financial instruments as of or during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We did not enter into during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and currently do not hold, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (the Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the Principal Financial Officer ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of senior management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
