Total operating revenues 

Although our revenues are principally derived from customers domiciled in the U.S., the ultimate points of origination or destination for some products we transport are outside the U.S. Each of our commodity groups includes revenues from shipments to and from Mexico. Included in the above table are revenues from our Mexico business, which amounted to million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and billion and billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

Stock Options Stock options are granted at the closing price on the date of grant, have -year contractual terms, and vest no later than years from the date of grant. None of the stock options outstanding at September 30, 2024 , is subject to performance or market-based vesting conditions. 
 
 The table below shows the annual weighted-average assumptions used for Black-Scholes valuation purposes: 

Dividend yield 

Expected life (years) 

Volatility 

Weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted 

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the expected dividend yield is calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of grant; the expected life is based on historical and expected exercise behavior; and expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the stock option.

Nonvested at September 30, 2024 

At September 30, 2024 , there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. 
 
 Performance Stock Unit Awards In February 2024 , our Board of Directors approved performance stock unit grants. This plan is based on performance targets for annual return on invested capital (ROIC) and operating income growth (OIG) compared to companies in the S P 100 Industrials Index plus the Class I railroads. We define ROIC as net operating profit adjusted for interest expense (including interest on average operating lease liabilities) and taxes on interest divided by average invested capital adjusted for average operating lease liabilities. 

The February 
 2024 
 stock units awarded to executives are subject to continued employment for months, the attainment of certain levels of ROIC, and the relative three -year OIG. We expense two -thirds of the fair value of the units that are probable of being earned based on our forecasted ROIC over the three -year performance period, and with respect to the third year of the plan, we expense the remaining one - third of the fair value subject to the relative three -year OIG. We measure the fair value of performance stock units based upon the closing price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. Dividend equivalents are accumulated during the service period and paid to participants only after the units are earned. 

Changes in our performance stock unit awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were as follows:

At September 30, 2024 , there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested performance stock unit awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. This expense is subject to achievement of the performance measures established for the performance stock unit grants. 

-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and, if necessary, amortized as pension expense. 
 
 The components of our net periodic pension benefit/cost were as follows:

Cash Contributions 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , cash contributions totaled to the qualified pension plans. Any contributions made during 2024 will be based on cash generated from operations and financial market considerations. Our policy with respect to funding the qualified pension plans is to fund at least the minimum required by law and not more than the maximum amount deductible for tax purposes. At September 30, 2024 , we do not have minimum cash funding requirements for 2024 .

million. Receivables not expected to be collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. At September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , receivables classified as other assets were reduced by allowances of million and million, respectively. 
 
 Receivables Securitization Facility The Railroad maintains an million, -year receivables securitization facility (the Receivables Facility) maturing in July 2025 . Under the Receivables Facility, the Railroad sells most of its eligible third -party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a consolidated, wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse, an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors. The investors have no recourse to the Railroad s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI. 
 
 The amount recorded under the Receivables Facility was at both September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued million and repaid million under the Receivables Facility. The Receivables Facility was supported by billion of accounts receivable as collateral at both September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , which, as a retained interest, is included in accounts receivable, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
 
 The outstanding amount the Railroad maintains under the Receivables Facility may fluctuate based on current cash needs. The maximum allowed under the Receivables Facility is million with availability directly impacted by eligible receivables, business volumes, and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios. If default or dilution ratios increase one percent, the allowable outstanding amount under the Receivables Facility would not materially change. 

The costs of the Receivables Facility include interest, which will vary based on prevailing benchmark and commercial paper rates, program fees paid to participating banks, commercial paper issuance costs, and fees of participating banks for unused commitment availability. The costs of the Receivables Facility are included in interest expense and were million and million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 , respectively, and million and million for the 
 nine 
 months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 , respectively.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of our short- and long-term debt was estimated using a market value price model, which utilizes applicable U.S. Treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities. All of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the Corporation s long-term debt are Level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source. At September 30, 2024 , the fair value of total debt was billion, approximately billion less than the carrying value. At December 31, 2023 , the fair value of total debt was billion, approximately billion less than the carrying value. The fair value of the Corporation s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. The fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Credit facility withdrawals totaled during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the Facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The Facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus a spread, depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt. The Facility, set to expire May 20, 2027 , requires UPC to maintain an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) coverage ratio. 

The definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the adjusted debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio includes, among other things, certain credit arrangements, finance leases, guarantees, unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs. At 
 September 30, 2024 
 , the Company was in compliance with the adjusted debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio, which allows us to carry up to billion of debt (as defined in the Facility), and we had

billion of debt (as defined in the Facility) outstanding at that date. The Facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. The Facility also includes a million cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we issued million and repaid million of commercial paper with maturities ranging from to days, and at September 30, 2024 , we had million of commercial paper with a weighted average interest rate of outstanding. Our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances, and, unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program, our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the Facility. 
 
 Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings We filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that became effective on February 13, 2024. The Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to billion of debt securities, replacing the prior Board authorization in February 2022, which had billion of authority remaining. Under our shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we did not issue any debt securities under this registration statement. At September 30, 2024 , we had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to issue up to billion of debt securities under our shelf registration. 
 
 Receivables Securitization Facility As of both September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , we recorded of borrowings under our Receivables Facility as secured debt. (See further discussion in the "Receivables Securitization Facility" section of Note 10 ). 

of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately is related to unasserted claims at September 30, 2024 . Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately million to million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.

Environmental Costs We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified sites where we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, including that are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.

The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third -parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
 
 Indemnities Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions. 

million shares of our common stock by March 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024 , we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock under the 2022 authorization. These repurchases may be made on the open market or through other transactions. Our management has sole discretion with respect to determining the timing and amount of these transactions.

Management's assessments of market conditions and other pertinent factors guide the timing, manner, and volume of all repurchases. We expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand. Open market repurchases are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions, fees, and excise taxes. 

economic interest in TTX while the other North American railroads own the remaining interest. In accordance with ASC 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Venture , UPRR applies the equity method of accounting to our investment in TTX. 
 
 TTX is a rail car pooling company that owns rail cars and intermodal wells to serve North America s railroads. TTX assists railroads in meeting the needs of their customers by providing rail cars in an efficient, pooled environment. All railroads may utilize TTX rail cars through car hire by renting rail cars at stated rates. 
 
 UPRR had billion and billion recognized as investments related to TTX in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively. TTX car hire expense of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, are included in equipment and other rents in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, UPRR had accounts payable to TTX of million and million at September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively.

 UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 , Compared to 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to "Union Pacific", UPC , Corporation , Company , we , us , and our shall mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which we separately refer to as UPRR or the Railroad . 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1, and other information included in this report. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). 
 
 The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. Although revenues are analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. If these estimates differ materially from actual results, the impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may be material. Our critical accounting estimates are available in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the first nine months of 2024 , there have not been any significant changes with respect to our critical accounting estimates. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Quarterly Summary 
 
 The Company reported earnings of 2.75 per diluted share on net income of 1.7 billion and an operating ratio of 60.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to earnings of 2.51 per diluted share on net income of 1.5 billion and an operating ratio of 63.4 for the third quarter of 2023. Freight revenues increased 4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by 6 volume increase and core pricing gains, partially offset by negative mix (for example, a relative increase in international intermodal shipments, which have a lower average revenue per car (ARC)) and lower fuel surcharge revenues. Volume increases were primarily driven by international intermodal and grain, partially offset by weaker demand for coal and rock shipments. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024 our network absorbed the additional volume including a surge in international intermodal business, which increased 33 compared to last year. As volume increased, crews and locomotives were strategically integrated into the network to efficiently handle the growth. As a result, most of our operating metrics improved compared to the third quarter of 2023. Both freight car velocity and locomotive productivity improved 5 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Workforce productivity improved 12 as our total train, engine, and yard (TE Y) employees were flat year-over-year while the remainder of our workforce declined 8 . Our TE Y training pipeline declined 6 year-over-year demonstrating a shift to additional active employees to cover increased needs associated with fewer available workdays because of sick leave benefits and work/rest agreements (labor agreements) and increased volume. Manifest/automotive service performance index, intermodal service performance index, and train length, all improved from the third quarter of 2023.

Operating expenses decreased 2 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to productivity, lower fuel prices, and a 2023 write-off. These decreases were partially offset by inflation, volume-related costs, and higher depreciation. Operating income of 2.4 billion increased 11 , and our operating ratio of 60.3 improved 3.1 points from the third quarter of 2023.

We generate freight revenues by transporting products from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues vary with volume (carloads) and ARC. Changes in price, traffic mix, and fuel surcharges drive ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available historical, current, and forecasted volumes, and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenues between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. 
 
 Other subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenues between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied. 
 
 Freight revenues increased 4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by a 6 volume increase and core pricing gains, partially offset by negative mix (for example, a relative increase in international intermodal shipments, which have a lower ARC) and lower fuel surcharge revenues. Volume increases were primarily driven by international intermodal and grain, partially offset by weaker demand for coal and rock shipments. 
 
 Each of our commodity groups includes revenues from fuel surcharges. Freight revenues from fuel surcharge programs decreased 2 million to 635 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 637 million in the same period of 2023 due to lower fuel prices, partially offset by the lag impact on fuel prices (it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries), and higher volume. 
 
 Other subsidiary revenues decreased in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by a weaker demand for intermodal shipments at our subsidiary that brokers intermodal and transload logistics services and the partial transfer of our commuter operations to Metra. Accessorial revenues decreased in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023 driven by lower intermodal accessorial revenues as a result of our intermodal equipment sale. In addition, the year-to-date period was positively impacted by a one-time contract settlement in the first quarter of 2024.

Table of Contents 

Bulk Bulk includes shipments of grain and grain products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated, and coal and renewables. Freight revenues from bulk shipments increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 due to a positive mix of traffic from decreased coal shipments and core pricing gains, partially offset by a decline in volume. Volume declines were driven by reduced use of coal in electricity generation because of low natural gas prices, partially offset by strength in export grain and several other grain commodities. Year-to-date, freight revenues decreased compared to the same period in 2023 due to decreased volume and lower fuel surcharge revenues, partially offset by a positive mix of traffic and core pricing gains. Year-to-date, coal volumes were negatively impacted by mild winter weather in addition to reduced coal usage, partially offset by first quarter 2023 outages and service challenges due to repeated snow events in Wyoming that negatively impacted coal volumes. Additionally, the volume declines in the year-to-date period were partially offset by increased fertilizer shipments in the second quarter of 2024 due to strong demand and a 2023 customer outage. 
 
 Industrial Industrial includes shipments of industrial chemicals and plastics, metals and minerals, forest products, and energy and specialized markets. Freight revenues from industrial shipments increased in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023 due to core pricing gains and positive mix of traffic from decreased short haul rock shipments and higher soda ash shipments, partially offset by volume declines and lower fuel surcharge revenues. Volume decreases in both periods of 2024 compared to 2023 were driven by lower demand for rock, due to weather, high inventories, and softness in Southern markets, partially offset by strength in petroleum, plastics, and industrial chemicals. 
 
 Premium Premium includes shipments of finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. Premium freight revenues increased in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023 due to increased volume and core pricing gains, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix. In the third quarter of 2024, international intermodal experienced heavy demand due to increased U.S. West Coast imports, a result of freight shifted from the East Coast and Canadian ports due to uncertainty related to labor negotiations, driving volume up 33 compared to the third quarter 2023. In addition, business development efforts in domestic intermodal drove volume growth in both periods of 2024 compared to 2023. Finished automotive shipments increased in the year-to-date period of 2024 compared to 2023 driven by business development wins, partially offset by unplanned production decreases. 
 
 Mexico Business Each of our commodity groups includes revenues from shipments to and from Mexico. Revenues from Mexico business increased 7 to 724 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 driven by a 2 volume increase and a 5 increase in ARC. Year-to-date, revenues from Mexico business increased 9 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by a 4 volume increase and a 5 increase in ARC. Volume increases in both periods were driven by higher grain, partially offset by lower automotive parts shipments. In addition, increased finished automotive shipments contributed to the year-to-date volume growth.

Operating expenses decreased in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023 driven by productivity, lower fuel prices, and a 2023 write-off. These decreases were partially offset by inflation, volume-related costs, and higher depreciation. Additionally, year-to-date, the 2023 labor agreement ratification charge, a gain on the sale of intermodal equipment in 2024, and lower weather-related costs from less impactful winter weather in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, positively impacted the year-over-year comparison. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, and incentive costs. For the third quarter of 2024, expense increased 2 compared to 2023 due to wage inflation, partially offset by lower employee levels. Year-to-date expense was flat as the 2023 labor agreement ratification charge and lower employee levels in 2024 offset wage inflation and increased crew needs associated with labor agreements and volume.

Table of Contents 

Fuel Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Fuel expense decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by a decrease in locomotive diesel fuel prices, partially offset by an increase in gross ton-miles and a 1 increase in the fuel consumption rate (computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands). Locomotive diesel fuel prices averaged 2.60 and 3.12 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Year-to-date, fuel expense decreased driven by lower locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged 2.71 compared to 3.07 per gallon in the same period of 2023, and a slight improvement in the fuel consumption rate, partially offset by increased gross ton-miles. 
 
 Purchased Services and Materials Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expense incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad s lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expense; and tools and supplies. Purchased services and materials decreased 4 in both periods of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to declines in our active locomotive fleet as productivity improved in both periods and decreased volume-related drayage cost incurred at one of our subsidiaries, partially offset by inflation and volume-related costs. In addition, the year-to-date period was positively impacted by a contract settlement. 
 
 Depreciation The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. Depreciation expense was up 4 for both periods of 2024 compared to 2023, driven by a higher depreciable asset base. 
 
 Equipment and Other Rents Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expense, offset by equity income from certain equity method investments. Equipment and other rents expense increased 1 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, driven by inflation and increased demand in commodities utilizing freight cars owned by others, partially offset by lower lease expense. Year-to-date expense decreased 6 compared to the same period of 2023, driven by lower lease expense and improved cycle times, partially offset by increased demand in commodities utilizing freight cars owned by others and inflation. 
 
 Other Other expense includes state and local taxes; freight, equipment, and property damage; utilities; insurance; personal injury; environmental remediation; employee travel; telephone and cellular; computer software; bad debt; and other general expenses. Other expense decreased 6 and 4 in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2024 compared to 2023, respectively, driven by lower personal injury costs and a 2023 write-off, partially offset by higher freight loss and damage, and other casualty costs. Additionally, year-to-date expense was lower due to a gain on the sale of intermodal equipment in the second quarter of 2024.

Other Income, net Other income decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 driven by lower real estate income. Year-to-date, other income decreased due to a one-time 107 million real estate transaction in 2023, partially offset by interest received in 2024 from the IRS on refund claims. 
 
 Interest Expense Interest expense decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024 compared to 2023 due to a decreased weighted-average debt level. The weighted-average debt levels were 31.4 billion and 31.8 billion in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024, respectively, compared to 33.0 billion and 33.3 billion in the same periods of 2023, respectively. The effective interest rate was 4.0 in both periods of 2024 compared to 4.1 and 4.0 in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2023, respectively. 
 
 Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2024 compared to 2023 driven by higher pre-tax income and lower deferred tax adjustments. In the third quarter of 2023, the states of Iowa, Kansas, and Arkansas enacted legislation to reduce their corporate income tax rate for future years resulting in a 41 million reduction of our deferred tax expense. Additionally, in the year-to-date period of 2023, the state of Nebraska enacted legislation to reduce its corporate income tax rate for future years resulting in a reduction of our deferred tax expense of 73 million. Our effective tax rates for year-to-date 2024 and 2023 were 23.5 and 21.9 , respectively.

 As reported to the STB. 

Gross and Revenue Ton-Miles Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles. Gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles increased 4 and 1 , respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, while carloadings increased 6 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023. For the year-to-date periods, gross ton-miles increased 1 and revenue ton-miles decreased 1 , while carloadings were up 2 year-over-year. Changes in commodity mix drove the year-over-year variances between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads due to lower coal shipments, which are generally heavier, and increased international intermodal shipments that are generally lighter. 
 
 Freight Car Velocity Freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. The two key drivers of this metric are the speed of the train between terminals (average train speed) and the time a rail car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). Freight car velocity increased 5 and 3 in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023, respectively, driven by improvements in terminal dwell. 
 
 Locomotive Productivity Locomotive productivity is gross ton-miles per average daily locomotive horsepower available. Locomotive productivity increased 5 and 7 in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024, respectively, compared to 2023 driven by improved network fluidity and asset utilization. Throughout the year, we maintained a buffer to flex the fleet size as we experienced and subsequently recovered from certain weather events and reacted to varying volume levels. 
 
 Train Length Train length is the average maximum train length on a route measured in feet. Our train length increased slightly and 1 in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023, respectively, due to train length improvement initiatives and increases in international intermodal shipments, which generally move on longer trains, partially offset by declines in coal train length.

Service Performance Index (SPI) SPI is a ratio of the service customers are currently receiving relative to the best monthly performance over the last three years. Measuring our performance relative to a historical benchmark demonstrates our focus on continuously improving service for our customers, and we believe it is a better indicator of service performance than the previously disclosed trip plan compliance. SPI does not replace the service commitments we have contractually agreed to with a small number of customers. Our SPI is calculated for intermodal and manifest/automotive products. Intermodal SPI improved 1 and 5 points in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023, respectively, at the same time as international volume surged. Manifest/automotive SPI improved 5 and 4 points in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 compared to 2023, respectively. The year-to-date period improved in 2024 compared to 2023 despite the impact of 2024 weather events. 
 
 Workforce Productivity Workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee. Workforce productivity improved 12 and 6 in the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024, respectively, as average daily car miles increased 6 and 2 and employees decreased 5 and 4 , respectively, compared to 2023. In the third quarter and year-to-date periods, our active TE Y workforce increased to support carload demand and increased crew needs associated with labor agreements that went into effect in third quarter of 2023. In addition, we are maintaining an adequate training pipeline to provide a capacity buffer to enable responsiveness in an ever-changing demand and operating environment. 
 
 Operating Ratio Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenues. Our operating ratio of 60.3 improved 3.1 points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 and our year-to-date operating ratio of 60.4 improved 2.4 points compared to 2023 driven by productivity initiatives, core pricing gains, and the year-over-year impact from lower fuel prices, partially offset by inflation and other costs. In addition, the year-to-date period was positively impacted by 2024 contract settlements, a 2024 gain on the sale of intermodal equipment, and the 2023 labor agreement ratification charge.

Table of Contents 

Adjusted debt (total debt plus operating lease liabilities plus after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB (other post-retirement benefit) obligations) to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and adjustments for other income and interest on present value of operating leases) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the Company s ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the Company s credit rating. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is debt to net income ratio. The tables above provide reconciliations from net income to adjusted EBITDA, debt to adjusted debt, and debt to net income to adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. At September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.7 and 3.6 , respectively. Pension and OPEB were funded at September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 .

Capital Plan 
 
 In 2024 , we expect our capital plan to be approximately 3.4 billion, down 8 from 2023 . Roughly half of the year-over-year decrease is attributable to the 2023 purchase of a small trucking and transload operator and related real estate assets. We plan to continue to make investments to support our growth strategy, harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. In addition, the plan includes investments in growth-related projects to drive more carloads to the network, certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from intermodal customers, continued modernization of our locomotive fleet, and projects intended to improve operational efficiency. The capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 driven by a decrease in debt issued and an increase in share repurchases. 

See Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings and Note 16 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our share repurchase programs. 

Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. Cash flow conversion rate is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capital investments as a ratio of net income. 
 
 Free cash flow and cash flow conversion rate are not considered financial measures under GAAP by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe free cash flow and cash flow conversion rate are important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without external financing. Free cash flow and cash flow conversion rate should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities.

Current Liquidity Status 
 
 We are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the impact on our ability to generate cash. These analyses inform our liquidity plans and activities outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we generated 2.7 billion of cash provided by operating activities, repurchased 738 million worth of shares under our share repurchase programs, and paid our quarterly dividend. On September 30, 2024, we had 947 million of cash and cash equivalents, 2.0 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility, and 800 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants.

As described in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets, as of the date of this filing, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are like those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.

 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management, including the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Additionally, the CEO and CFO determined that there were no changes to the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation that occur in connection with our business. We routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and, when necessary, we seek input from our third-party advisors when making these assessments. Consistent with SEC rules and requirements, we describe below material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business), material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, other proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental laws and regulations (including governmental proceedings involving potential fines, penalties, or other monetary sanctions in excess of 1,000,000), and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 We receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the U.S., including sites on the Superfund National Priorities List or state superfund lists. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. 
 
 Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Environmental, Item 7, and Note 17 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.

SUPPLEMENTAL THRIFT PLAN 
 (409A Grandfathered Component) 

of 

UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION 

(Effective as of January 1, 2009, including all amendments adopted through August 1, 2024) 

ARTICLE ONE 

Scope of Plan and Definitions 

1.1 Purpose and Scope of Plan - The purpose of the Plan (this and other capitalized terms having the meanings set forth below) is to provide benefits to Eligible Employees who participate in the Thrift Plan in excess of those permitted under the Thrift Plan because of the limitations set forth in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code. To the extent that benefits are provided under the Plan, solely because of the limitations set forth in Section 415 of the Code, the Company intends to maintain the Plan as an excess benefit plan as that term is defined in Section 3(36) of ERISA. The rights of each Participant and his Beneficiaries to benefits under the Plan shall be governed by the Plan as set forth herein and as it may hereafter be amended from time to time. This Plan was effective January 1, 2009, unless expressly provided otherwise herein, and has since been amended, and is now further amended and restated effective August 1, 2024 as set forth herein . 

1.2 Applicability - The Supplemental Thrift Plan was bifurcated into two components, effective January 1, 2009. As reflected in the terms of this Plan, one such component is applicable solely to those amounts that were, as of December 31, 2004, both credited to a Participant s Account and fully vested in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Thrift Plan as in effect on December 31, 2004 (including related investment gains and losses occurring thereafter), which terms were not materially modified after October 3, 2004. With respect to any other amounts credited to a Participant s account under the Supplemental Thrift Plan, the rights of the Participant and his Beneficiaries shall be governed by the component of the Supplemental Thrift Plan known as the Supplemental Thrift Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component) of Union Pacific Corporation, effective January 1, 2009 as it may hereafter be amended from time to time. Prior to January 1, 2009, with respect to all amounts credited under the Supplemental Thrift Plan that were subject to section 409A of the Code, the Supplemental Thrift Plan was administered in good faith compliance with section 409A of the Code. 

1.3 Definitions - As used in the Plan, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context: 

(a) Account shall mean the entries maintained on the books of the Company which represent a Participant s interest under the Plan. The term Account shall refer, as the context indicates, to either or both of the following: 

(1) A Account shall mean the Account which shows amounts credited to a Participant pursuant to Section 2.1 of the Supplemental Thrift Plan as in effect on December 31, 2004, valued in accordance with Section 2.1 and adjusted for payments made pursuant to Section 3.1. 

(2) B Account shall mean the Account which shows amounts credited to a participant pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Supplemental Thrift Plan as in effect on December 31, 2004, valued in accordance with Section 2.1 and adjusted for payments made pursuant to Section 3.1. 

1

Under no circumstances shall a Participant s Account be deemed to include amounts (including investment gains and losses thereon) which under the terms of the Supplemental Thrift Plan were credited after December 31, 2004 or were not vested as of that date. 

(b) Beneficiary shall mean the person designated by a Participant to receive his interest under the Thrift Plan in the event of his death, unless the Participant designates a different person to be his Beneficiary hereunder pursuant to procedures adopted by the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration. If a Participant has made no such designation under the Thrift Plan, the Participant shall designate the person to be his Beneficiary hereunder pursuant to procedures adopted by the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration. Absent such designation, the Participant s Beneficiary shall be his estate. 

(c) Participant shall mean any person who has an Account which has not been distributed pursuant to Section 3.1. 

(d) Plan shall mean the Union Pacific Corporation Supplemental Thrift Plan (409A Grandfathered Component), as amended and restated in its entirety effective as of January 1, 2009 as set forth herein, and as it may hereafter be amended from time to time. 

(e) Supplemental Thrift Plan shall mean the Union Pacific Corporation Supplemental Thrift Plan, effective January 1, 1989, and as it may thereafter be amended from time to time. The Supplemental Thrift Plan is comprised of the following components, each of which is set forth in a separate document: (1) The Union Pacific Corporation Supplemental Thrift Plan (409A Grandfathered Component), and (2) The Union Pacific Corporation Supplemental Thrift Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component). 

(f) Thrift Plan shall mean the Union Pacific Corporation Thrift Plan, as in effect as of January 1, 1989, and as it may thereafter be amended from time to time. 

1.4 Terms Defined in the Thrift Plan - For all purposes of the Plan, the following terms shall have the meanings specified in the Thrift Plan, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context: Affiliated Company Board of Directors Code Company ERISA Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration and Separation from Service provided, however, that in determining if a Separation from Service has occurred, the initial public offering of Overnite Corporation that is the subject of Form S-1 Registration Statement No. 333-107614 shall be disregarded. 

1.5 Other Definitional Provisions - The terms defined in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of the Plan shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. The masculine pronoun, whenever used, shall include the feminine and vice versa . The words hereof, herein and hereunder and words of similar import when used in the Plan shall refer to the Plan as a whole and not to any particular provision of the Plan, unless otherwise specified. 

2

ARTICLE TWO 

Valuation of Accounts 

2.1 Valuation of Accounts - Pending distribution pursuant to Section 3.1, the value of amounts credited to a Participant s A and B Accounts as of any subsequent date shall be determined by the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration as follows: 

(a) except as provided in (b) and (c) below, as if such amounts had instead been actually contributed to the Thrift Plan and been invested in accordance with the investment provisions set forth in Article VI (effective August 8, 2007, without regard to Section 6.05A) thereof, provided that investment elections for purposes of the Plan may differ from those made by such Participant under the Thrift Plan; or 

(b) except as provided in (c) below, after a Participant s accounts under the Thrift Plan are transferred to another defined contribution plan maintained within the controlled group of corporations of which the Company is the common parent, as if such Accounts had been actual investments transferred to such transferee plan and been invested in accordance with the investment provisions set forth in such transferee plan (effective August 8, 2007, without regard to a provision, if any, in such transferee plan permitting participants in such transferee plan to participate in the Vanguard Advisers Managed Account Program), provided that investment elections for purposes of the Plan may differ from those made by such Participant under such transferee plan; or 

(c) effective May 1, 1991 for a Participant who is subject to the restrictions under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as if such amounts had instead been actually contributed to the Thrift Plan and been invested in accordance with the investment provisions set forth in Article VI (effective August 8, 2007, without regard to Section 6.05A) thereof except that the Participant must make separate investment elections for purposes of this Plan so that no amount will be treated as if it were actually invested in the Company common stock fund and may make other investment elections for purposes of the Plan that differ from those made under the Thrift Plan.

ARTICLE THREE 

Payments 

3.1 Payments on Separation from Service - 

(a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b), as soon as administratively practicable following the completion of the first valuation of a Participant s Account pursuant to Section 2.1 which coincides with or next follows the Participant s Separation from Service, the value of the Participant s Account at the time of such Separation from Service shall be paid to the Participant or, if such Participant is not living at the time of payment, to such Participant s Beneficiaries in a single lump-sum payment in cash. 

(b) A Participant may elect in writing at least six (6) months prior to his Separation from Service and in the tax year prior to his Separation from Service to have his Account paid to him or, if such Participant is not living at the time of payment, to such Participant s Beneficiaries, in accordance with one of the following forms: 

(1) A single lump-sum distribution as provided in subparagraph (a) payable in the year of the Participant s Separation from Service or (if elected by the Participant) January of the next year following such Separation from Service; 

(2) Annual installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years, such installment period to be elected by the Participant, beginning as soon as administratively practicable following: (A) the Participant s Separation from Service or (B), if elected by the Participant, January of the next year following such Separation from Service, with (under either option) subsequent installments paid in January of each subsequent year, provided that all subsequent installments will be paid in the next succeeding January, with each installment determined by dividing the value of the Participant s vested Account by the number of installments remaining to be made; or 

(3) A single lump-sum distribution payable in January of a year following the Participant s Separation from Service that is not later than fifteen (15) years from the Participant s Separation from Service, such year to be elected by the Participant. The amount of such distribution shall equal the balance in the Participant s Account at such specified date. Pending the lump-sum distribution as aforesaid, the Participant s Account shall continue to be invested in accordance with Article Two. At the end of each calendar quarter following the Participant s Separation from Service, the net increase or decrease in the value of the Account, measured from the first valuation of such Account pursuant to Article Two which coincides with or next follows the Participant s Separation from Service, shall be determined. The amount of any such net increase for any calendar quarter shall be distributed to the Participant within thirty (30) days following the end of such calendar quarter. 

4

(c) On the death of a Participant whose Account is payable under (b)(2) or (3), the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration, in her sole discretion, may accelerate one or more installments or payments, and change the form of payment or distribution in accordance with this Section 3.1, of any balance of a Participant s Account. 

3.2 Payments Prior to Separation From Service A Participant may request a withdrawal from his Account prior to his Separation from Service by filing a request with the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration. Any withdrawal under this Section will be charged with a 10 early withdrawal penalty that will be withheld from the amount withdrawn and such amount withheld shall be irrevocably forfeited. All withdrawals shall be made pro-rata from the investment funds in which the Participant s Account are invested at the time of the withdrawal. 

3.3 All payments attributable to credits made hereunder on behalf of a Participant shall be made by the Company on its own behalf or on behalf of the Affiliated Company by who such Participant was employed when such credits were made. Such Affiliated Company shall reimburse the Company for all amounts paid on its behalf. 

ARTICLE FOUR 

Administration 

4.1 Responsibilities and Powers of the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration - The Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration shall be solely responsible for the operation and administration of the Plan and shall have all powers necessary and appropriate to carry out her responsibilities in operating and administering the Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration shall have the responsibility and power to interpret the Plan, to make factual determinations and to determine whether a credit should be made on behalf of a Participant, the amount of the credit and the value of the amount so credited on any subsequent date. The determination of the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration, made in good faith, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons, including Participants and their Beneficiaries. 

4.2 Outside Services - The Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration may engage counsel and such clerical, medical, financial, investment, accounting and other specialized services as she may deem necessary or desirable to the operation and administration of the Plan. The Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in any action or determination or omission taken or made or omitted in good faith in so relying, upon any opinions, reports or other advice which is furnished by counsel or other specialist engaged for that purpose. 

4.3 Indemnification - The Company shall indemnify the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration against any and all claims, loss, damages, expense (including reasonable counsel fees) and liability arising from any action or failure to act or other conduct in her official capacity, except when the same is due to her own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

4.4 Claims Procedures - The claims procedures set forth in Article XIII of the Thrift Plan shall apply to any claim for benefits hereunder, subject to such changes as the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration deems necessary or appropriate. 

5

ARTICLE FIVE 

Amendment and Termination 

5.1 Amendment - The Board of Directors reserves the right at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate to conform with governmental regulations or other policies, to modify or amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the Plan. In addition, the chief human resources officer of Union Pacific Railroad Company or such other officer or employee of Union Pacific Railroad Company or the Company with similar authority may make (a) all technical, administrative, regulatory and compliance amendments to the Plan, (b) any amendment to the Plan necessary or appropriate to conform the Plan to changes in the Thrift Plan, and (c) any other amendment to the Plan that will not significantly increase the cost of the Plan to the Company as he or she deems necessary or appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, no amendment shall operate to reduce the accrued benefit of any individual who is a Participant at the time the amendment is adopted. 

5.2 Termination - The Plan is purely voluntary and the Board of Directors reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time, provided, however, that the termination shall not operate to reduce the accrued benefit of any individual who is a Participant at the time the Plan is terminated. 

ARTICLE SIX 

General Provisions 

6.1 Source of Payments - The Plan shall not be funded and all payments hereunder to Participants and their Beneficiaries shall be paid from the general assets of the Company. The Company shall not, by virtue of any provisions of the Plan or by any action of any person hereunder, be deemed to be a trustee or other fiduciary of any property for any Participant or his Beneficiaries and the liabilities of the Company to any Participant or his Beneficiaries pursuant to the Plan shall be those of a debtor only pursuant to such contractual obligations as are created by the Plan and no such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of the Company. To the extent that any Participant or his Beneficiaries acquire a right to receive a payment from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. 

6

6.2 No Warranties - Neither the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration nor the Company warrants or represents in any way that the value of each Participant s Account will increase or not decrease. Such Participant assumes all risk in connection with any change in such value. 

6.3 Inalienability of Benefits - No benefit payable under, or interest in, the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge and any attempt to do so shall be void; nor shall any such benefit or interest be in any manner liable for or subject to garnishment, attachment, execution or levy or liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any Participant or his Beneficiaries. In the event that the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration shall find that any Participant or his Beneficiaries has become bankrupt or that any attempt has been made to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any benefit payable under, or interest in, the Plan, the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration shall hold or apply such benefit or interest or any part thereof to or for the benefit of such Participant or his Beneficiaries, his spouse, children, parents or other relatives or any of them. 

6.4 Expenses - The Company shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in operating and administering the Plan, including the expense of any counsel or other specialist engaged by the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration. 

6.5 No Right of Employment - Nothing herein contained nor any action taken under the provisions hereof shall be construed as giving any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliated Company. 

6.6 Limitations on Obligations - Neither the Company, nor any Affiliated Company, nor any officer or employee of either, nor any member of the Board of Directors nor the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration shall be responsible or liable in any manner to any Participant, Beneficiary or any person claiming through them for any action taken or omitted in connection with the granting of benefits or the interpretation and administration of the Plan. 

6.7 Withholding - The Company shall, on its own behalf or on behalf of the Affiliated Companies, withhold from any payment hereunder the required amounts of income and other taxes. 

7

6.8 Headings - The headings of the Sections in the Plan are placed herein for convenience of reference and, in the case of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such heading, shall control. 

6.9 Construction - The Plan shall be construed, regulated and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to the choice of law principles thereof. 

6.10 Payments to Minors, Etc. - Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a minor, an incompetent person or other person incapable of receipting therefor shall be deemed paid when paid to such person s guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person and such payment shall fully discharge the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration, the Company, all Affiliated Companies and all other parties with respect thereto.

ARTICLE ONE 

Scope of Plan and Definitions 

1.1 Purpose and Scope of Plan - The purpose of the Plan (this and other capitalized terms having the meanings set forth below) is to provide benefits to Eligible Employees who participate in the Thrift Plan in excess of those permitted under the Thrift Plan because of the limitations set forth in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code. To the extent that benefits are provided under the Plan, solely because of the limitations set forth in Section 415 of the Code, or because of contributions to a C Account as described herein, the Company intends to maintain the Plan as an excess benefit plan as that term is defined in Section 3(36) of ERISA and Treas. Reg. section 1.409A-2(a)(7)(iii). The rights of each Participant and his Beneficiaries to benefits under the Plan shall be governed by the Plan as set forth herein and as it may hereafter be amended from time to time.

With respect to any other amounts credited to a Participant s account under the Supplemental Thrift Plan, the rights of the Participant and his Beneficiaries shall be governed by the component of the Supplemental Thrift Plan known as the Supplemental Thrift Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) of Union Pacific Corporation, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2009 , as it may hereafter be amended from time to time as permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Prior to January 1, 2009, with respect to all amounts credited under the Supplemental Thrift Plan that were subject to section 409A of the Code, the Supplemental Thrift Plan was administered in good faith compliance with section 409A of the Code. 

1.3 Definitions - As used in the Plan, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context:

2.1 Elective Deferrals and Credits 

(a) An Eligible Employee may, with respect to any Plan Year, elect to make deferrals to be credited under the Plan by filing a Compensation reduction agreement with the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration on such form and at such time in advance as may be prescribed by the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration for such purpose. Such agreement shall authorize the Company or the Affiliated Company by which the Eligible Employee is employed to reduce the Eligible Employee s Compensation by the percentage elected by the Eligible Employee, with such percentage being not less than the minimum deferral percentage permitted under the Thrift Plan and not more than the maximum deferral percentage permitted under the Thrift Plan, commencing as of the date determined pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1) below. The Company shall credit such amount to the Eligible Employee s A Account under the Plan. 

(b) Any election made by an Eligible Employee to defer Compensation made pursuant to paragraph (a) above must be made prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the Eligible Employee performs the services for which the Compensation is payable. An Eligible Employee s election shall remain in effect until the earlier of: 1) when his status as an Eligible Employee ends; or 2) December 31 of the Plan Year to which the election pertains. 

(c) At an Eligible Employee s election, his deferrals under paragraph (a) above shall: 

(1) commence at the earlier of when (A) the Eligible Employee s Compensation for the Plan Year to which such election applies equals the limitation set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code or (B) the percentage of Compensation the Eligible Employee elected to contribute under the Thrift Plan has resulted in annual additions on behalf of the Eligible Employee (including such additions attributable to Matching Contributions and Non-Elective Contributions under the Thrift Plan as in effect on the first day of such Plan Year) equal to the limit set forth in Section 415 of the Code; and 

(2) equal the percentage of the Eligible Employee s Compensation for the period following the commencement date of such deferral determined pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1) above as elected by the Eligible Employee pursuant to paragraph (a) above.

2.4 Supplemental Non-Elective Contribution Credits - Effective January 1, 2018, with respect to an Eligible Employee who is eligible to receive (prior to taking into account the limitations of Sections 5.04 and 2.22(e) of the Thrift Plan) an allocation of Non-Elective Contribution under the terms of the Thrift Plan for a Plan Year and who the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration has designated as eligible to participate in the Plan on or before the last day of such Plan Year, the Company shall credit an Eligible Employee s C Account for a Plan Year with an amount equal to the result of (a) minus (b) where: 

(a) is the annual Non-Elective Contribution for the Plan Year computed as described in and subject to the conditions of Section 4.09 of the Thrift Plan, but determined without regard to the limitation described in Section 5.04 of the Thrift Plan, and including in such computation any amounts of Compensation that were excluded from consideration for the Eligible Employee as a result of the limitation described in Section 2.22(e) of the Thrift Plan; and 

(b) is the Non-Elective Contribution actually determined to be contributed and allocated to the Eligible Employee for such Plan Year under the terms of the Thrift Plan. 

2.5 Timing of Supplemental Non-Elective Contribution Credits - Credit for a Plan Year under Section 2.4 shall be made as of the same date that the Eligible Employee s Non-Elective Contribution is allocated to the Eligible Employee s account under the Thrift Plan for the Plan Year. No credit under Section 2.4 shall be made with respect to a Plan Year in which the Eligible Employee is not eligible to receive (prior to taking into account the limitations of Sections 5.04 and 2.22(e) of the Thrift Plan) an allocation of Non-Elective Contribution under the Thrift Plan. 

2.6 Valuation of Accounts - Pending distribution pursuant to Article Four, the value of amounts credited to a Participant s A, B and C Accounts as of any subsequent date shall be determined by the Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration as follows: 

(a) except as provided in (b) and (c) below, as if such amounts had instead been actually contributed to the Thrift Plan and been invested in accordance with the investment provisions set forth in Article VI (effective August 8, 2007, without regard to Section 6.05A) thereof, provided that investment elections for purposes of the Plan may differ from those made by such Participant under the Thrift Plan; or 

6

(b) except as provided in (c) below, after a Participant s accounts under the Thrift Plan are transferred to another defined contribution plan maintained within the controlled group of corporations of which the Company is the common parent, as if such Accounts had been actual investments transferred to such transferee plan and been invested in accordance with the investment provisions set forth in such transferee plan (effective August 8, 2007, without regard to a provision, if any, in such transferee plan permitting participants in such transferee plan to participate in the Vanguard Advisers Managed Account Program), provided that investment elections for purposes of the Plan may differ from those made by such Participant under such transferee plan; or 

(c) effective May 1, 1991 for a Participant who is subject to the restrictions under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as if such amounts had instead been actually contributed to the Thrift Plan and been invested in accordance with the investment provisions set forth in Article VI (effective August 8, 2007, without regard to Section 6.05A) thereof except that the Participant must make separate investment elections for purposes of this Plan so that no amount will be treated as if it were actually invested in the Company common stock fund and may make other investment elections for purposes of the Plan that differ from those made under the Thrift Plan.

 Scope of Supplemental Plan and Definitions 

1.1 Introduction . This Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component), amended through January 1, 2009, since amended and now further amended effective August 1, 2024 and as it may hereafter be amended from time to time, establishes the rights to specified benefits for certain officers and managers or highly compensated employees who retire or otherwise terminate their Employment on or after January 1, 1989. The rights of any such individual who retired or otherwise terminated Employment prior to January 1, 1989 shall be subject to the terms of the Supplemental Plan as in effect at the date of retirement or termination, except to the extent otherwise provided herein. This Supplemental Plan is intended to be a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan which is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company, pursuant to sections 201, 301 and 401 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA and, as such, to be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA. 

1.2 Applicability . The Supplemental Plan was bifurcated into two components, effective January 1, 2009. As reflected in the terms of this document, one such component is applicable solely to those benefits that were, as of December 31, 2004, both accrued and fully vested in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Plan as in effect on December 31, 2004, which terms were not materially modified after October 3, 2004. The Supplemental Plan benefit governed by the terms of this 409A Grandfathered Component generally is determined by measuring a Participant s accrued benefit as if he had had a Separation from Service on the earlier of the date of his actual Separation from Service or December 31, 2004, and applying the terms of the Supplemental Plan, the Pension Plan and the various applicable Code limits as of that date (except as modified herein). With respect to any other amounts accrued under the Supplemental Plan, the rights of the Participant shall be governed by the component of the Supplemental Plan known as the Supplemental Pension Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component) for Officers and Managers of Union Pacific Corporation and Affiliates, effective January 1, 1989, including all amendments adopted through January 1, 2009 , as it may hereafter be amended from time to time. 

1.3 Definitions . As used in this Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component), the following terms have the meanings set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context: 

(a) Administrator shall have the same meaning as Named Fiduciary Plan Administration as such term is defined in the Pension Plan for Salaried Employees of Union Pacific Corporation and Affiliates. 

(b) Company means Union Pacific and any Affiliated Company which is included in the Supplemental Plan by written action of (i) its board of directors and (ii) either the Board of Directors of Union Pacific or the Administrator acting on behalf of the Board of Directors of Union Pacific; provided, however, that if an Affiliated Company (other than an Affiliated Company that would remain such if the phrase 100 percent were substituted for the phrase at least 80 percent in section 1563(a)(1) of the Code, which is then incorporated by reference in sections 414(b) and (c) of the Code) is included in the Supplemental Plan by virtue of action by the Administrator, unless the Board of Directors of Union Pacific ratifies such action not later than its first regularly scheduled meeting held subsequent to the taking of such action by the Administrator, such Affiliated Company shall cease to be so included as of the close of business on the last day of the month in which such meeting occurs and no employee of such Affiliated Company shall accrue a benefit under the Supplemental Plan.

Effective for benefits starting before July 25, 2002, payments under this subsection (b) were made as described above unless the Administrator advised the Participant and/or Surviving Spouse to the contrary. 

(c) The Surviving Spouse s Pension described in this Section 2.4 is payable in addition to any other death benefit that may be payable to the Surviving Spouse or other beneficiary of the Participant under the form of payment in which the Participant s Supplemental Pension is paid pursuant to Article Three.

2.5 Suspension of Benefits. 

(a) Date of Benefit Suspension . Notwithstanding any provisions of Article Two or Article Four to the contrary, the payment of the pension to which a Participant is otherwise entitled under the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) shall be suspended during any period for which payment of a pension to which such Participant may otherwise be entitled under the Pension Plan is (or would be) suspended under the terms of the Pension Plan due to such Participant s return to Employment. The pension payable to the Participant under the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) which has been suspended shall resume on the same date as payments to the Participant under the Pension Plan resume (or would resume if the Participant had been entitled to such a pension, or the terms of the Pension Plan as in effect on October 3, 2004 applied to the payments to the Participant under the Pension Plan). 

(b) Resumption of Payments . Upon the resumption of payment of such pension hereunder to such Participant, the resumed benefits shall be recalculated taking into account any increases in the Participant s Total Credited Service, Total Offset Service, Incentive Compensation, age and so forth. However, no actuarial or other adjustment shall be made to reflect such suspension. The resumed benefit shall be offset, in a manner prescribed by the Administrator, by (i) any benefit paid during a month in which benefits should have been suspended but were not, which has not previously been repaid to the Company by the Participant, and (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent of any benefits paid prior to Normal Retirement Date. 

10

(c) Form of Resumed Payments . The resumed payments (including any additional benefits earned during the period of suspension on or before December 31, 2004) under the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) shall be paid to the Participant in the same form of payment as the Participant elects for his resumed payments under the Pension Plan.

2.6 Benefits for Special 1990-1992 Window Participants .

(a) the amount that would have been payable to the individual from the Pension Plan for that month, had the provisions of Section 6.12 (prior to 1999, Section 6.11) of the Pension Plan not applied; over 

(b) the amount actually paid to the individual from the Pension Plan for that month. 

2.7 Window Benefits for Highly Compensated Employees . Each Participant who was a Covered Employee under the Pension Plan, who retired under an early retirement window program described in Section 6.06, 6.07 or 6.09 of the Pension Plan but on the relevant date was excluded from participation in the Pension Plan pursuant to Section 3.01(c) of the Pension Plan or was excluded from participation in the window program due to his status as an officer, shall be deemed for all purposes under the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) to have the additional years of service and the additional years of age that would have been credited to the Participant under the Pension Plan pursuant to such program if Section 3.01(c) of the Pension Plan had not applied to the Participant; provided, however, that service credited pursuant to this Section shall not cause the Participant s Total Credited Service or Total Offset Service to exceed 40 years, and no Participant s deemed age shall exceed 65 years.

Effective December 1, 1991, the monthly benefit payment to any person who is (a) a former employee of the Company then receiving retirement benefits under this Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) (regardless of the employee s termination date), or (b) a beneficiary or surviving spouse then receiving death benefits under this Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) shall be increased by the percentage shown in the following table.

4.2 Termination After Vesting . Except as provided in Section 2.11(b)(ii) or 4.4 or Articles Five and Eleven, a Participant not eligible to retire on an Early or Normal Retirement Date on or before December 31, 2004 who is entitled to a benefit under this Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) under Section 4.1 shall be entitled to receive, commencing on the Participant s Normal Retirement Date, the Normal Supplemental Pension computed under Section 2.1 as of the date the Participant terminated Employment or ceased to be a Disabled Participant.

(ii) in the case of a Participant who is credited with additional years of age described in Section 1.3(c)(ii) and, as a result, would be deemed to reach age 55 and become eligible to start his Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefits earlier than his Pension Plan benefits, the first day of the month following the later of (A) the Participant s termination of Employment, or (B) the Participant s 55th birthday (determined taking into account additional years of age described in Section 1.3(c)(ii)); or 

(iii) in the case of a Participant who is not vested under the Pension Plan, the first day of the month following the later of (A) the Participant s termination of Employment, or (B) the Participant s 55th birthday (determined taking into account additional years of age described in Section 1.3(c)(ii)), or the first day of any month thereafter that is prior to the Participant s Normal Retirement Date on which the Participant elects to start payment of his Supplemental Pension. 

27

The election described in (iii) must be made in writing, in a form prescribed by the Administrator, at least six (6) months before, and in the tax year of the Participant immediately preceding, the elected benefit start date. Any Supplemental Pension paid to the Participant commencing prior to Normal Retirement Date shall equal (I) the amount described in Section 2.1(a) adjusted for early payment as of the early benefit start date in accordance with Section 6.04 of the Pension Plan (taking into account any additional years of age described in Section 1.3(c)(ii) for purposes of adjusting both the gross and offset portions of the benefit except as provided otherwise in Section 2.11), reduced by (II) the amount described in Section 2.1(b), if any, adjusted for payment as of the early benefit start date in accordance with Section 6.04 of the Pension Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Participant s Supplemental Pension begins prior to his Pension Plan benefit, the reduction described in (II) shall be calculated and apply beginning on the earliest date benefits are payable to the Participant under the Pension Plan, even if the Participant s Pension Plan benefits do not actually start on that earliest date.

The Participant s Supplemental Pension determined under Section 4.2 shall be adjusted for form of payment, as appropriate, pursuant to Article VIII of the Pension Plan. If, however, such Participant s Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefit starts before his Pension Plan benefit, the Participant s Supplemental Pension will be paid in the form of a single life annuity. 

(b) No Benefits Payable Under Pension Plan . Except as provided in Section 4.4, in the event a Participant is entitled to a benefit from the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) but is not vested in a benefit under the Pension Plan, the Participant shall receive payment of his Supplemental Pension determined under Section 4.2 in the automatic form of payment described in Section 8.02 of the Pension Plan that would have applied to the Participant had he been eligible for and started payment under the Pension Plan on the same day. The Participant s Supplemental Pension determined under Section 4.2 shall be adjusted for form of payment, as appropriate, pursuant to Article VIII of the Pension Plan. 

4.4 Payments Starting Before July 25, 2002 . The rules set forth in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, above, applied to Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefits starting before July 25, 2002, unless the Administrator advised the Participant to the contrary.

(i) any person (or his duly authorized representative) who has applied for and/or received benefits from the Supplemental Plan pursuant to Section 12.1 and who believes that the amount and/or form of benefits provided (including no benefits) or any change in or termination or reduction of benefits previously provided results in a denial of benefits to which he is entitled for any reason (whether under the terms of the Supplemental Plan or by reason of any provision of law); or 

39

(ii) any Employee or other individual (or his duly authorized representative) who believes himself to be entitled to benefits from the Supplemental Plan.

(i) Within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 60 days after a request for review is received, the review shall be made and the claimant shall be advised in writing of the decision on review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the review. If an extension is needed, the claimant shall be given a written notification within such initial 60-day period specifying the reasons for the extension and when such review shall be completed (provided that such review shall be completed within 120 days after the date on which the request for review was filed). However, if the period for deciding the claim has been extended under this paragraph (i) due to a claimant s failure to provide information necessary to decide a claim, the period for making a decision on review shall be tolled from the date the claimant is sent written notice of the extension until the date on which the claimant responds to the request for information (or such earlier date as may be prescribed by the Administrator in accordance with applicable law and regulations).

Notwithstanding any provision of the Supplemental Plan to the contrary, any individual whose Supplemental Plan benefit is recalculated or adjusted in connections with corrections made under the Compliance Statement dated October 25, 2001 (that was issued for the Pension Plan under the Internal Revenue Service Voluntary Compliance Resolution Program) and who believes that such recalculation and/or adjustment results in a denial of benefits to which he is entitled for any reason (whether under the terms of the Supplemental Plan or by reason of any provision of law) may file a claim with the Administrator, in writing, stating the reasons he disagrees with such recalculation and/or adjustment and providing proof of any service, compensation or other facts that he believes should be taken into account. In order to be considered by the Supplemental Plan, such written claim and proof must be received by the Administrator by the date specified in the written notice of such recalculation and/or adjustment that is sent by the Administrator (or his delegate), by first class mail, to the person s address reflected in Supplemental Plan records on the date of the mailing.

Any claim described in this Section 12.4 that is not received by the date specified in the written notice of recalculation and/or adjustment shall be denied on the grounds that it is untimely.

Scope of Supplemental Plan and Definitions 

1.1 Introduction . This Supplemental Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component), amended through January 1, 2009, since amended and now further amended effective August 1, 2024, and as it may hereafter be amended from time to time, establishes the rights to specified benefits for certain officers and managers or highly compensated employees who retire or otherwise terminate their Employment on or after January 1, 2005. The rights of any such individual who retired or otherwise terminated Employment prior to January 1, 2005 shall be subject to the terms of the Supplemental Plan as in effect at the date of retirement or termination, except to the extent otherwise provided herein. This Supplemental Plan is intended to be a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan which is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company, pursuant to sections 201, 301 and 401 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA and, as such, to be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA. 

1.2 Applicability . The Supplemental Plan was bifurcated into two components, effective January 1, 2009. One such component, known as the Supplemental Pension Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) for Officers and Managers of Union Pacific Corporation, effective January 1, 1989 , as it may hereafter be amended from time to time as permitted under section 409A of the Code, is applicable solely to those benefits that were both accrued and fully vested as of December 31, 2004 in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Plan as in effect on December 31, 2004, which terms were not materially modified after October 3, 2004. With respect to all other amounts accrued under the Supplemental Plan, the rights of the Participant shall be governed by the terms of this Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component). 

1.3 Definitions . As used in this Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component), the following terms have the meanings set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context: 

(a) Additional Disability Pay Benefit means the benefit provided for in Section 2.4(b). The Additional Disability Pay Benefit is intended to constitute disability pay that is exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, as described in Section 1.409A 1(a)(5) of the Treasury Regulations. 

(b) Administrator shall have the same meaning as Named Fiduciary-Plan Administration as such term is defined in the Pension Plan for Salaried Employees of Union Pacific Corporation and Affiliates. 

(c) Change in Control means a Change in Control as defined in the Union Pacific Corporation Key Employee Continuity Plan adopted November 16, 2000, as may be amended from time to time. 

(d) Company means Union Pacific and any Affiliated Company which is included in the Supplemental Plan by written action of (i) its board of directors and (ii) either the Board of Directors of Union Pacific or the Administrator acting on behalf of the Board of Directors of Union Pacific; provided, however, that if an Affiliated Company (other than an Affiliated Company that would remain such if the phrase 100 percent were substituted for the phrase at least 80 percent in section 1563(a)(1) of the Code, which is then incorporated by reference in sections 414(b) and (c) of the Code) is included in the Supplemental Plan by virtue of action by the Administrator, unless the Board of Directors of Union Pacific ratifies such action not later than its first regularly scheduled meeting held subsequent to the taking of such action by the Administrator, such Affiliated Company shall cease to be so included as of the close of business on the last day of the month in which such meeting occurs and no employee of such Affiliated Company shall accrue a benefit under the Supplemental Plan.

(f) Early Supplemental Pension means the pension provided for in Section 2.2. 

(g) Effective Date means January 1, 1989, the effective date of this document; provided, however, that when a provision of this Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component) states an effective date other than January 1, 1989, such stated special effective date shall apply as to that provision.

Awards of Incentive Compensation shall be taken into account at the time such awards would have been paid but for the Participant s election, to forego or defer payment under a plan of the Company or an Affiliated Company; provided, however, that for purposes of calculating a Participant s benefit under this Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component) no more than the three highest awards of Incentive Compensation shall be counted in the Participant s highest 36 consecutive months of Compensation determined as of the Participant s Separation from Service taking all Incentive Compensation into account.

(a) Participant Retires on Early Retirement Date . Subject to the provisions of Articles Three, Five and Eleven, a Participant who has a Separation from Service on an Early Retirement Date under the Pension Plan shall receive an Early Supplemental Pension, in the form of a single life annuity commencing on the first day of the month following the later of the Participant s Separation from Service or the Participant s attainment of age 55. The Early Supplemental Pension shall be computed in the same manner as the Normal Supplemental Pension, but with the amounts described in Section 2.1 adjusted for payment as of the early benefit start date in accordance with Section 6.03 of the Pension Plan (whether or not the Participant s Pension Plan benefit or Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefit starts on that date), taking into account any additional years of age described in Section 1.3(e)(ii) solely for purposes of adjusting both the gross and offset portions of the benefit in Section 2.1(a). Additionally, if the Participant s Normal Supplemental Pension, as defined in the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component), is payable under Section 4.2 of such Plan, the Participant s Early Supplemental Pension under the Supplemental Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component) shall be increased by the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of the benefit computed under the immediately preceding sentence attributable to the Participant s Normal Supplemental Pension under the terms of the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) as described in Section 2.1(c) and (ii) such amount that would have been payable from the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) at the Participant s early benefit start date under the Supplemental Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component) (whether or not the Participant s Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefit starts on that date). 

(b) Participant Retires on Early Supplemental Pension Retirement Date . Subject to the provisions of Articles Three, Five and Eleven, a Participant who has a Separation from Service on an Early Supplemental Pension Retirement Date shall receive an Early Supplemental Pension, in the form of a single life annuity commencing on the first day of the month following the later of the Participant s Separation from Service or the Participant s attainment of age 55.

(i) the amount described in Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(c) shall be adjusted for payment as of the early benefit start date in accordance with Section 6.03 of the Pension Plan (whether or not the Participant s Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefit starts on that date), taking into account any additional years of age described in Section 1.3(e)(ii) solely for purposes of adjusting both the gross and offset portions of the benefit in Section 2.1(a); and 

(ii) the amount described in Section 2.1(b) shall be adjusted for payment as of the early benefit start date in accordance with Section 6.04 of the Pension Plan (whether or not the Participant s Pension Plan benefit starts on that date); and 

(iii) if the Participant s Normal Supplemental Pension, as defined in the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component), is payable under Section 4.2 of such Plan, the Participant s Early Supplemental Pension under the Supplemental Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component) shall be increased by the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of the benefit computed under Section 2.2(a) attributable to the Participant s Normal Supplemental Pension under the terms of the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) as described in Section 2.1(c) and (ii) such amount that would have been payable from the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) at the Participant s early benefit start date under the Supplemental Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component) (whether or not the Participant s Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefit starts that date). 

8

2.3 Postponed Supplemental Pension . Subject to the provisions of Articles Three, Five and Eleven, a Participant who has a Separation from Service after his Normal Retirement Age shall be entitled to a Postponed Supplemental Pension, in the form of a single life annuity commencing at the Postponed Retirement Date, which is equal to the Normal Supplemental Pension, computed in accordance with Section 2.1 based on his Total Credited Service, Total Offset Service, etc. as of the Participant s Postponed Retirement Date (instead of his Normal Retirement Date). 

2.4 Disabled Participants . 

(a) Disability Supplemental Retirement Benefit . In the event that a Participant becomes a Disabled Participant under the Pension Plan (and therefore is deemed to have had a Separation from Service under the Pension Plan), the Participant shall receive a Normal Supplemental Pension, Early Supplemental Pension, or Postponed Supplemental Pension, as determined under Section 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 or 4.2, as applicable, in the form of a single life annuity commencing on the first day of the month following the later of the Participant s Disability Date under the Pension Plan or the Participant s attainment of age 55; provided that such Disabled Participant has had a Separation from Service under the Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component). Such benefit shall be based on the Participant s Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component) benefit accrued through his or her Disability Date. 

(b) Additional Disability Pay . To the extent that a Disabled Participant accrues a benefit under this Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component) in excess of the amount described in Section 2.4(a) (due to the continued crediting of service and deemed Compensation for Disabled Participants), such additional benefit shall be paid at the same time and in the same form as the Participant s Pension Plan benefit, as described in Section 6.05 of the Pension Plan. Such Additional Disability Pay Benefit may include, by way of example, any early retirement subsidy with respect to the Supplemental Plan benefit described in Section 2.4(a) that the Disabled Participant accrues after his or her Disability Date. 

2.5 Rehired Employees . The following provisions shall apply to any Participant who returns to Employment with the Company after having had a Separation from Service. 

(a) Any Supplemental Pension determined under the terms of this Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component) that is attributable to a prior period of Employment shall continue to be paid to the Participant without regard to the Participant s reemployment (even if the Participant s Pension Plan benefit and Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefit are suspended during such reemployment). 

(b) A rehired Participant shall be entitled to a Rehire Supplemental Pension, as determined in the same manner as a Supplemental Pension under Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4(a) or 4.2, as applicable, based on the Participant s Final Average Compensation, Incentive Compensation, Total Credited Service and Total Offset Service during his or her aggregated periods of Employment, but offset further by the annual nonforfeitable Supplemental Pension actually determined under the Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component) as of the Participant s prior Separation from Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall not be entitled to accrue a benefit with respect to any period of Employment that follows a rehire occurring on or after January 1, 2018, unless the Participant s Separation from Service was the result of the Participant becoming a Disabled Participant and the Participant returns to Employment as a Covered Employee at such time as the Employer may reasonably require after ceasing to suffer from a Total Disability. 

9

(c) Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.5(b), in the event that the Participant is entitled to receive more than one Rehire Supplemental Pension under this Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component) (as a result of more than two Separations from Service), the provisions of Section 2.5(b) shall be applied as if all prior periods of the Participant s Employment were aggregated into a single prior period of Employment. 

(d) In the event that a Disabled Participant who is entitled to an Additional Disability Pay Benefit under Section 2.4(b) returns to Employment with the Company, the Rehire Supplemental Pension determined under Section 2.5(b) shall not take into account the Additional Disability Pay Benefit (except for purposes of vesting, eligibility for an early retirement subsidy, or the calculation of the 40 year limit in Section 2.1). 

2.6 Surviving Spouse s Pension (Post-Retirement Automatic Survivor Annuity) . 

(a) The Surviving Spouse of a Participant who dies while receiving a Normal Supplemental Pension (including a Normal Supplemental Pension determined under Section 4.2), Postponed Supplemental Pension or an Early Supplemental Pension determined under Section 2.2(a), which death occurs at a time when such Participant was receiving (or was immediately eligible to receive, had the Participant survived), the normal, postponed or early retirement benefit described at Sections 6.01, 6.02 or 6.03, respectively, of the Pension Plan, and, if applicable, an Additional Disability Pay Benefit, shall be entitled to a Surviving Spouse s Pension equal to: 

(i) unless the Participant is described in paragraph (ii) below, one-half of the single life annuity amount of the Normal, Early, or Postponed Supplemental Pension (including the Additional Disability Pay Benefit, if applicable) payable to such deceased Participant under the Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component). 

(ii) if the Participant was receiving, as described in Section 2.4(a), a Normal Supplemental Pension determined under Section 4.2 as a result of becoming a Disabled Participant and incurring a Separation from Service under the Supplemental Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component) prior to attaining age 55, one-half of the single life annuity amount of the Normal, Early or Postponed Supplemental Pension (including the Additional Disability Pay Benefit described in Section 2.4(b), if applicable) credited with respect to such deceased Participant under the terms of the Supplemental Plan (409A Non Grandfathered Component), determined as of the Participant s Benefit Payment Date under the Pension Plan (or date of death if the Participant died prior thereto), and reflecting the Pension Plan s early retirement reduction factors, if applicable, notwithstanding the Participant s Separation from Service prior to age 55 for purposes of the Supplemental Plan (409A Non-Grandfathered Component). 

10

Additionally, if the Participant s Normal Supplemental Pension, as defined in the Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component), is payable under Section 4.2 of such Plan, the Participant s Surviving Spouse s Pension shall be increased by an amount equal to one-half of the amount of the benefit computed under Section 2.1(c) adjusted for payment as of any early benefit start date in accordance with Section 6.04 of the Pension Plan (whether or not the Participant s Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefit starts on that date) and adjusted as of any postponed benefit start date according to any actuarial adjustments for a delay in the commencement of payment of the Participant s benefit beyond the Normal Retirement Date or otherwise that apply to the calculation of such a delayed benefit payment (whether or not the Participant s Supplemental Plan (409A Grandfathered Component) benefit starts on that date). Such Surviving Spouse s Pension shall be payable to such Spouse in equal monthly payments for life, commencing on the first day of the month immediately following the death of such Participant.

(A) When a claim for benefits has been filed by the claimant (or his duly authorized representative), such claim for benefits shall be evaluated and the claimant shall be notified by the Administrator of the approval or denial within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 90 days after the receipt of such claim unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension of time for processing is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period and shall specify the special circumstances requiring an extension and the date by which a final decision will be reached (which date shall not be later than 180 days after the date on which the claim was received).

(b) A Participant may have any Award Account paid to him or, if such Participant is not living at the time of payment, to such Participant s Beneficiaries, in one of the payment options described in subparagraph (b)(1) by making an election of such payment option in accordance with the procedures set forth in subparagraph (b)(2). 

(1) The payment options for any Award Account are described below. 

(i) A single lump sum distribution as provided in subparagraph (a) payable at the earlier of (A) July of the year elected by the Participant or (B) the Participant s Separation from Service. 

(ii) A single lump-sum distribution as provided in subparagraph (a) payable in the year of the Participant s Separation from Service or (if elected by the Participant) January of the next year following such Separation from Service. 

(iii) Annual installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years (such installment period to be elected by the Participant) beginning as soon as administratively practicable following the: (A) Participant s Separation from Service or (B), if elected by the Participant, January of the next year following such Separation from Service, with (under either option) subsequent installments paid in January of each subsequent year, provided that all subsequent installments will be paid in the next succeeding January, with each installment determined by dividing the value of the Participant s then-undistributed Award Account by the number of installments remaining to be made. 

4

(iv) A single lump-sum distribution payable in January of year following the Participant s Separation from Service that is not later than fifteen (15) years after the Participant s Separation from Service, such year to be elected by the Participant. The amount of such distribution shall equal the balance in the Participant s Award Account at such specified date. Pending the lump-sum distribution as aforesaid, the Participant s Award Account shall continue to be invested in accordance with Article Two. If the Award Account relates to amounts deferred into the Plan from the SIP, the increase or decrease in the value of such Award Account shall be accumulated as part of the Award Account and paid as part of such lump-sum distribution. If the Award Account relates to a amounts deferred into this Plan from the EIP, then at the end of each calendar quarter following the Participant s Separation from Service, the net increase or decrease in the value of such Award Account, measured from the first valuation of such Award Account pursuant to Article Two which coincides with or next follows the Participant s Separation from Service, shall be determined. The amount of any such net increase shall be distributed to the Participant within thirty (30) days following the end of such calendar quarter. 

(2) A Participant must elect a payment option described in subparagraph (b)(1) for any Award Account in writing at the time the Participant makes the deferral election that establishes the Award Account, subject to the following restrictions: 

(i) The Participant may always elect the payment option described in subparagraph (b)(1)(i) (providing for payment as of a specified date prior to Separation from Service) with regard to amounts to be deferred to an Award Account, regardless of the payment option the Participant may have elected with respect to any Award Accounts previously established under this Grandfathered Plan. 

(ii) With respect to the payment options described in subparagraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii) or (b)(1)(iv) (each providing for payment following Separation from Service and hereafter referred to as the Separation Payment Options ), the Participant may elect only one such Separation Payment Option with respect to (A) all Award Accounts consisting of amounts deferred into the Plan from the SIP, and (B) all Award Accounts consisting of amounts deferred into the Plan from the EIP (other than, in each case, Award Accounts for which the payment option described in subparagraph (b)(1)(i) has been elected). A Participant s initial election of a Separation Payment Option, with respect to amounts deferred from the SIP or EIP, as the case may be, shall apply to all subsequent deferrals from the SIP or EIP, as applicable, unless the Participant elects the payment option described in subparagraph (b)(1)(i) for such subsequent deferral.

(d) At any time before or after Separation from Service of a Participant who has one or more Award Accounts, the Committee, if it finds in its sole discretion that continued deferral of such Award Account(s) would result in undue hardship to such Participant or his Beneficiary, may accelerate and pay in cash all or any part of such Award Account(s). If payment of part of an Award Account is made pursuant to this Subsection 3.1(d), such payment shall be made pro-rata from the Investment Funds established under Section 2.1 in which such Award Account is invested at the time of the payment. 

(e) In the event of relevant changes in the Federal income tax laws, regulations and rulings, or upon termination of the Plan, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, so accelerate or change the form of payment of any or all Award Accounts.

Scope of Plan and Definitions 

1.1 Purpose and Scope of Plan - The purpose of the Plan (this and other capitalized terms having the meanings set forth below) is to provide a deferral opportunity and related benefits to Eligible Employees who participate in EIP and SIP.

The rights of each Participant and his Beneficiaries to benefits under the Plan shall be governed by the Plan as set forth herein and as it may hereafter be amended from time to time. This Plan was effective January 1, 2009, unless expressly provided otherwise herein, and has since been amended, and is now further amended and restated effective August 1, 2024 as set forth herein. 

1.2 Applicability - The Deferred Compensation Plan was bifurcated into two components, effective January 1, 2009.

Deferrals and Credits 

2.1 Deferrals and Credits 

(a) The Committee may permit an Eligible Employee to elect to make deferrals from Awards (in the case of an Award under SIP that is performance-based compensation, as such term is defined in Code section 409A, after adjustment for dividend equivalent payments in accordance with the terms of the document establishing such Award or, in the case of an Award under EIP, a portion of the EIP Award) to be credited under the Plan by filing an Award deferral agreement with the Committee on such form as may be prescribed by the Committee for such purpose, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time impose in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such agreement must be filed within the period permitted under paragraph (b) below and shall authorize the Company or the Affiliated Company by which the Eligible Employee is employed to reduce the Eligible Employee s Award as elected by the Eligible Employee as of the date determined pursuant to subparagraph (c) below. The Company shall credit such amount to the Eligible Employee s Account under the Plan. 

(b) Any election by an Eligible Employee to defer an Award pursuant to paragraph (a) must be made: 

(1) If the Award is not performance-based compensation as defined under Code section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder, prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the Eligible Employee performs the services for which the Award is payable; and 

(2) If the Award is performance-based compensation, as defined under Code section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder, at least six (6) months prior to the end of the performance period to which the Award relates and before the date as of which such performance-based compensation becomes readily ascertainable, within the meaning of Code section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder, provided, however, that the Eligible Employee is continuously employed from the earlier of the beginning of such performance period or the date the performance goals for such performance period are established through the date of the deferral election. 

(c) An Eligible Employee s deferral under paragraph (a) above shall be made as of the same date that such Award would have been payable to the Eligible Employee under EIP or SIP had such Award not been deferred under the Plan. In the event the Eligible Employee satisfies the requirements for an Award under the EIP but has a Separation from Service before the date the EIP Award would have been paid to the Eligible Employee had such Award not been deferred under the Plan, it shall nevertheless be paid in accordance with such deferral election and the terms of this Plan (including without limitation the Specified Employee Restriction at Section 4.2) with respect to the implementation of such deferral election.

Valuation of Accounts 

3.1 Establishment of Investment Funds - The Committee shall have the authority in its sole discretion to provide a Participant with one or more investment funds for the Participant s Account and to add, delete, consolidate, substitute or otherwise change any such investment funds from time to time as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the investment funds are to be used for measurement purposes only, and a Participant s election of any such investment fund, the allocation of the Participant s Account thereto, the calculation of additional amounts and the crediting or debiting of such amounts to a Participant s Account shall not be considered an actual investment of a Participant s Account in any such investment fund. 

3.2 Transfers Between Investment Funds - Subject to such rules as the Committee may prescribe from time to time in its sole discretion, a Participant may elect to transfer such portion of a Participant s interest in any investment fund as permitted by the Committee to any other available investment fund. Such rules may require that a Participant s Account under this Non-Grandfathered Plan is commingled for investment purposes with any Account a Participant may have in the Union Pacific Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (409A Grandfathered Component). However, separate recordkeeping shall be maintained with respect to the portions of the Participant s benefit in the Deferred Compensation Plan attributable to its Grandfathered and Non-Grandfathered components. 

3.3 Valuation and Accounting - 

(a) Each investment fund shall be valued as such times and in accordance with such method(s) of valuation as determined from time to time in the sole discretion of the Committee, and the value of each Participant s Account shall be determined by reference to the portion of the Participant s Account allocable to each investment fund. The value of each Participant s interest in an investment fund may be measured in units, shares or dollars. 

(b) The value of a Participant s Account shall equal the aggregate value of the investment funds allocable to such Account.

Pending the lump-sum distribution as aforesaid, the Participant s Award Account shall continue to be invested in accordance with Article Three. If the Award Account relates to amounts deferred into this Plan from the SIP, the increase or decrease in the value of such Award Account shall be accumulated as part of the Award Account and paid out as part of such lump sum distribution.

Subject to subparagraph (d)(1)(A), the amount of any such net increase for any calendar quarter shall be distributed to the Participant within thirty (30) days following the end of such calendar quarter.

(3) Notwithstanding the payment date indicated by the form of payment elected thereby, a Participant s modification election to alter the date on which his payments will commence and/or the form in which payment is made must have the effect of postponing the payment commencement date by at least five (5) years, and shall be administered accordingly. A Participant shall be permitted to make a modification election or elections with respect to (i) all of his Award Accounts with respect to amounts deferred from the SIP that are payable at the same time and in the same form; (ii) all of his Award Accounts with respect to amounts deferred from the EIP that are payable at the same time and in the same form, and (iii) fifty percent (50 of the balance as of the applicable payment date of the Award Account(s) attributable to deferrals from the SIP or EIP, as the case may be, that are payable in accordance with subparagraph 4.1(c)(1) in the same year elected by the Participant in accordance with subparagraph 4.1(c)(1), each of which shall be considered a separately identified amount to which the Participant is entitled to payment on a determinable date with the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(i), in accordance within such rules as may be established by the Committee for this purpose consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder. No such modification election shall be permitted if the payment commencement date that was previously elected was more than ten (10) years after the Participant s Separation from Service. 

8

(4) In the case of a Participant who desires to (A) change the method of payment from a single lump-sum distribution to annual installments, or (B) postpone the payment commencement date of annual installments that he previously elected, the maximum number of annual installments shall be fifteen (15), minus the number of years (with a fractional year rounded up to a full year) between the Participant s Separation from Service and the postponed payment commencement date. 

(5) For purposes of this paragraph (d), 

(A) the date as of which payments to a Participant would have commenced, absent the election provided by this paragraph, shall be deemed to be the first possible date as of which such payments could have been made to the Participant; 

(B) the quarterly payment of investment income provided under paragraph (c)(4) above shall be treated as a separate form of payment from the single lump-sum distribution provided by such paragraph; and 

(C) the entitlement to a series of installment payments shall be treated as the entitlement to a single form of payment.

10

(1) 

who has a Separation from Service before the Restriction Period Termination Date as such term is defined in the letter agreement granting such Award, in a single sum as soon as administratively practicable following such Restriction Period Termination Date, but in no event later than the end of the calendar year in which such Restriction Period Termination Date occurs or, if later, ninety (90) days following such Restriction Period Termination Date; or 

(2) 

who has a Separation from Service on or after the Restriction Period Termination Date as such term is defined in the letter agreement granting such Award, in accordance with the payment option set forth in Section 4.1 (c) and elected by the Participant (or in accordance with Section 4.1(a) in the event the Participant fails to make such election); provided, however, that a Participant who has elected the form of payment set forth in Section 4.1(c)(1) shall be paid at the earlier of (i) July of the year selected by the Participant that is after the end of the calendar year in which such Restriction Period Termination Date occurs or (ii) within thirty (30) days of Participant s Separation from Service.

4.3 Additional Restrictions on Payment Options Notwithstanding anything in Section 4.1 to the contrary; except, however the last sentence of subparagraph 4.1(a): 

(a) 

the Participant may always elect the payment option described in subparagraph 4.1(c)(1) (providing for payment as of a specified date prior to Separation from Service) with respect to amounts to be deferred to an Award Account, regardless of the payment options the Participant may have elected with respect to any Award Accounts previously established under this Non-Grandfathered Plan. 

(b) 

with regard to the payment options described in subparagraphs 4.1(c)(2), 4.1(c)(3) or 4.1(c)(4) (each providing for payment following Separation from Service and henceforth referred to as the Separation Payment Options ), the Participant may elect only one such Separation Payment Option with respect to (i) all Award Accounts consisting of amounts deferred into this Plan from the SIP and (ii) all Award Accounts consisting of amounts deferred into this Plan from the EIP (other than, in each case, Award Accounts for which the payment option described in subparagraph 4.1(c)(1) has been elected). A Participant s initial election of a Separation Payment Option, with respect to amounts deferred from the SIP or EIP, as the case may be, shall apply to all subsequent deferrals from the SIP or EIP, as applicable, unless the Participant elects the payment option described in subparagraph 4.1(c)(1) for such subsequent deferral. 

11

(c) 

a Participant s modification election made in accordance with Section 4.1(d) may not change the form of payment of an Award Account from a Separation Payment Option to the form of payment described in subparagraph 4.1(c)(1). In addition, any change to a different Separation Payment Option must apply to all Award Accounts attributable to deferrals from the SIP or EIP, as the case may be, for which a Separation Payment Option has been elected. 

(d) in the event an Award Account is to be paid in accordance with the payment option described in subparagraph 4.1(c)(1) prior to the Participant having a Separation from Service, and at the time of such payment the Company reasonably anticipates that its deduction with respect to the Award Account payable to such Participant would be reduced or eliminated by Code section 162(m), such payment shall be delayed until the Company s first taxable year in which it reasonably anticipates that its deduction of such payment will not be reduced or eliminated by Code Section 162(m), and following such determination will then be paid in a single lump-sum distribution as soon as administratively practicable in such taxable year. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.3(d) to the contrary, this Section 4.3(d) shall apply only to an Award Account attributable to an Award granted on or prior to November 2, 2017 which is not materially modified on or after such date and accordingly, is not subject to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 amendments to Code section 162(m). 

4.4 Responsibility for Payments All payments attributable to credits made hereunder on behalf of a Participant shall be made by the Company on its own behalf or on behalf of the Affiliated Company by who such Participant was employed when such credits were made. Such Affiliated Company shall reimburse the Company for all amounts paid on its behalf.

In addition, the chief human resources officer of Union Pacific Railroad Company or such other officer or employee of Union Pacific Railroad Company or the Company with similar authority, may make (a) all technical, administrative, regulatory and compliance amendments to the Plan or (b) any other amendment to the Plan that will not significantly increase the cost of the Plan to the Company as he or she deems necessary or appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, no amendment shall operate to reduce the accrued benefit of any individual who is a Participant at the time the amendment is adopted. 

6.2 Termination - The Plan is purely voluntary and the Board of Directors reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time, provided, however, that the termination shall not operate to reduce the accrued benefit of any individual who is a Participant at the time the Plan is terminated.

ARTICLE SEVEN 

General Provisions 

7.1 Source of Payments - The Plan shall not be funded and all payments hereunder to Participants and their Beneficiaries shall be paid from the general assets of the Company. The Company shall not, by virtue of any provisions of the Plan or by any action of any person hereunder, be deemed to be a trustee or other fiduciary of any property for any Participant or his Beneficiaries and the liabilities of the Company to any Participant or his Beneficiaries pursuant to the Plan shall be those of a debtor only pursuant to such contractual obligations as are created by the Plan and no such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of the Company. To the extent that any Participant or his Beneficiaries acquire a right to receive a payment from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. 

7.2 No Warranties - Neither the Committee nor the Company warrants or represents in any way that the value of each Participant s Account will increase or not decrease. Such Participant assumes all risk in connection with any change in such value. 

7.3 Inalienability of Benefits - No benefit payable under, or interest in, the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge and any attempt to do so shall be void; nor shall any such benefit or interest be in any manner liable for or subject to garnishment, attachment, execution or levy or liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any Participant or his Beneficiaries. In the event that the Committee shall find that any Participant or his Beneficiaries has become bankrupt or that any attempt has been made to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any benefit payable under, or interest in, the Plan, the Committee shall hold or apply such benefit or interest or any part thereof to or for the benefit of such Participant or his Beneficiaries, his spouse, children, parents or other relatives or any of them. 

7.4 Expenses - The Company shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in operating and administering the Plan, including the expense of any counsel or other specialist engaged by the Committee. 

7.5 No Right of Employment - Nothing herein contained nor any action taken under the provisions hereof shall be construed as giving any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliated Company. 

7.6 Limitations on Obligations - Neither the Company, nor any Affiliated Company, nor any officer or employee of either, nor any member of the Board of Directors nor the Committee shall be responsible or liable in any manner to any Participant, Beneficiary or any person claiming through them for any action taken or omitted in connection with the granting of benefits or the interpretation and administration of the Plan. 

15

7.7 Withholding - The Company shall, on its own behalf or on behalf of the Affiliated Companies, withhold from any payment hereunder the required amounts of income and other taxes. 

7.8 Headings - The headings of the Sections in the Plan are placed herein for convenience of reference and, in the case of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such heading, shall control. 

7.9 Construction - The Plan shall be construed, regulated and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to the choice of law principles thereof. 

7.10 Payments to Minors, Etc. - Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a minor, an incompetent person or other person incapable of receipting therefor shall be deemed paid when paid to such person s guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person and such payment shall fully discharge the Committee, the Company, all Affiliated Companies and all other parties with respect thereto.
