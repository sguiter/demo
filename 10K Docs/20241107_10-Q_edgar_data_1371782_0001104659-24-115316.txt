MV OIL TRUST 

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

Note 1 Organization of the Trust 

MV Oil Trust (the Trust is a statutory
trust formed on August 3, 2006, under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement among MV Partners, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company MV Partners ), as trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the Trustee ), and Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the Delaware Trustee ). 

The Trust was created to acquire and hold a term
net profits interest for the benefit of the Trust unitholders pursuant to a conveyance from MV Partners to the Trust. The term net profits
interest represents the right to receive 80 of the net proceeds (calculated as described below in Note 5) from production from the underlying
properties (as defined below) (the net profits interest ). The net profits interest consists of MV Partners net interests
in all of its oil and natural gas properties located in the Mid-Continent region in the states of Kansas and Colorado (the underlying
properties ). The underlying properties include approximately 850 producing oil and gas wells. 

The
net profits interest is passive in nature, and the Trustee has no management control over and no responsibility relating to the operation
of the underlying properties. The net profits interest entitles the Trust to receive 80 of the net proceeds attributable to MV Partners 
interest from the sale of production from the underlying properties during the term of the Trust. As of September 30, 2024, cumulatively,
since inception, the Trust has received payment for 80 of the net proceeds attributable to MV Partners interest from the sale
of 14.6 million barrels of oil equivalent MMBoe of production from the underlying properties (which amount is the equivalent
of 11.6 MMBoe with respect to the Trust s net profits interest). Consequently, the net profits interest will terminate on June 30,
2026 because the minimum amount of production (14.4 MMBoe) applicable to the net profits interest has been produced and sold (which
amount is the equivalent of 11.5 MMBoe with respect to the Trust s net profits interest). The Trust will wind up
its affairs and terminate after the net profits interest termination date of June 30, 2026 and, once the Trust winds up its affairs
and terminates, it will pay no further distributions. 

The Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow
money to pay administrative or incidental expenses of the Trust that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust
to borrow from the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee as a lender provided the terms of the loan are similar to the terms it would grant
to a similarly situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting
distribution in an account with itself and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. 

Note 2 Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying Statement of Assets and Trust
Corpus as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim financial statements
as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, have been
prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Accordingly, certain
information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been omitted pursuant to those rules and
regulations. 

The preparation of financial statements requires
the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trustee believes such information includes all the disclosures necessary to make
the information presented not misleading. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of the Trustee,
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim period presented. The financial information should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023. 

Note 3 Trust Accounting Policies 

The Trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting
to report receipts of the net profits interest and payments of expenses incurred. The net profits interest represents the right to receive
revenues (oil, gas and natural gas liquid sales) less direct operating expenses (lease operating expenses, lease maintenance, lease overhead,
and production and property taxes) and an adjustment for lease equipment costs and lease development expenses (which are capitalized
in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP )) of the underlying properties times 80 . Actual cash receipts may vary due to timing delays of actual cash receipts from
the property operators or purchasers and due to wellhead and pipeline volume balancing agreements or practices. The actual cash distributions
of the Trust will be made based on the terms of the conveyance that created the Trust s net profits interest. Expenses of the Trust,
which include accounting, engineering, legal and other professional fees, Trustee fees, an administrative fee paid to MV Partners and
out-of-pocket expenses, are recognized when paid. Under U.S. GAAP, revenues and expenses would be recognized on an accrual basis. Amortization
of the investment in net profits interest is recorded on a unit-of-production method in the period in which the cash is received with
respect to such production. Such amortization does not reduce distributable income, rather it is charged directly to Trust corpus. 

2 

This comprehensive basis of accounting other than
U.S. GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,
Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. 

Investment in the net profits interest was recorded
initially at the historical cost of MV Partners and is periodically assessed to determine whether its aggregate value has been impaired
below its total capitalized cost based on the underlying properties. The Trust will provide a write-down to its investment in the net
profits interest if and when total capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization, exceed undiscounted future net revenues attributable
to the proved oil and gas reserves of the underlying properties. 

No new accounting pronouncements were adopted
or issued during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that would impact the financial statements of the Trust. 

Note 4 Investment in Net Profits Interest 

The net profits interest was recorded at the historical
cost of MV Partners on January 24, 2007, the date of conveyance of the net profits interest to the Trust, and was calculated as
follows:

(1) Excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment
 and development costs reflect expenses and costs incurred by MV Partners during the March through
 May production periods for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
 respectively, and during each of the September through May production periods for
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Pursuant to the terms
 of the conveyance of the net profits interest, lease equipment and development costs are
 to be deducted when calculating the distributable income to the Trust. 

(2) Pursuant to the terms of the conveyance of the net profits interest,
 MV Partners can reserve up to 1.0 million for future capital expenditures at any time.
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MV Partners
 did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust. The reserve balance was
 1.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

(3) The income from net profits interest is based upon the cash receipts
 from MV Partners for the oil and gas production. The revenues from oil production are typically
 received by MV Partners one month after production; thus, the cash received by the Trust
 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 substantially represents the production
 by MV Partners from March 2024 through May 2024, and the cash received by the Trust
 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 substantially represents the production
 by MV Partners from March 2023 through May 2023. The cash received by the Trust
 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 substantially represents the production
 by MV Partners from September 2023 through May 2024, and the cash received by the
 Trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 substantially represents the production
 by MV Partners from September 2022 through May 2023. 

3 

For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, MV Purchasing, LLC, which is majority-owned by the indirect equity owners of MV Partners, purchased a majority of the
production from the underlying properties. Sales to MV Purchasing, LLC are under short-term arrangements, ranging from one to six months,
using market-sensitive pricing. 

Note 6 Income Taxes 

The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust and is
not required to pay federal or state income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes has been made. 

Note 7 Distributions to Unitholders 

MV Partners makes quarterly payments of the net
profits interest to the Trust. The Trustee determines for each quarter the amount available for distribution to the Trust unitholders.
This distribution is expected to be made on or before the 25th day of the month following the end of each quarter to the Trust unitholders
of record on the 15th day of the month following the end of each quarter (or the next succeeding business day). Such amounts will be
equal to the excess, if any, of the cash received by the Trust relating to the preceding quarter, over the expenses of the Trust paid
during such quarter, subject to adjustments for changes made by the Trustee during such quarter in any cash reserves established for
future expenses of the Trust. From the first quarter of 2022 to the second quarter of 2023, the Trustee withheld a portion of the proceeds
otherwise available for distribution each quarter to build an approximately 1.265 million cash reserve for the payment of future known,
anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities of the Trust. The Trustee may increase or decrease the targeted amount at any time
and may increase or decrease the rate at which it withholds funds to build the cash reserve at any time, without advance notice to the
unitholders. Cash held in reserve will be invested as required by the Trust Agreement. Any cash reserved in excess of the amount necessary
to pay or provide for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities eventually will be distributed to
unitholders, together with interest earned on the funds. This cash reserve is included in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying
Statements of Assets and Trust Corpus. 

The first quarterly distribution during 2024 was
 5,347,500, or 0.465 per Trust unit, and was made on January 25, 2024 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of January 16,
2024. Such distribution included the net proceeds attributable to the sale of production received by MV Partners from October 1,
2023 through December 31, 2023. 

The second quarterly distribution during 2024
was 3,795,000, or 0.330 per Trust unit, and was made on April 25, 2024 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of April 15,
2024. Such distribution included the net proceeds attributable to the sale of production received by MV Partners from January 1,
2024 through March 31, 2024. 

The third quarterly distribution during 2024 was
 4,715,000, or 0.410 per Trust unit, and was made on July 25, 2024 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of July 15,
2024. Such distribution included the net proceeds attributable to the sale of production received by MV Partners from April 1, 2024
through June 30, 2024. 

The first quarterly distribution during 2023 was
 4,715,000, or 0.410 per Trust unit, and was made on January 25, 2023 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of January 17,
2023. Such distribution included the net proceeds attributable to the sale of production received by MV Partners from October 1,
2022 through December 31, 2022. The Trustee withheld 263,541 from the net proceeds otherwise available for distribution towards
the building of the cash reserve described above. 

The second quarterly distribution during 2023
was 3,967,500, or 0.345 per Trust unit, and was made on April 25, 2023 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of April 17,
2023. Such distribution included the net proceeds attributable to the sale of production received by MV Partners from January 1,
2023 through March 31, 2023. The Trustee withheld 263,540 from the net proceeds otherwise available for distribution towards the
building of the cash reserve described above and with that amount, the targeted reserve was fully funded. 

4 

The third quarterly distribution during 2023 was
 3,737,500, or 0.325 per Trust unit, and was made on July 25, 2023 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of July 17,
2023. Such distribution included the net proceeds attributable to the sale of production received by MV Partners from April 1, 2023
through June 30, 2023. 

Note 8 Advance for Trust Expenses 

Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee
is allowed to borrow money to pay Trust expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no borrowings
or amounts owed for money borrowed in previous quarters. MV Partners has provided a letter of credit in the amount of 1.8 million to
the Trustee to protect the Trust against the risk that it does not have sufficient cash to pay future expenses. 

Note 9 Subsequent Events 

The fourth quarterly distribution during 2024
was 3,795,000, or 0.330 per Trust unit, and was made on October 25, 2024 to Trust unitholders owning Trust units as of October 15,
2024. Such distribution included the net proceeds attributable to the sale of production received by MV Partners from July 1, 2024
through September 30, 2024. 

Item 2. Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion of the Trust s
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto. The Trust s
purpose is, in general, to hold the net profits interest, to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect
of the net profits interest, and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the net profits interest and the Trust units.
The Trust derives substantially all of its income and cash flows from the net profits interest. All information regarding operations
has been provided to the Trustee by MV Partners. 

Overview and Trust Termination 

The Trust does not conduct any operations or activities.
The net profits interest is passive in nature, and the Trustee has no management control over and no responsibility relating to the operation
of the underlying properties. The Trust s purpose is, in general, to hold the net profits interest, to distribute to the Trust
unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the net profits interest, and to perform certain administrative functions in respect
of the net profits interest and the Trust units. The Trust derives substantially all of its income and cash flows from the net profits
interest. The net profits interest entitles the Trust to receive 80 of the net proceeds attributable to MV Partners interest

Trust
termination. The Trust will wind up its affairs and terminate after the net profits interest termination date, which is set
at June 30, 2026. 

Results of Operations 

Results of Operations for the Quarters Ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 

The cash received by the Trust from MV Partners
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from March 2024 through
May 2024. The cash received by the Trust from MV Partners during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 substantially represents
the production by MV Partners from March 2023 through May 2023. The revenues from oil production are typically received by
MV Partners one month after production. The Trust s income from net profits interest before reserve adjustments increased 1,009,906
to 4,949,064 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 3,939,158 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase
was primarily due to a 1,262,382 increase in excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs
for the underlying properties to 6,186,330 from 4,923,948 for the same period in the prior year. These amounts were reduced by a Trustee
holdback for current Trust expenses of 234,064 and 201,658 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Trustee paid
general and administrative expenses of 235,404 and 143,670 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During
the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MV Partners did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust
from the previously established reserve for future capital expenditures. These factors resulted in distributable income for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 of 4,715,000, an increase of 977,500 from 3,737,500 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

was 3.58 per Mcf for the period from April 1, 2023 through June 30, 2023. 

The overall production sales volumes attributable
to the net profits interest for the oil and gas production collected during the period from April 1, 2024 through June 30,
2024 were 119,962 Bbls of oil and 5,697 Mcf of natural gas, for a total of 120,912 barrels of oil equivalent. The overall production
sales volumes attributable to the net profits interest for the oil and gas production collected during the period from April 1,
2023 through June 30, 2023 were 122,936 Bbls of oil, 5,874 Mcf of natural gas and 6 Bbls of natural gas liquids, for a total of
123,919 barrels of oil equivalent. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 

The cash received by the Trust from MV Partners
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 substantially represents the production by MV Partners from September 2023
through May 2024. The cash received by the Trust from MV Partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 substantially
represents the production by MV Partners from September 2022 through May 2023. The revenues from oil production are typically
received by MV Partners one month after production. The Trust s income from net profits interest increased 1,012,524 to 14,527,482
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13,514,958 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was
primarily due to a 1,265,654 increase in excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs
for the underlying properties to 18,159,352 from 16,893,698 for the same period in the prior year. These amounts were reduced by a
Trustee holdback for current Trust expenses of 669,982 and 567,877 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and a Trustee holdback for future Trust expenses of 527,081 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Trustee paid general
and administrative expenses of 676,320 and 718,509 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MV Partners did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust from
the previously established reserve for future capital expenditures. These factors resulted in distributable income for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 of 13,857,500, an increase of 1,437,500 from 12,420,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. 

The average price received for crude oil sold
was 75.90 per Bbl and the average price received for natural gas sold was 2.31 per Mcf for the period from October 1, 2023 through
June 30, 2024. The average price received for crude oil sold was 74.72 per Bbl and the average price received for natural gas sold
was 5.22 per Mcf for the period from October 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023. 

The overall production sales volumes attributable
to the net profits interest for the oil and gas production collected during the period from October 1, 2023 through June 30,
2024 were 358,874 Bbls of oil, 17,212 Mcf of natural gas and 11 Bbls of natural gas liquids, for a total of 361,750 barrels of oil
equivalent. The overall production sales volumes attributable to the net profits interest for the oil and gas production collected during
the period from October 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 were 364,606 Bbls of oil, 18,492 Mcf of natural gas and 50 Bbls
of natural gas liquids, for a total of 367,721 barrels of oil equivalent. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Other than Trust administrative expenses, including
any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities, the Trust s only use of cash is for distributions to Trust unitholders.
Administrative expenses include payments to the Trustee as well as an annual administrative fee to MV Partners pursuant to an administrative
services agreement. Each quarter, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution. Available funds are the excess
cash, if any, received by the Trust from the net profits interest and payments from other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts
reserved by the Trustee) in that quarter, over the Trust s expenses paid for that quarter. Available funds are reduced by any cash
the Trustee decides to hold as a reserve against future expenses. 

From the first quarter of 2022 to the second quarter
of 2023, the Trustee withheld a portion of the proceeds otherwise available for distribution each quarter to build an approximately 1.265
million cash reserve for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities. This amount is in addition to
the 1.8 million letter of credit described below. The Trustee may increase or decrease the targeted amount at any time and may increase
or decrease the rate at which it withholds funds to build the cash reserve at any time, without advance notice to the unitholders. Cash
held in reserve will be invested as required by the Trust Agreement. Any cash reserved in excess of the amount necessary to pay or provide
for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities eventually will be distributed to unitholders, together
with interest earned on the funds. As of September 30, 2024, 1,257,594 was held by the Trustee and is reported as cash and cash
equivalents. 

6 

The Trustee may cause the Trust to borrow funds
required to pay expenses if the Trustee determines that the cash on hand and the cash to be received are insufficient to cover the Trust s
expenses. If the Trust borrows funds, the Trust unitholders will not receive distributions until the borrowed funds are repaid. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no such borrowings. MV Partners has provided a letter of
credit in the amount of 1.8 million to the Trustee to protect the Trust against the risk that it does not have sufficient cash to pay
future expenses. 

Income to the Trust from the net profits interest
is based on the calculation and definitions of gross proceeds and net proceeds contained in the conveyance. 

As substantially all of the underlying properties
are located in mature fields, MV Partners does not expect future costs for the underlying properties to change significantly as compared
to recent historical costs other than changes due to fluctuations in the general cost of oilfield services. MV Partners may establish
a capital reserve of up to 1.0 million in the aggregate at any given time to reduce the impact on distributions of uneven capital
expenditure timing. As of September 30, 2024, 1.0 million was held by MV Partners as a capital reserve. 

The Trust does not have any transactions, arrangements
or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the Trust s liquidity or the availability
of capital resources. 

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Form 10-Q includes forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical fact included in
this Form 10-Q, including without limitation the statements under Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements. Although MV Partners advised the Trust that it believes that the expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, such expectations may not prove to have been correct. Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations Cautionary Statements are disclosed in
this Form 10-Q and in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ),
including under the sections Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II
of this Form 10-Q. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Trust or persons acting on its
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the Cautionary Statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

The Trust is a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information under this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Trustee maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls
and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust is accumulated
and communicated by MV Partners to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee of the Trust, and its employees who participate
in the preparation of the Trust s periodic reports as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered by this report,
the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures. A Trust Officer of the Trustee has concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust are effective. 

7 

Due to the contractual arrangements of (i) the
Trust Agreement and (ii) the conveyance of the net profits interest, the Trustee relies on (A) information provided by MV Partners,
including historical operating data, plans for future operating and capital expenditures, reserve information and information relating
to projected production, and (B) conclusions and reports regarding reserves by the Trust s independent reserve engineers.
See Risk Factors The Trust and the public Trust unitholders have no voting or managerial rights with respect to MV Partners,
the operator of the underlying properties. As a result, public Trust unitholders have no ability to influence the operation of the underlying
properties and Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Form 10-K
for a description of certain risks relating to these arrangements and reliance on information when reported by MV Partners to the Trustee
and recorded in the Trust s results of operations. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in
the Trust s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. The Trustee notes for purposes of clarification that it has no authority
over, and makes no statement concerning, the internal control over financial reporting of MV Partners.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

There have not been any material changes from
the risk factors previously disclosed in the Trust s response to Item 1A to Part I of the Form 10-K, other than
as set forth below. 

The market price for the Trust units may not reflect the value
of the net profits interest held by the Trust and, in addition, over time will decline to zero around or shortly after the termination
date of the net profits interest, June 30, 2026. 

The trading price for publicly traded securities
similar to the Trust units tends to be tied to recent and expected levels of cash distributions. The amounts available for distribution
by the Trust will vary in response to numerous factors outside the control of the Trust, including prevailing sales prices of oil, natural
gas and natural gas liquids production attributable to the underlying properties. Further, the market price of Trust units may be affected
by factors other than the anticipated future Trust distributions. Consequently, the market price for the Trust units may not necessarily
be indicative of the value that the Trust would realize if it sold the net profits interest to a third-party buyer. In addition, such
market price may not necessarily reflect the fact that since the assets of the Trust are depleting assets, a portion of each cash distribution
paid, if any, on the Trust units should be considered by investors as a return of capital, with the remainder, if any, being considered
as a return on investment. As a result, distributions made to a Trust unitholder over the life of these depleting assets may not equal
or exceed the purchase price paid by the unitholder, and over time the market price of the Trust units will decline to zero around or
shortly after the net profits interest termination date of June 30, 2026. After the net profits interest termination date of June 30,
2026, it is anticipated that the Trustee will make a final quarterly cash distribution, if any, shortly after the termination date to
the Trust unitholders of record on the 15th day following June 30, 2026. If the Trust units are trading at a price substantially
in excess of the aggregate distributions that may reasonably be expected to be made prior to the termination of the Trust, the price
decline is likely to include one or more abrupt substantial decreases. 

The Trustee may, under certain circumstances, sell the net profits
interest and dissolve the Trust prior to the expected termination of the Trust. As a result, Trust unitholders may not recover their
investment. 

The Trustee must sell the net profits interest
if the holders of a majority of the Trust units approve the sale or vote to dissolve the Trust. The Trustee must also sell the net profits
interest if the annual cash proceeds from the underlying properties attributable to the net profits interest are less than 1.0 million
for each of any two consecutive years. The sale of the net profits interest will result in the dissolution of the Trust. The net proceeds
of any such sale will be distributed to the Trust unitholders; however, Trust unitholders may not recover their investment in the Trust
units. 

The Trust will wind up its affairs and terminate
shortly after June 30, 2026. After the net profits interest termination date of June 30, 2026, it is anticipated that the Trustee
will make a final quarterly cash distribution, if any, shortly after the termination date to the Trust unitholders of record on the 15th
day following June 30, 2026. Other than such potential payment, the Trust unitholders will not be entitled to receive any net proceeds
from the sale of production from the underlying properties following the termination of the net profits interest. Therefore, the market
price of the Trust units will approach and eventually reach zero shortly after the end of the net profits interest term because cash
distributions from the Trust will cease following the termination of the net profits interest, and the Trust will have no right to any
additional production from the underlying properties after the term of the net profits interest. 

Item 5. Other Information. 

Rule 10b5-1
Trading Plans. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no officer or employee of the Trustee who performs policy-making
functions for the Trust adopted, modified, or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,
as such terms are defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, with respect to the Trust units.
