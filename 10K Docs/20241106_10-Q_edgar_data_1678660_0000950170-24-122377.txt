 NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTER IM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million at September 30, 2024. The Company has no product revenue to-date and devotes its efforts to research and development. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales of its product candidates currently in development. The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. To fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements after that date, the Company plans to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into strategic alliances or other arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company s stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, it could be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects.

securities with a total fair market value of million in an unrealized loss position. The Company believes any unrealized losses associated with the decline in value of its securities is temporary and is primarily related to market factors. Furthermore, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will be able to hold its marketable securities to maturity. Therefore, the Company anticipates a full recovery of the amortized cost basis of its marketable securities at maturity and an allowance for credit losses was not recognized.

Unless required by law, there shall be no cumulative voting. Any holder of non-voting common stock may elect to convert each share of non-voting common stock into one fully paid and non-assessable share of voting common stock at any time by providing written notice to the Company; provided that as a result of such conversion, such holder, together with its affiliates and any members of a Schedule 13(d) group with such holder, would not beneficially own in excess of of the Company s common stock immediately prior to and following such conversion, unless otherwise as expressly provided for in the Company s restated certificate of incorporation. However, this ownership limitation may be increased (not to exceed or decreased to any other percentage designated by such holder of non-voting common stock upon 61 days notice to the Company. Shelf Registration Statements In November 2021, the Company filed a shelf registration statement (the "2021 Shelf Registration Statement") which permits the offering of up to million aggregate dollar amount of shares of our common stock or preferred stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities and/or units consisting of some or all of these securities, in one or more offerings and in any combination. The 2021 Shelf Registration Statement expires on , and as of September 30, 2024 , there was million remaining under the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement. In May 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement (the "2024 Shelf Registration Statement") with the SEC for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units up to an aggregate amount of million. The 2024 Shelf Registration statement was declared effective on June 10, 2024. The 2024 Shelf Registration statement expires in , and as of September 30, 2024 , there was million remaining under the 2024 Shelf Registration statement. Open Market Sales Agreement In March 2023, in connection with filing a prospectus supplement to its 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, the Company entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with Jefferies LLC, as the sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering amount of up to million. The million of common stock that may be issued and sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement is included in the million of securities that may be issued and sold pursuant to the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement. The Company will pay Jefferies LLC a commission rate of up to of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. At September 30, 2024 , there was million remaining under the Sales Agreement. 2023 Financings During the second quarter of 2023, the Company sold shares of its common stock which comprised of (i) shares of its voting common stock and (ii) shares of its non-voting common stock at a price of per share and to certain investors in lieu of common stock, the Company sold pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of voting common stock at a price of per pre-funded warrant, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of million. Of the voting common stock issued, shares were purchased by the Company s underwriters in connection with a 30-day option at a price of per share. Offering costs of million, of which million were previously paid and deferred, were recorded to additional paid-in capital in the accompanying balance sheets, resulting in net proceeds of million. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company sold in a private placement pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of voting common stock at a price of per pre-funded warrant, resulting in net proceeds of million after deducting offering costs of million. The purchase price per share of each pre-funded warrant represents the per share offering price for the common stock, minus the per share exercise price of such pre-funded warrant. As of September 30, 2024 , pre-funded warrants had been exercised. The pre-funded warrants were classified as a component of permanent stockholders equity within additional paid-in capital and were recorded at the issuance date using a relative fair value allocation method. The pre-funded warrants are equity classified because they (i) are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the equity instruments, (ii) are immediately exercisable, (iii) do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, (iv) permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise, (v) are indexed to the Company s common stock and (vi) meet the equity classification criteria. In addition, such pre-funded warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The Company did not conduct any financings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

rentable square feet and has an initial term of months with extension options and certain expansion rights. Neither the option to extend nor the expansion rights were recognized as part of the Company's measurement of the right-of-use ("ROU") asset and operating lease liability as of September 30, 2024. Under the terms of the Chestnut Run Lease, the landlord provided an allowance towards the cost of completing tenant improvements for the premises. The Company concluded that the improvements resulting from both the landlord's build-out and the tenant improvements are the landlord's assets for accounting purposes. Costs incurred by the Company related to tenant improvements in excess of the landlord's allowance were treated as prepaid rent and increased the right-of-use asset on the commencement date. In April 2024, the Company entered into a 12 month finance lease for equipment. Our operating lease costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively. Our operating lease costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively.

Lease liability 

The Company paid a security deposit for the Chestnut Run Lease in the form of a letter of credit of million, which is included in the accompanying balance sheet as restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 . The security deposit may be reduced to million over time in accordance with the terms of the Chestnut Run Lease. In connection with the Company s expansion of operations in the State of Delaware, the Company was approved for a grant from the State of Delaware in 2021 that will provide up to million in reimbursements over for the development of lab space and up to million to increase jobs in Delaware to meet specific targeted levels through , which was extended to during the second quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company was approved for an additional grant from the State of Delaware for the development of lab space in the amount of million. In 2022, the Company received cash grants of million from the State of Delaware for the development of lab space. The Company has met the minimum requirements stated in the grant agreement in order to not be required to pay back any portion of the million disbursed. The Company deferred the recognition of these grant funds as they relate to capitalized costs and has classified them as long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. The Company recognizes the grant funds in other income as grant income over the length of the lease term. Additionally, if the Company leaves the State of Delaware within five years of the disbursement, the Company is required to return an amount equal to the amount of grant funds disbursed on a pro-rated basis. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has received million for increasing jobs since the date the grant was approved, which has been recorded in other income. Employment Agreements The Company entered into employment agreements with key personnel providing for compensation and severance in certain circumstances, as defined in the respective employment agreements. 401(k) Defined Contribution Plan The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering all employees. Participants are permitted to contribute up to of their eligible annual pretax compensation up to an established federal limit on aggregate participant contributions. The Company provides a match of a maximum amount of of the participant s compensation. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made matching contributions of million and million, respectively. For nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made matching contributions of million and million, respectively. Research Collaboration Agreement In 2023, the Company entered into a multi-year, multi-program agreement with AbCellera Biologics Incorporated ("AbCellera") to jointly discover, develop, and commercialize novel oncology medicines for up to five programs. Under the terms of the agreement, AbCellera will lead manufacturing activities and the Company will lead clinical development and global commercialization, subject to AbCellera s option to co-promote any resulting commercial products in the United States. If, at any point one party in the collaboration opts-out of future co-development cost sharing, that party will be entitled to a royalty from commercialization of the collaboration target, dependent on the proportion of their co-development contributions compared to the total development costs of a target as defined within the agreement. The Company concluded that the agreement with AbCellera will be accounted for under the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, as both parties will actively participate in joint operating activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. Under ASC 808, certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should follow the accounting for revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when the collaborative arrangement participant is a customer for a distinct good or service. The Company determined that co-development arrangement as defined in our agreement with AbCellera does not meet the definition of a customer as defined by ASC 606. As a result, these activities will be accounted for as 

 14 

million upfront, non-refundable payment. The agreement also includes a near term million payment upon the earlier of 180 days following the effective date of the license agreement or the execution of a quality agreement between the parties pursuant to which the Company will transfer title to certain quantities of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient API ). In addition, the Company may receive potential developmental milestone payments up to million, potential sales milestone payments up to million and a range of high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on PRT811 global net sales. The Company assessed the license agreement with Pathos in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customer, and concluded that Pathos is a customer. The license agreement with Pathos includes the transfer of the following goods or services: (i) exclusive license to PRT811, (ii) transfer of licensed know-how and materials (i.e. datasets, regulatory and manufacturing documents, etc.), (iii) participation in a Joint Communication Committee ("JCC"), and (iv) execution of a quality agreement pursuant to which the Company will transfer title to certain API. The Company evaluated all of the promised goods or services within the contract and determined which goods and services were separate performance obligations. The Company determined that Pathos could not benefit from the license separately from the related know-how and materials, accordingly they represent one combined performance obligation. The execution of a quality agreement pursuant to which the Company will transfer title to certain API was identified as a separate performance obligation. The Company also determined the participation in the JCC is immaterial in the context of the license agreement as the Company has no decision-making ability through its participation in the JCC. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation based upon relative standalone selling prices, which were estimated for (i) the exclusive license and know-how and materials at million using an adjusted market approach and (ii) execution of a quality agreement pursuant to which the Company will transfer title to certain API at million using a cost plus margin approach. With respect to the accounting principles identified above, each performance obligation will be recognized at a point in time. The Company determined that the performance obligation for the license and transfer of related know-how and materials would be fully satisfied when the license is granted and key know-how and materials are transferred to Pathos as that is the point at which Pathos can fully use and benefit from the license to PRT811. The performance obligation for the execution of a quality agreement pursuant to which the Company will transfer title to certain API will be satisfied when the legal title to the API is transferred. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company satisfied the performance obligation related to the exclusive license and transfer of related know-how and materials which resulted in the recognition of revenue for million previously deferred. The Company will recognize revenue of million in the fourth quarter of 2024 as t he performance obligation for the execution of the quality agreement pursuant to which the Company transferred title to certain API was completed in early October 2024. Other Research and Development Arrangements The Company enters into agreements with clinical research organizations ("CROs") to assist in the performance of research and development activities. Expenditures to CROs represent a significant cost in clinical development for the Company. 

 equity incentive plans: the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan.

 Overview 
 Prelude is a clinical-stage fully integrated oncology company built on a foundation of drug discovery excellence to deliver novel precision cancer medicines to underserved patients. By leveraging our core competencies in cancer biology and medicinal chemistry, combined with our clinical development capabilities, we have built an efficient, fully-integrated drug discovery engine and the development expertise necessary to identify compelling biological targets and create new chemical entities, or NCEs, that we advance into clinical trials. We believe our approach could result in better targeted cancer therapies. Our discovery excellence has been validated by our steady progress in creating a wholly-owned, internally developed pipeline. We also began work with our partner AbCellera on an early-stage discovery program involving potent degraders as payloads for novel antibodies targeting tumor specific antigens. Since our inception in 2016, we have received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for multiple investigational new drug applications, or INDs, and successfully advanced several programs into clinical trials. In addition, we have other differentiated proprietary programs in various stages of preclinical development. 
 By focusing on developing molecules using broad mechanisms that have multiple links to oncogenic driver pathways in select patients, we have developed a diverse pipeline consisting of multiple distinct programs including kinases, targeted protein degraders, and precision antibody drug conjugates. Our pipeline is designed to serve patients with high unmet medical need, where there are limited or no treatment options. We believe we can best address these diseases by developing therapies that target primary and secondary resistance mechanisms. 
 We have several drug candidates in clinical development and our objective is to generate proof-of-concept clinical data to guide our future regulatory pathways to approval. Our SMARCA2 molecule is a unique, first-in-class protein degrader, targeting specific patient populations. Our CDK9 inhibitor is selective and potent, with a potentially superior safety profile over first-generation CDK9 inhibitors. 
 Our novel, first-in-class SMARCA2 degrader compounds and our potent, highly selective and potentially best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor represent our best opportunities for demonstrating clinical proof-of-concept in 2024 and advancing into potential Phase 2/3 registration studies. In 2023, we announced a global partnership with AbCellera Biologics Incorporated ("AbCellera") that will allow us to combine our small molecules and degraders expertise with their antibody expertise to develop precision antibody drug conjugates. We also intend to explore continued clinical development with external partners for our CDK4/6 inhibitor. 
 PRT3789 is a first-in-class, highly selective degrader of SMARCA2 protein, which along with SMARCA4 controls gene regulation through chromatin remodeling. Cancer cells with SMARCA4 mutations are dependent on SMARCA2 for their growth and survival and selectively degrading SMARCA2 induces cell death in cancer cells while sparing normal cells in preclinical models. PRT3789 has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in multiple preclinical models of SMARCA4 deleted/mutated cancers as monotherapy and in combination with standards of care therapies. We believe a selective SMARCA2 degrader has the potential to be of benefit in up to 10 of non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, patients in the United States including many other tumor types with the SMARCA4 mutation. 
 18 

Patients with SMARCA4 mutated cancer have a poor prognosis. This represents an area of high unmet medical need. Therefore, mutated or deleted SMARCA4 cancers provide a potential biomarker to select those patients most likely to respond to treatment with a highly selective SMARCA2 degrader. 
 PRT3789 is currently in Phase 1 clinical development in patients with biomarker selected SMARCA4 mutated cancers. Objectives for this first Phase 1 clinical trial are to establish the safety and tolerability profile of PRT3789 as both monotherapy and in combination with docetaxel, evaluate activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and determine a dose and potential indications for advancement into a registrational clinical trial. We presented the first interim clinical data updates of the Phase 1 dose escalation study at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024 and the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium. As reported by investigators, PRT3789 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses tested to date. Of the 26 advanced NSCLC or esophageal patients with Class 1 (loss of function) mutations who were evaluable for efficacy, RECIST confirmed partial responses (PRs) were observed in 4 patients (2 esophageal, 2 NSCLC). Of the 9 patients with Class 1 mutations treated at doses of 283 mg or higher, two had RECIST confirmed partial responses and both were NSCLC patients. Tumor shrinkage was observed in patients with both Class 1 and Class 2 SMARCA4 mutations. Additional patients on-study demonstrated clinical benefit as measured by prolonged SD, including one advanced NSCLC patient who remains stable and on study having been treated for more than a year. Initial observations of safety from evaluable patients in the PRT3789 plus docetaxel combination dose escalation arm of the trial were also presented. To date, PRT3789 in combination with docetaxel demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with no dose limiting toxicities or study drug serious adverse events reported. 
 Enrollment remains on track, and the Company expects to conclude monotherapy dose escalation by year end 2024 and identify a dose for advancement to registrational trials. In addition, enrollment of patients into back-fill cohorts enriched for NSCLC and SMARCA4 loss-of-function mutations is ongoing, as is enrollment of the combination with docetaxel cohort. 
 The Company also initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating PRT3789 in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with SMARCA4-mutated cancers, per the previously announced collaboration with Merck. 
 Our discovery team has identified a series of highly selective and orally bioavailable SMARCA2 degraders. In July 2024, we received IND clearance for the lead oral molecule, PRT7732. The Company initiated and enrolled our first patients in a phase 1 multi-dose escalation trial of PRT7732 (NCT06560645) in biomarker selected SMARCA4 mutated cancers. 
 As one of our first precision ADC programs, we and our partner AbCellera began work on an early-stage discovery program involving potent degraders of the SMARCA family of proteins as payloads for novel antibodies targeting tumor specific antigens. Given the potent anti-tumor activity of these molecules in pre-clinical models of cancers beyond those targeted by our SMARCA2 selective degraders, we believe that these precision ADCs have the potential to extend the therapeutic utility of this class. The partnership includes up to five precision ADC targets. Under the terms of the agreement, we and AbCellera will jointly discover, develop, and commercialize products emerging from the collaboration. AbCellera will lead manufacturing activities and we will lead clinical development and global commercialization, subject to AbCellera s option to co-promote any resulting commercial products in the United States. 
 The Company presented the first preclinical data from its precision ADC platform at the 36 th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium in October 2024. The data demonstrated potent activity of a SMARCA 2/4 degrader payload when conjugated to a range of commercially available antibodies, including PSMA, TROP2, C-MET, CEACAM5, and CD33. The SMARCA2/4 degrader payload conjugated to an anti-PSMA antibody demonstrated tumor regressions and significantly better in vivo efficacy compared to a traditional PSMA-targeted cytotoxic ADC in xenograft models of prostate cancer at well tolerated doses. 
 Our CDK9 candidate, PRT2527, is designed to be a potent and selective CDK9 inhibitor. We believe PRT2527 has the potential to avoid off-target toxicities, achieve substantial clinical activity and to become the best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor for hematologic malignancies. 
 In preclinical studies, PRT2527 was shown to reduce MCL1 and MYC protein levels and was highly active in preclinical models at well-tolerated doses. Our preclinical studies suggest that PRT2527 demonstrates high kinase selectivity and potency, providing opportunity for a wider therapeutic index compared to less selective CDK9 inhibitors, allowing for rapid development in combinations. Preclinical data demonstrated that treatment with PRT2527 depleted oncogenic drivers with short half-lives, such as MYC and MCL1, and effectively induced apoptosis. PRT2527 treatment demonstrated robust efficacy in both hematological malignancies and solid tumor models with MYC dysregulation. Dose dependent increases in exposure and target engagement were observed as evidenced by MYC and MCL1 depletion to levels associated with tumor regression in preclinical models. 
 PRT2527 has completed a Phase 1 multi-dose escalation study (NCT05159518) in patients with solid tumors. In this study, PRT2527 was shown to achieve high levels of target inhibition and the potential to be better tolerated than existing CDK9 inhibitors, specifically, managing neutropenia and an absence of meaningful gastrointestinal events or hepatotoxicity. 
 The observed dose-dependent downregulation of MYC and MCL1 mRNA expression, CDK9 transcriptional targets, was consistent with the degree of target engagement required for preclinical efficacy. As predicted by the preclinical models, 12 mg/m2 QW dosing showed optimal target inhibition and has been selected as the optimal dose. The overall safety profile observed in this 
 19 

study supports further development of PRT2527 in hematologic malignancies (NCT05665530). In this study, PRT2527 is advancing as monotherapy in both lymphoid and myeloid hematological malignancies and we have initiated the combination with zanubrutinib in B-cell malignancies. We expect to complete the monotherapy dose escalation in B-cell malignancies in 2024. Initiation of dose escalation in myeloid malignancies occurred in the first half of 2024. Interim phase 1 clinical data with potentially best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor, PRT2527 in hematological malignancies will be presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2024. 
 As discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, last fiscal year, after concluding Phase 1 development of PRT1419, we decided to discontinue development of PRT1419 in order to prioritize our CDK9 inhibitor, PRT2527. 
 PRT3645 is a brain and tissue penetrant molecule that potently targets CDK4/6 with a biased selectivity for CDK4. A Phase 1 multi-dose escalation clinical trial of PRT3645 has been completed. At the 2023 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, we presented data, showing that treatment with PRT3645 was associated with a substantial decrease in pRb and Ki67 expression, indicating a high level of target engagement at the doses evaluated. Also, PRT3645 was generally well tolerated in the initial three dose cohorts of patients with no clinically meaningful gastrointestinal, hematologic or neurological events reported to date, leveraging its enhanced selectivity profile. Having completed the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial of PRT3645, we intend to continue to explore continued clinical development with external partners. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development, organizing and staffing our company, business planning and raising capital. We have incurred recurring losses, the majority of which are attributable to research and development activities, and negative cash flows from operations. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of convertible preferred stock, common stock and pre-funded warrants. Our net loss was 98.4 million and 88.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 554.8 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through all stages of development and clinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. 
 Revenue 
 To-date, we have not recognized any revenue from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all. 
 In May 2024, the Company and Pathos AI, Inc. ("Pathos") entered into a license agreement under which the Company granted to Pathos an exclusive, sublicensable, world-wide license to its selective, brain-penetrant PRMT5 inhibitor, PRT811. Under the terms of the license agreement, the Company received a 3.0 million upfront, non-refundable payment. The agreement also includes a near term 4.0 million payment upon the earlier of 180 days following the effective date of the license agreement or the execution of a quality agreement between the parties pursuant to which the Company will transfer title to certain quantities of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient API ). In addition, the Company may receive potential developmental milestone payments up to 37.0 million, potential sales milestone payments up to 100 million and a range of high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on PRT811 global net sales. 
 The Company assessed the license agreement with Pathos in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customer, and concluded that Pathos is a customer. The Company evaluated all of the promised goods or services within the contract and determined which goods and services were separate performance obligations. The Company determined that the exclusive license and transfer of related know-how and materials represents one combined performance obligation. The execution of a quality agreement pursuant to which the Company will transfer title to certain API was identified as a separate performance obligation. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company satisfied the performance obligation related to the exclusive license and transfer of related know-how and materials which resulted in the recognition of revenue for 3.0 million previously deferred. The Company 
 20 

will recognize revenue of 4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 as the performance obligation for the execution of the quality agreement pursuant to which the Company transferred title to certain API was completed in early October 2024. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred, including: 
 expenses incurred to conduct the necessary discovery-stage laboratory work, preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval; 

personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in research and development functions; 

costs of funding research performed by third parties, including pursuant to agreements with clinical research organizations, or CROs, that conduct our clinical trials, as well as investigative sites, consultants and CROs that conduct our preclinical and nonclinical studies; 

expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, including manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; 

fees paid to consultants who assist with research and development activities; 

expenses related to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and 

allocated expenses for facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance. 

We track outsourced development costs and other external research and development costs to specific product candidates on a program-by-program basis, fees paid to CROs, CMOs and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. However, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they primarily relate to compensation, early research and other costs which are deployed across multiple projects under development. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, conduct our clinical trials, including later-stage clinical trials, for current and future product candidates and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees and consultants in executive, finance and accounting, legal, operations support, information technology and human resource functions. General and administrative expense also includes corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance, as well as legal fees related to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services. 
 We expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities and potential commercialization efforts. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants and legal support, among other expenses. The costs associated with being a public company include expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, insurance and investor relations costs. If any of our current or future product candidates obtains U.S. regulatory approval, we expect that we would incur significantly increased expenses associated with building a sales and marketing team. 
 21 

Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities and grant income received from the State of Delaware. We anticipate re-applying for grants from the State of Delaware from time to time as long as we maintain qualifying headcount levels. 
 Income Taxes 
 Since our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net operating losses, or NOLs, we have incurred or for our research and development tax credits, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our NOLs and tax credits will not be realized.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Since our inception, we have not recognized any revenue and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. 
 We will need to raise substantial additional capital to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we plan to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing as and when needed to finance our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 153.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2026. Since our inception, we have funded our operations through the sale of convertible preferred stock, common stock, and pre-funded warrants. 
 24 

During the second quarter of 2023, we sold 6,761,200 shares of common stock which comprised of (i) 5,312,978 shares of voting common stock and (ii) 1,448,222 shares of non-voting common stock at a price of 5.75 per share and to certain investors in lieu of common stock, we sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 12,895,256 shares of voting common stock at a price of 5.7499 per pre-funded warrant, resulting in gross proceeds of 113.0 million. We incurred offering costs of 2.6 million, of which 0.3 million were previously paid and deferred, which resulted in net proceeds of 110.4 million. The purchase price per share of each pre-funded warrant represents the per share offering price for the common stock, minus the 0.0001 per share exercise price of such pre-funded warrant. Of the voting common stock sold, 2,264,456 were purchased by our underwriters in connection with a 30-day option at a price of 5.75 per share. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we sold in a private placement pre-funded warrants to purchase 7,936,759 shares of voting common stock at a price of 3.1499 per pre-funded warrant, resulting in net proceeds of 24.8 million after deducting offering costs of 0.2 million. 
 We did not issue any securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, primarily research and development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for marketing approval and commercialization; 

the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our product candidates; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

the costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies; 

expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

costs associated with being a public company; 

the costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities; 

the costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and 

revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval. 

We will need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development expenditures, and business development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies. 
 In May 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement (the "2024 Shelf Registration Statement") with the SEC for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units up to an aggregate amount of 400 million. The 2024 Shelf Registration statement was declared effective on June 10, 2024. The 2024 Shelf Registration statement expires in May 2027, and as of September 30, 2024 there was 400.0 million remaining under the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement. 
 In March 2023, we filed a prospectus supplement to our existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the "2021 Shelf Registration Statement"). The 2021 Shelf Registration Statement permits the offering of up to 400.0 million aggregate dollar amount of shares of our common stock or preferred stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities and/or units consisting of some or all of 
 25 

these securities, in one or more offerings and in any combination. The 2021 Shelf Registration Statement expires on November 24, 2024, and as of September 30, 2024 there was 187.0 million remaining under the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement. In March 2023, in connection with filing a prospectus supplement to our 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with Jefferies LLC, as the sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering amount of up to 75.0 million. The 75.0 million of common stock that may be issued and sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement is included in the 400.0 million of securities that may be issued and sold pursuant to the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement. We will pay Jefferies LLC a commission rate of up to 3.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. We have 75.0 million remaining under the Sales Agreement as of September 30, 2024. Upon the expiry of the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, we expect to file a prospectus supplement to the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement in order to continue to allow us to access the Sales Agreement. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

 26 

Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 net cash used in financing activities was primarily for principal payments on our finance lease and the payment of offering costs related to the shelf registration statement, partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 111.2 million which was primarily the result of 110.8 million in proceeds received from the sale of common stock and pre-funded warrants, net of issuance costs. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The Company recognizes revenue under Accounting Standard Codification 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our revenue recognition analysis consists of the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue as we satisfy each performance obligation. 
 We apply significant judgment when we determine which goods and services are separate performance obligations, allocate the transaction price, and determine when a performance obligation has been satisfied. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligations when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. We recognize a liability when we have received payment but have not yet satisfied the related performance obligations. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no other material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 Subject to certain conditions, as an emerging growth company, we may rely on certain other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements, including without limitation, exemption to the requirements for providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (i.e. December 31, 2025), (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least 1.235 billion or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, or (b) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company after if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million. If we remain a smaller reporting company once we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 
 27 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item with respect to the period ending September 30, 2024. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure 
 As of September 30, 2024, management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management determined that, as of September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 28 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, we may receive letters alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial conditions should such litigation be resolved unfavorably. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making your decision to invest in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2024, in addition to the risk factors that appear below. 
 Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 
 Changes in United States and China relations, as well as relations with other countries, and/or regulations may adversely impact our business, our operating results, our ability to raise capital and the market price of our shares. 
 The U.S. government, including the SEC, has made statements and taken certain actions that led to changes to United States and international relations, and will impact companies with connections to the United States or China, including imposing several rounds of tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in China, imposing certain sanctions and restrictions in relation to China and issuing statements indicating enhanced review of companies with significant China-based operations. It is unknown whether and to what extent new legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws or regulations will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on companies with significant connections to the U.S. or to China, our industry or on us. Any unfavorable government policies on cross-border relations and/or international trade, including increased scrutiny on companies with significant China-based operations and escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, such as recent step up of military exercises around Taiwan by China, capital controls or tariffs, may affect our ability to raise capital and the market price of our shares. 
 There have been Congressional legislative proposals, such as the recent bill titled the Biosecure Act, to discourage contracting with Chinese companies on the development or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. If any new legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws and/or regulations are implemented, if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if the U.S. or Chinese governments take retaliatory actions due to the recent U.S.-China tension, such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise capital and the market price of our shares. 
 We are no longer developing our PRMT5 inhibitor, PRT811, and are dependent on our license agreement with Pathos AI, Inc. to develop and commercialize the asset. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement with Pathos (the Pathos License Agreement ), we granted an exclusive, world-wide license for our selective, brain-penetrant PRMT5 inhibitor, PRT811. Consequently, the commercial success of PRT811 will depend in significant part on the efforts of Pathos. Pathos will pay us milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development and sales milestone events, as well as royalties on sales of the licensed products. If Pathos is unable to commercialize PRT811, or determines not to pursue development or commercialization of PRT811, we will not receive any sales milestones or royalty payments under the Pathos License Agreement. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 The Company may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and Chinese anti-corruption law. 
 The Company is subject to the FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, foreign government officials and political parties by U.S. persons as defined by the statute for purposes of obtaining or retaining businesses. The Company may have agreements with third parties who may make sales in mainland China and the U.S., during the process of which the Company may be exposed to corruption. Activities in Taiwan create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by an employee, consultant or agent of the Company, because these parties are not always subject to the Company s control. 
 29 

Although the Company believes to date it has complied in all material aspects with the provisions of the FCPA and Chinese anti-corruption law, the existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and any of the Company s employees, consultants or agents may engage in corruptive conduct for which the Company might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption law may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions against the Company and individuals and therefore could negatively affect the Company s business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the Taiwanese government may seek to hold the Company liable as a successor for FCPA violations committed by companies in which the Company invests or acquires. 
 Artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that can impact our business including by posing security risks to our confidential information, proprietary information, and personal data. 
 Issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations. As with many technological innovations, artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that could impact our business. We may adopt and integrate generative artificial intelligence tools into our systems for specific use cases reviewed by legal and information security. Our vendors may incorporate generative artificial intelligence tools into their offerings without disclosing this use to us, and the providers of these generative artificial intelligence tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards with respect to privacy and data protection and may inhibit our or our vendors ability to maintain an adequate level of service and experience. If we, our vendors, or our third-party partners experience an actual or perceived breach or privacy or security incident because of the use of generative artificial intelligence, we may lose valuable intellectual property and confidential information and our reputation and the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed. Further, bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of artificial intelligence, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information, and intellectual property. Any of these outcomes could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information, and adversely impact our business.
