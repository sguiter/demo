ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

This section contains forward-looking statements which represent management s expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters. These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations, including the following: 

Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Company owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate; 

the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for Members; 

resolution by the Managing Members of conflicts with which they may be confronted; 

the success of the Managing Members of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics; 

the effect of tenant defaults; and 

the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Company operate. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Company s assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. It is possible that the carrying amount of the Company s assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, would be affected if management s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate. 

Management of the Company evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the Managing Member of the Company. 

Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties 

Upon acquisition of real properties, the Company records them in the financial statements at cost. The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market in-place leases. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the relative fair value of each component of the property. Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management s assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset. 

11

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods. The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities. Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. Below market lease values will be amortized on a straight-line basis as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income. 

The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management s consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining

 term of the respective leases. The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed. 

The determination of the relative fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables. If management s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income. 

Carrying Value of Properties 

Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For properties the Company will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value. For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value. Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties. 

Allocation of Expenses 

12

AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund s affairs. They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund s operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund s capitalization relative to other funds they manage. The Company reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Operating Agreement. 

Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations 

The Company is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues and investment property value. However, due to the current economic factors, higher interest rates, and inflation in the U.S. and globally, our tenants and operating partners may be impacted. 

Results of Operations 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized rental income of 1,233,800 and 1,213,429, respectively. Rental income increased due to multiple rent increases of various properties, as well as the purchase of an additional property in August 2023. This increase was partially offset by the abatement of rent for one property in the second quarter of 2024 and the sale of one property in February 2023 and one property in January 2024. Based on the scheduled rent for the properties owned as of October 31, 2024, the Company expects to recognize rental income of approximately 1,662,000 in 2024. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred LLC administration expenses from affiliated parties of 180,029 and 229,046, respectively. Expenses decreased due to the sale of a vacant property in 2024. These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communicating with the Limited Members. During the same periods, the Company incurred LLC administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of 83,434 and 184,032, respectively. Expenses decreased due to the sale of a vacant property in 2024. These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs. 

In September 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 60 interest in the Biomat property in Wichita, Kansas to an unrelated third party. The property was classified as real estate held for sale at December 31, 2022. On February 9, 2023, the sale closed with the Company receiving net proceeds of 1,418,133, which resulted in a net gain of 44,186. At the time of sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation was 2,839,297 and 1,465,350, respectively. 

13

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

In June 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with the tenant of the Piedmont Health (Fka Coliseum Health) property in Macon, Georgia to extend the lease term 87 months commencing on April 1, 2024 and expiring on June 30, 2031. As an inducement for the Tenant s extension of the lease term, fixed rent will be abated for the first three months of the new lease term. As part of the agreement, the annual rent decreased from 168,948 to 167,375 effective July 1, 2024. The Company also agrees to pay a commission to Tenant s real estate broker in the amount of 2 of the Fixed Rent to be paid during the period from April 1, 2024, to June 30, 2031, which is the amount of 23,968. The commission is recorded within acquired lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized over the lease term. 

The Company owned a 100 interest in a Premier Diagnostic Imaging Center in Terre Haute, Indiana. In June 2023, the Company performed a long-lived asset valuation analysis and determined the Premier Diagnostic Imaging Center in Terre Haute, Indiana was impaired. As a result, in the second quarter of 2023, the Company recognized real estate impairment of 90,000 to decrease the carrying value to the estimated fair value of 1,401,977. The charge was recorded against the land, building, in-place lease and above market lease. In December 2023, the Company performed another long-lived asset valuation analysis and determined the Premier Diagnostic Imaging Center in Terre Haute, Indiana was impaired. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized real estate impairment of 996,000 to decrease the carrying value to the estimated fair value of 405,977. The charge was recorded against the land, building, in-place lease and above market lease. In November 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 100 interest in the Premier Diagnostic Imaging Center in Terre Haute, Indiana. Consequently, this property was classified as Real Estate Held for Sale on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 with a carrying value of 405,977. On January 2, 2024, the sale closed with the Company receiving net proceeds of 406,688, which resulted in a net gain of 711. At the time of sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation was 1,248,000 and 842,023, respectively. 

On August 3, 2023 the Company purchased a 30 interest in the University of Iowa Health in Riverside, Iowa for 1,193,470 from AEI Property Corporation APC ), an affiliate of the Company. The purchase price of the property was based upon the property s fair market value as determined by an independent third party, commercial property appraiser. The Company allocated 141,940 of the purchase price to Acquired Intangible Lease Assets, representing in-place lease intangibles. The property is leased to Board of Regents, State of Iowa under a lease agreement with a remaining primary term of approximately 10 years (as of date of purchase) and annual rent of 73,215 scheduled to increase annually at 2.5 . 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized interest income of 34,087 and 47,428, respectively. 

Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations. Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases. Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value. However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions. 

14

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's cash balances increased 416,723 due to cash received from the sale of real estate and cash received from operations, which was partially offset by distributions paid to Members and the repurchase of Member Units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's cash balances decreased 188,163 as a result of cash used to purchase property, distributions paid to the Members and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities, which was partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of real estate. 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 923,116 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 945,802 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of an increase in rental income and a decrease in LLC administration and property management expenses in 2024. This was partially offset by timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses and a decrease in interest income in 2024. 

The major components of the Company's cash flow from investing activities are investments in real estate and proceeds from the sale of real estate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated cash flow from the sale of real estate of 406,688 and 1,418,133, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company used cash to purchase real estate of 0 and 1,217,438, respectively. 

The Company's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Members and cash used to repurchase Units. The Company declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter. The Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter. The Company may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company declared distributions of 835,671 and 852,368, respectively. Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions of Net Cash Flow are to be allocated 97 to the Limited Members and 3 to the Managing Members. Distributions of Net Proceeds of Sale are to be allocated 99 to the Limited Members and 1 to the Managing Members. The Limited Members were allocated declared distributions of 810,600 and 826,796 and the Managing Members were allocated declared distributions of 25,071 and 25,572 for the periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

The Company may repurchase Units from Limited Members who have tendered their Units to the Company. Such Units may be acquired at a discount. The Company will not be obligated to purchase in any year more than 2 of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Company. 

15

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)
