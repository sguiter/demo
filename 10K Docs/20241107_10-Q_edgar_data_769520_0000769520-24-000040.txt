Foreign exchange derivative contracts Financial Liabilities: Contingent consideration As of December 30, 2023 Financial Assets: Interest rate swaps Foreign exchange derivative contracts Financial Liabilities: Contingent consideration 
 The contingent consideration as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, relates to the earnout provisions recorded in conjunction with various purchase agreements. 
 Earn-out liabilities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as the methodology used to estimate fair value includes significant unobservable inputs reflecting management s own assumptions. The earnout provisions associated with these acquisitions are based upon performance measurements related to sales and earnings, as defined in the respective purchase agreement. On a quarterly basis, the company assesses the projected results for each of the acquisitions in comparison to the earnout targets and adjusts the liability accordingly. Discount rates for valuing contingent consideration are determined based on the company rates and specific acquisition risk considerations. Changes in fair value associated with the earnout provisions are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

 The net long-term deferred tax liability amounted to million. The net deferred tax liability is comprised of million related to the difference between the book and tax basis of identifiable intangible assets and million related to the difference between the book and tax basis on identifiable tangible asset and liability accounts. 
 The goodwill and million of other intangibles associated with the trade names are subject to the non-amortization provisions of ASC 350. Other intangibles also include million allocated to customer relationships, million allocated to developed technology, and million allocated to backlog, which are being amortized over periods of years, to years, and months, respectively. Goodwill of million and other intangibles of million are allocated to the Food Processing Equipment Group for segment reporting purposes. Goodwill of million and other intangibles of million are allocated to the Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group for segment reporting purposes. Goodwill of million and other intangibles of million are allocated to the Residential Kitchen Equipment Group for segment reporting purposes. Of these assets, goodwill of million and intangibles of million are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
 Four purchase agreements include earnout provisions providing for a contingent payment due to the sellers for the achievement of certain targets. Four earnouts are payable to the extent certain sales and EBITDA targets are met with measurement dates ending between 2024 and 2026. One earnout is payable upon the achievement of certain product rollout targets specific to the year of measurement. The contractual obligation associated with the contingent earnout provisions recognized on the acquisition date amount to million.

Current assets Property, plant and equipment ) Goodwill ) Other intangibles Other assets Current liabilities ) ) ) Other non-current liabilities ) ) Net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
 The goodwill and million of other intangibles associated with the trade name are subject to the non-amortization provisions of ASC 350. Other intangibles also include million allocated to customer relationships, which is being amortized over a period of years. Goodwill of million and other intangibles of million are allocated to the Food Processing Equipment Group for segment reporting purposes. Of these assets, goodwill of million and intangibles of million are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
 The company believes that information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but the company is waiting for additional information necessary to finalize those fair values for the acquisitions completed during 2024. Certain intangible assets are preliminarily valued using historical information from the Food Processing Equipment Group and qualitative assessment of the business at acquisition date. Specifically, the company estimated the fair values of the intangible assets based on the percentage of purchase price assigned to similar intangible assets in previous acquisitions. Thus, the provisional measurements of fair values set forth above are subject to change. The company expects to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date. 
 Pro Forma Financial Information 
 
 In accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, the following unaudited pro forma results of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, assumes the 2023 and 2024 acquisitions described above were completed on January 1, 2023 (first day of fiscal year 2023).

The historical consolidated financial information of the company and the acquisitions have been adjusted in the pro forma information to give effect to events that are (1) directly attributable to the transactions, (2) factually supportable and (3) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. Pro forma data may not be indicative of the results that would have been obtained had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it intended to be a projection of future results. Additionally, the pro forma financial information does not reflect the costs which the company has incurred or may incur to integrate the acquired businesses.

 Credit Facility 
 As of September 28, 2024, the company had billion of borrowings outstanding under its credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), including million outstanding under the term loan million, net of unamortized issuance fees) and million outstanding under the delayed draw term loan. The company also had million in outstanding letters of credit as of September 28, 2024, which reduces the borrowing availability under the Credit Facility. Remaining borrowing capacity under this facility was billion at September 28, 2024. 
 On August 11, 2022, the company borrowed million against the delayed draw term facility as provided under the Credit Agreement. The funds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolver. The delayed draw term loan amortizes in quarterly installments due on the last day of each fiscal quarter, and commenced on December 31, 2022, in an amount equal to of the principal drawn, with the balance, plus any accrued interest payable by October 21, 2026. 
 At September 28, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facility accrued interest at a rate of above the daily simple or term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR per annum or above the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus and one month Term SOFR plus . The interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility may be adjusted quarterly based on the company s Funded Debt less Unrestricted Cash to Pro Forma EBITDA (the Leverage Ratio on a rolling four-quarter basis. Additionally, a commitment fee based upon the Leverage Ratio is charged on the unused portion of the commitments under the Credit Facility. As of September 28, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facility accrued interest at a minimum of above SOFR and the variable unused commitment fee will be at a minimum of . Borrowings under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a minimum of above the daily simple SOFR or term SOFR for the applicable interest period (each of which includes a spread adjustment of ). The average interest rate per annum, inclusive of hedging instruments, on the debt under the Credit Facility was equal to at the end of the period and the variable commitment fee was equal to per annum as of September 28, 2024. 
 The term loan and delayed draw term loan facilities had an average interest rate per annum, inclusive of hedging instruments, of as of September 28, 2024. 
 In addition, the company has international credit facilities to fund working capital needs outside the United States. At September 28, 2024, these foreign credit facilities amounted to million in U.S. Dollars with a weighted average per annum interest rate of approximately . 
 
 The company s debt is reflected on the balance sheet at cost. The fair values of the Credit Facility, term debt and foreign and other debt is based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the company's incremental borrowing rate. The company believes its interest rate margins, based on the company s Leverage Ratio, on its existing debt are consistent with current market conditions and therefore the carrying value of debt reflects the fair value. The carrying value and estimated aggregate fair value, a level 2 measurement, based primarily on market prices, of debt excluding the Convertible Notes is as follows (in thousands): 
 Sep 28, 2024 Dec 30, 2023 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Total debt excluding convertible senior notes

The company uses floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge variable interest rate risk associated with the Credit Facility. At September 28, 2024, the company had outstanding floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps totaling million notional amount carrying an average interest rate of maturing in less than 12 months and million notional amount carrying an average interest rate of that mature in more than 12 months but less than 41 months. 
 
 At September 28, 2024, the company was in compliance with all covenants pursuant to its borrowing agreements.

 The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was million as of September 28, 2024 and was determined through consideration of quoted market prices. The fair value is classified as Level 2, as defined in Note 1(d), Fair Value Measurements , in these Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement . The if-converted value of the Convertible Notes exceeded their respective principal value by million as of September 28, 2024. 
 
 Capped Call Transactions 
 In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the company entered into privately negotiated Capped Call Transactions (the "2020 Capped Call Transactions") and the company used the net proceeds of the offering of the Convertible Notes to pay the aggregate amount of million for them. The company entered into two tranches of privately negotiated Capped Call Transactions in December 2021 (the "2021 Capped Call Transactions") in the aggregate amount of million. On March 15, 2022, the company entered into an additional tranche of privately negotiated Capped Call Transactions (the "2022 Capped Call Transactions") in the amount of million . 
 The 2020, 2021, and 2022 Capped Call Transactions (collectively, the "Capped Call Transactions") are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset the cash payments the company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes upon conversion of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of the company's common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions (which initially corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions), with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The 2020 Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of per share of the company's common stock. The 2021 Capped Call Transactions have initial cap prices of and per share of the company's common stock. The 2022 Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of per share. The Capped Call Transactions cover, initially, the number of shares of the company's common stock underlying the Convertible Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes. 
 
 17 

The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by the company with the capped call counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes and will not affect any holder's right under the Convertible Notes.

 Current Events 
 
 Inflation and Interest Rate Environment 
 
 The company has been negatively impacted by inflation in wages, logistics, energy, raw materials and component costs. Price increases and pricing strategies have been implemented to mitigate the impact of cost inflation on margins and the company continues to actively monitor costs. High inflation and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy 
 decisions led to increased interest rates in 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024, which combined with global macroeconomic uncertainty, has and may continue to impact customer demand. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates in the third quarter of 2024, the first in a string of cuts expected into 2025. Interest rates and global macroeconomic uncertainty has and may continue to impact customer demand across our businesses. Even in light of such headwinds, we remain focused on delivering strong financial results and executing on our long-term strategy and profitability objectives. 
 
 Supply Chain, Labor and Logistics Constraints 
 
 The company continues to actively monitor global supply chain, labor and logistics constraints, which have had a negative impact on the company's ability to source parts and complete and ship units. While the company is seeing improvement on certain supply chain and logistics constraints, supply chains for certain key components remain distressed. The decreased availability of resources and inflationary costs have resulted in heightened inventory levels. To combat these pressures, the company has evaluated alternative sourcing, dual sourcing and collaborated across the organization, where appropriate, without materially presenting new risks or increasing current risks around quality and reliability. Our capital resources have been and the company expects they will continue to be sufficient to address these challenges.

 OPERATING ACTIVITIES . Net cash provided by operating activities after changes in assets and liabilities amounted to 447.1 million as compared to 373.1 million in the prior year. 
 During the nine months period ended September 28, 2024, working capital changes meaningfully impacted operating cash flows primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable of 31.4 million due to lower sales levels, decreased inventory levels of 33.1 million. These were offset by a 41.7 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities related to impacts from the timing of payments of various customer and incentive programs. 
 INVESTING ACTIVITIES. During the nine months period ended September 28, 2024, net cash used for investing activities amounted to 44.0 million. Cash used to fund acquisitions amounted to 7.8 million . Additionally, 36.2 million was expended, primarily for upgrades of production equipment and manufacturing facilities. 
 FINANCING ACTIVITIES. Net cash flows used for financing activities amounted to 45.8 million during the nine months period ended September 28, 2024. The company s borrowing activities during 2024 included 21.9 million of net repayments under its Credit Facility. Additionally, during 2024, the company used 18.3 million to repurchase 118,026 shares of Middleby common stock that were surrendered to the company for withholding taxes related to restricted stock vestings. 
 At September 28, 2024, the company was in compliance with all covenants pursuant to its borrowing agreements. The company believes that its current capital resources, including cash and cash equivalents, cash expected to be generated from operations, funds available from its current lenders and access to the credit and capital markets will be sufficient to finance its operations, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, product development and expenditures for the foreseeable future. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 
 See Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4 - Recently Issued Accounting Standards, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences could be material to the company's consolidated financial statements. There have been no changes in the company's critical accounting policies, which include revenue recognition, inventories, goodwill and indefinite-life intangibles, convertible debt, pensions benefits, and income taxes, as discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ).

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The following table summarizes the maturity of the company s debt obligations: 
 Twelve Month Period coinciding with the end of the company's Fiscal Third Quarter 
 
 Variable Rate Debt 2025 44,289 2026 788,146 2027 1,567,261 2028 737 2029 and thereafter 4,877 2,405,310 
 The company is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating-rate debt. The company has entered into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate applicable to certain of its variable-rate debt. The agreements swapped one-month LIBOR for fixed rates. In February 2022, the company entered into an additional floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement that uses a daily SOFR in lieu of LIBOR. In April 2023, all outstanding LIBOR swap agreements were amended to one month term SOFR. The company has designated these swaps as cash flow hedges and all changes in fair value of the swaps are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of September 28, 2024, the fair value of these instruments was an asset of 25.6 million. The change in fair value of these swap agreements in the first nine months of 2024 was a loss of 12.2 million, net of taxes. The potential net loss on fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted interest rates would not have a material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The company has Convertible Notes that were issued in August 2020, which carry a fixed annual interest rate of 1.00 . As such, the company does not have economic interest rate exposure on the Convertible Notes. The fair value of the Convertible Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to its conversion feature. The fair value of the Convertible Notes is also affected by the price and volatility of the company s common stock and will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of the Convertible Notes but do not impact the company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, the company carries the Convertible Notes at face value, less any unamortized discount on the balance sheet and presents the fair value for disclosure purposes only. 
 Foreign Exchange Derivative Financial Instruments 
 The company uses derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The company s primary hedging activities are to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates on intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables. The company does not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In managing its foreign currency exposures, the company identifies and aggregates naturally occurring offsetting positions and then hedges residual balance sheet exposures. The potential net loss on fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The fair value of the forward and option contracts was a gain of 0.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 31 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 The company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company's Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 28, 2024, the company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of this period. 
 During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, there has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 The company was not required to report the information pursuant to Items 1 through 6 of Part II of Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, except as follows: 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plan or Program Maximum 
 Number of 
 Shares that May 
 Yet be 
 Purchased 
 Under the Plan 
 or Program (1) 
 June 30, 2024 to July 27, 2024 4,383,636 July 28, 2024 to August 24, 2024 4,383,636 August 25, 2024 to September 28, 2024 4,383,636 Quarter ended September 28, 2024 4,383,636 
 
 (1) On November 7, 2017, the company's Board of Directors resolved to terminate the company's existing share repurchase program, effective as of such date, which was originally adopted in 1998, and approved a new stock repurchase program. This program authorizes the company to repurchase in the aggregate up to 2,500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. In May 2022 and July 2024, the company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of an additional 2,500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock under the current program. As of September 28, 2024, the total number of shares authorized for repurchase under the program is 7,500,000 shares. As of September 28, 2024, 3,116,364 shares had been purchased under the stock repurchase program and 4,383,636 shares remained authorized for repurchase. 
 
 In the consolidated financial statements, the company also treats shares withheld for tax purposes on behalf of employees in connection with the vesting of restricted share grants as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares are not considered common stock repurchases under the authorized common stock repurchase plan and accordingly are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table.
