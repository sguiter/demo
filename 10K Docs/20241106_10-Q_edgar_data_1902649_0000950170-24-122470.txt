The Fund may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself. The Fund offers on a continuous basis up to billion of common shares of beneficial interest Common Shares pursuant to an offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Fund offers to sell any combination of three classes of Common Shares, Institutional Class shares, Class S shares and Class D shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different ongoing shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees. The initial purchase price for the Institutional Class shares was per share. Thereafter, the purchase price per share for each class of Common Shares equals the net asset value per share, as of the effective date of the monthly share purchase date. The Fund also engages in private offerings of its Common Shares.

 of the capitalization of the Fund. Investments listed on a recognized exchange or market quotation system, whether U.S. or foreign, are valued using the closing price on the date of valuation. Investments not listed on a recognized exchange or market quotation system, but for which reliable market quotations are readily available are valued using prices provided by a nationally recognized pricing service or by using quotations from broker-dealers. Investments for which market quotations are either not readily available or are determined to be unreliable are priced at fair value using affirmative valuations performed by independent valuation services approved by the Valuation Designee or, for investments aggregating less than of the total assets of the Fund, using valuations determined directly by the Valuation Designee. Such valuations are determined under documented valuation policies and procedures reviewed and approved by a committee established by the Valuation Designee (the "Valuation Committee"). Generally, to increase objectivity in valuing the investments, the Valuation Designee will utilize external measures of value, such as public markets or third-party transactions, whenever possible. The Valuation Designee s valuation is not based on long-term work-out value, immediate liquidation value, nor incremental value for potential changes that may take place in the future. The values assigned to investments are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot reasonably be determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated. Such circumstances may include macroeconomic, geopolitical and other events, rising interest rates and risks related to inflation that may significantly impact the profitability or viability of businesses in which the Fund is invested, and therefore may significantly impact the return on and realizability of the Fund s investments. The foregoing policies apply to all investments, including any in companies and groups of affiliated companies aggregating more than of the Fund s assets. Fair valuations of investments in each asset class are determined using one or more methodologies including market quotations, the market approach, income approach, or, in the case of recent investments, the cost approach, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Such information may include observed multiples of earnings and/or revenues at which transactions in securities of comparable companies occur, with appropriate adjustments for differences in company size, operations or other factors affecting comparability. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present value amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The discount rates used for such analyses reflect market yields for comparable investments, considering such factors as relative credit quality, capital structure, and other factors. In following these approaches, the types of factors that may be taken into account also include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, comparable costs of capital, the principal market in which the investment trades and enterprise values. Investments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in valuing such investments. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an investment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Transfers between levels are recognized as of the beginning of the reporting period.

Investments in foreign companies and securities of foreign governments may involve special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and securities of the U.S. Government. These risks include, among other things, revaluation of currencies, less reliable information about issuers, different transaction clearance and settlement practices, and potential future adverse political and economic developments. Moreover, investments in foreign companies and securities of foreign governments and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. Government.

of the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar month and payable monthly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, net assets means the Fund s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. The Investment Adviser waived its management fee for the first twelve months following the date of the commencement of the Fund's operations. On April 25, 2023, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved an amendment of the Amended and Restated Fee Waiver and Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement, which extended the waiver through December 31, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Investment Adviser earned million and million in management fees, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Investment Adviser earned and waived million and million in management fees, respectively. Incentive Fees Incentive compensation is payable to the Investment Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. The incentive fee consists of two components, an income component and a capital gains component. Each component of the incentive fee will be calculated and, if due, will be payable quarterly in arrears. The Investment Adviser waived all incentive fee for the first twelve months following the commencement of the Fund's operations. On April 25, 2023, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved an amendment of the Expense Support Agreement, which extended the waiver through December 31, 2023.

 of the aggregate net investment income before incentive compensation earned for the most recent calendar quarter and the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the Fund), less aggregate income incentive compensation previously paid in with respect to the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant trailing twelve quarters. The income component of the incentive fee is subject to a total return hurdle on daily weighted average unreturned capital contributions (the Hurdle Rate ). As such, the Fund will not be obligated to pay any income incentive fee to the extent the annualized trailing twelve quarter (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since the commencement of the Fund) total return of the Fund (as defined below), including net realized gains and losses and net unrealized appreciation and depreciation, does not exceed the Hurdle Rate. To the extent that the Fund s annualized total return for the relevant period exceeds the Hurdle Rate, but is less than approximately of daily weighted average unreturned capital contributions, the income incentive fee will be subject to a catch up , calculated as of the aggregate net investment income before incentive compensation earned in excess of Hurdle Rate for the relevant period. To the extent that the Fund s annualized total return for the relevant period exceeds approximately , the income component of the incentive fee will be equal to of net investment income before incentive compensation earned in excess of this total return threshold. For purposes of calculating the income incentive fee, (i) total return means the amount equal to the combination of net investment income before incentive compensation, realized capital gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation of the Fund for the period in question; (ii) unreturned capital contributions means the proceeds to the Fund of all issuances of common shares, less all distributions by the Fund to shareholders representing a return of capital. The capital gains component of the incentive fee will be the amount, if positive, equal to of the aggregate realized capital gains (computed net of realized losses and net of unrealized capital depreciation, if any) for the most recent calendar quarter and the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the Fund), less capital gains incentive compensation previously paid or distributed in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant trailing twelve quarters. The capital gains component will be paid in full prior to payment of the income component. In any case, incentive fee (including both the income and capital gains components) will only be paid to the extent the trailing twelve quarter (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the fund) total return of the Fund after incentive compensation and including such payment would equal or exceed a annual total return on daily weighted average unreturned contributed capital contributions for such period. In addition, GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fees accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fees would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Advisory Agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Fund to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fee paid or capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. The resulting accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Investment Adviser earned million and million in incentive fees, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Investment Adviser earned and waived million and million in incentive fees, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, incentive fees on capital gains accrued on a liquidation basis (but not payable) under GAAP were million and million on a cumulative basis, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the fund did not accrue any incentive fees on capital gains on a liquidation basis (but not payable) under GAAP. Sub-Advisory Fees Pursuant to the sub-advisory agreement, dated as of May 31, 2022 (the Sub-Advisory Agreement ), the Investment Adviser, and not the Fund, will pay a portion of the management fee received by the Investment Adviser to the Sub-Adviser as a sub-advisory fee to the Sub-Adviser in an amount equal to a percentage of the average daily value of the Fund s assets allocated to the Sub-Adviser.

 cap on NAV for Class S shares, and a cap on NAV for Class D shares. Selling agents will not charge such fees on Institutional shares. Either party may terminate the Distribution Agreement upon 60 days written notice to the other party or immediately upon notice to the other party in the event such other party failed to comply with a material provision of the Distribution Agreement. Distribution and Servicing Plan On February 27, 2024, the Fund s Board of Trustees approved a distribution and servicing plan (the Distribution and Servicing Plan ). 

Class D Shares 

Institutional Shares 

The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees is paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month and subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation. The Distributor will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate NAV for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the NAV with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under the Fund s distribution reinvestment plan. Eligibility to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class S or Class D shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding the Fund, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Distributor will waive the shareholder servicing fee and/or distribution that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase. The Fund will cease paying the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee on the Class S and Class D shares on the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of Institutional shares, (ii) our merger or consolidation with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or (iii) the date following the completion of the primary portion of this offering on which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources in connection with this offering, including the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee and other underwriting compensation, is equal to of the gross proceeds from our primary offering. In addition, consistent with exemptive relief allowing us to offer multiple classes of shares, at the end of the month in which the Distributor in conjunction with the transfer agent determines that total transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, and shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees paid with respect to any single share held in a shareholder s account would exceed, in the aggregate, of the gross proceeds from the sale of such share (or a lower limit as determined by the Distributor or the applicable selling agent), we will cease paying the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee on all Class S and Class D shares in such shareholder s account. We may modify this requirement if permitted by applicable exemptive relief. At the end of the month in which such (or lower) limit it met, the applicable Class S shares and Class D shares in such shareholder s account will convert into a number of Institutional shares (including any fractional shares), with an equivalent aggregate NAV as such Class S and Class D shares.

The Fund may elect either the term SOFR or prime rate at the time of drawdown. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Fund that are formed or acquired by the Fund in the future (collectively, the Guarantors ). The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Fund and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.

of the value of the Fund s net assets, calculated monthly based on month-end net assets.

 of the Fund s common shares of beneficial interest Common Shares ). The Fund is offering to sell any combination of three classes of Common Shares, Class D shares, Class S shares and Institutional shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different ongoing shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees. The purchase price per share for each class of Common Shares equals the Fund s NAV per share, as of the effective date of the monthly share purchase date. The Fund s offering is a best efforts offering, which means that BlackRock Investments, LLC, the distributor for the offering, will use its best efforts to sell shares, but is not obligated to purchase or sell any specific amount of shares in this offering. The Fund has the authority to issue an unlimited number of Common Shares of any class and an unlimited number of shares of preferred shares, at a par value per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Fund had Institutional shares, Class S shares, and Class D shares issued and outstanding.

We expect to determine our NAV for each class of shares each month as of the last day of each calendar month. The NAV per share for each class of shares is determined by dividing the value of total assets attributable to the class minus liabilities attributable to the class by the total number of Common Shares outstanding of the class at the date as of which the determination is made. Shares are issued at an offering price equivalent to the most recent NAV per share available for each share class, which will be the prior calendar day NAV per share (i.e. the prior month-end NAV).

 of the Fund s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Fund does not intend to conduct a share repurchase offer during any calendar quarter for which our liquid assets plus available and undrawn leverage are less than of our net assets as of the date of the most recent publicly available NAV prior to the commencement of such calendar quarter. In addition, our Board of Trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. Under the Fund s share repurchase plan, to the extent the Fund offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, the Fund expects to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers on or around the last business day of that quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last business day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ).The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived at the Fund s or Distributor s discretion in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder, or due to trade or operational error. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be waived in the event that a shareholder s shares are repurchased because the shareholder has failed to maintain the minimum account balance. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders. The Fund commenced its initial quarterly repurchase offer on April 28, 2023. On July 31, 2024, the Fund initiated a quarterly offer to repurchase up to of its shares outstanding as of June 30, 2024, commencing on July 31, 2024 and ending on August 30, 2024, with a valuation date of June 30, 2024.

 Overview 
 The Fund is a Delaware statutory trust formed on December 23, 2021 and is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Our investment objective is to achieve high risk-adjusted returns produced primarily from current income generated by investing primarily in senior secured corporate debt instruments. We seek to achieve our investment objective through investments in privately-originated, performing senior secured debt primarily in North America-based companies with target enterprise values between 100 million and 1.5 billion. Performing debt is debt that at the time of investment is not defaulted or, in the view of the Advisers, distressed. The Fund targets positions in first lien, second lien and unitranche debt, with a preference for floating-rate debt, which the Advisers believe provides flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions. The Fund may invest in securities of any maturity and credit quality. Our investment activities will benefit from what we believe are the competitive advantages of our Advisers, including its diverse in-house skills, proprietary deal flow, and consistent and rigorous investment process focused on established, middle-market companies. 
 The Fund has elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, the Fund will not be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. 
 52 

To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our shareholders generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that we distribute to our shareholders provided that we satisfy those requirements. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies, public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as amended, public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We are also permitted to make certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 94.9 of our total assets were invested in qualifying assets. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold. We also generate revenue from dividends on our equity interests, capital gains on the disposition of investments, and certain lease, fee, and other income. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or PIK. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, structuring or due diligence fees, end-of-term or exit fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance, consulting fees and other investment related income. 
 Expenses 
 The Fund will be responsible for paying the compensation of the Investment Advisers. In addition, the Fund will generally be responsible for all operating expenses of the Fund, and shall pay, and shall reimburse the Investment Adviser or the Administrator and their respective affiliates for, all fees, costs, expenses, liabilities and obligations of the Fund relating or attributable to: 
 our organization; 

calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); 

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

the base management fee and any incentive fee; 

dividends and distributions on our Common Shares; 

administration fees payable under the Administration Agreement; 

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

registration fees; 

taxes; 

director fees and expenses; 

costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC; 

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders, including printing costs; 

our fidelity bond; 

directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

53 

indemnification payments; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit and legal costs; and 

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us and the Administrator in connection with administering our business, such as the allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement, including rent and other allocable portions of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs. 

The Advisory Agreement provides that the management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.25 of the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar month and payable monthly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, net assets means the Fund s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. For the first calendar month in which the Fund had operations, net assets were measured as the beginning net assets as of the date on which the Fund first issued Common Shares to one or more investors (other than the Investment Adviser and its affiliates). The Investment Adviser agreed to waive its management fee for the first twelve months following the date of the commencement of the Fund s operations. 
 Additionally, the Advisory Agreement provides that the Investment Adviser may be entitled to incentive fee under certain circumstances. According to the terms of such agreement, the incentive fee equals the sum of (i) 12.5 of all net investment income and (ii) 12.5 of all net realized capital gains (net of any net unrealized capital depreciation) less net investment income incentive fee and capital gains incentive fee previously paid. However, incentive fee will only be paid to the extent the cumulative total return of the Fund after the incentive fee and including such payment would equal or exceed a 5 annual return on daily weighted-average unreturned contributed capital contributions. The determination of the incentive fee is subject to limitations under the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act. 
 Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Fee Waiver and Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement between the Fund and the Investment Adviser, dated as of August 29, 2022, as amended on April 25, 2023, the Investment Adviser agreed to waive its base management fee and incentive fee for the period from the date of the commencement of the Fund s operations through December 31, 2023. 
 Pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Investment Adviser, and not the Fund, will pay a portion of the management fee received by the Investment Adviser to the Sub-Adviser as a sub-advisory fee to the Sub-Adviser in an amount equal to a percentage of the average daily value of the Fund s assets allocated to the Sub-Adviser. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of portfolio investments 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated the Investment Adviser as the Fund's valuation designee (the "Valuation Designee") to perform certain fair value functions, including performing fair value determinations. As required by Rule 2a-5, the Valuation Designee provides periodic fair valuation reporting and notifications on behalf of the Fund to the Board of Trustees to facilitate the Board of Trustees' oversight duties. 
 We value our portfolio investments at fair value based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in the Valuation Designee's policies and procedures adopted for the Fund by the Valuation Designee. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset that (i) are independent of us, (ii) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all available information (including information that might be obtained through due diligence efforts that are usual and customary), (iii) are able to transact for the asset, and (iv) are willing to transact for the asset or liability (that is, they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so). 
 When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by the Valuation Designee to be inaccurate or unreliable, the Fund s investments are valued at fair value Fair Value Assets ). Fair Value Assets are valued by the Valuation Designee in accordance with documented valuation policies and procedures reviewed and approved by a committee established by the Valuation Designee (the 
 54 

"Valuation Committee"). The Valuation Designee may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available, inaccurate or unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete lack of trading, if the Valuation Designee believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (e.g., where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. 
 For this purpose, a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation is deemed to occur if the Valuation Designee determines, in its business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund s assets or liabilities, that it is likely that the event will cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where markets quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread. On any date the NYSE is open and the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day s price, provided that the Valuation Designee is not aware of any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset. For certain foreign securities, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign securities following the close of the local markets to the price that might have prevailed as of the Fund s pricing time. 
 A substantial portion of the Fund s assets are expected to consist of securities of private companies for which there are no readily available market quotations. The information available in the marketplace for such companies, their securities and the status of their businesses and financial conditions is often extremely limited, outdated and difficult to confirm. Such securities are valued by the Fund monthly at fair value as determined pursuant to the principles and methods of valuation set forth in the Valuation Designee's policies and procedures adopted for the Fund by the Valuation Designee and approved by the Board of Trustees. In determining fair value each month, the Valuation Designee is required to consider all appropriate factors relevant to value and all indicators of value available to the Fund. The determination of fair value necessarily involves judgment in evaluating this information in order to determine the price that the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon its current sale. The most relevant information may often be that information which is provided by the issuer of the securities. Given the nature, timeliness, amount and reliability of information provided by the issuer, fair valuations may become more difficult and uncertain as such information is unavailable or becomes outdated. Because the Fund will value all of its assets monthly, the Fund is subject to greater risk that the information available to determine fair value on any given day is uncertain, incomplete and potentially unreliable and, as a result, that the prices assigned to fair valued securities may not in fact represent approximately the price that the Fund could receive upon their current sale. 
 Certain investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued on a monthly basis utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data (e.g., information available through regulatory filings, press releases, news feeds and financial press), including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, information provided by the company (e.g., letters to investors, financials, information provided pursuant to financial document reporting obligations), security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables and enterprise values. 
 With respect to the Fund s investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, the Valuation Designee has approved a valuation process that takes into account a variety of inputs. 
 When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the Valuation Committee shall seek to determine the price that the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations shall be based upon all available factors that the Valuation Committee deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by the Valuation Designee using proprietary or third party valuation models. 
 Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining the Fund s NAV, and the differences between the fair value of the assets and the prices 
 55 

at which those assets are ultimately sold may be significant. As a result, the Fund s sale or repurchase of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders. Information that becomes known to the Fund or its agents after the NAV has been calculated in a particular month will not be used to retroactively adjust the price of a security or the NAV determined earlier that month. 
 The Fund s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, follow the requirements for valuation set forth in ASC 820, which defines and establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements. 
 The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined as follows: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
 Level 2: Other direct and indirect observable market inputs (for example, quoted prices in inactive markets or quotes for comparable investments) 
 Level 3: Independent third-party valuation sources that employ significant unobservable inputs 
 As of September 30, 2024, none of our investments were categorized as Level 1, 29.9 were categorized as Level 2 and 70.1 were Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by independent third party sources. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Valuation Designee's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the investment. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue recognition 
 Interest and dividend income, including income paid in kind, is recorded on an accrual basis, when such amounts are considered collectible. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts, earned with respect to capital commitments are generally amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment. Other fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar income due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income. 
 Certain of our debt investments are purchased at a discount to par as a result of the underlying credit risks and financial results of the issuer, as well as general market factors that influence the financial markets as a whole. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate bonds are generally amortized using the effective-interest or constant-yield method assuming there are no questions as to collectability. When principal payments on a loan are received in an amount in excess of the loan s amortized cost, the excess principal payments are recorded as interest income. 
 Debt investments are generally placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal or interest will not be collected according to the contractual terms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid interest (including any accrued PIK interest) is generally reversed, and discount accretion or premium amortization is discontinued. The Fund does not reverse previously capitalized PIK income. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Fund's judgment regarding collectability of the outstanding principal and interest. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid or, in the Fund's judgement, the repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. The Fund may opt not to place a distressed debt investment on non-accrual status if principal and interest are secured through sufficient collateral value and are in the process of collection through legal actions or other efforts that are expected to result in repayment of principal and interest. 
 Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.

 Incentive compensation 
 The income component of the incentive fee will be the amount, if positive, equal to 12.5 of the aggregate net investment income before incentive compensation earned for the most recent calendar quarter and the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the fund), less aggregate income incentive compensation previously paid in with respect to the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant trailing twelve quarters. The income component of the incentive fee is subject to a 5.0 total return hurdle on daily weighted average unreturned capital contributions (the Hurdle Rate ). The capital gains component of the incentive fee will be the amount, if positive, equal to 12.5 of the aggregate realized capital gains (computed net of realized losses and net of unrealized capital depreciation, if any) for the most recent calendar quarter and the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the fund), less capital gains incentive compensation previously paid or distributed in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant trailing twelve quarters. The capital gains component will be paid in full prior to payment of the income component. In any case, incentive compensation (including both the income and capital gains components) will only be paid to the extent the trailing twelve quarter (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the fund) total return of the Fund after incentive compensation and including such payment would equal or exceed a 5 annual total return on daily weighted average unreturned contributed capital contributions for such period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 4.1 million in incentive fees were earned, comparing to 2.3 million earned and waived for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Income tax expense, including excise tax 
 The Fund has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, the Fund must, among other things, timely distribute to its shareholders generally at least 90 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. The Fund has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its shareholders which will generally relieve the Fund from U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income. Any excise tax expense is recorded at year end as such amounts are known. No excise tax expense was incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 
 The net increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations was 12.2 million and 8.4 million, respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The net increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations was 28.1 million and 20.0 million, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are expected to be generated primarily through the offerings of the Fund's common shares, borrowings under the Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, and cash flows from operations, including investments sales and repayments and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. The primary uses of cash have been investments in portfolio companies and other general corporate purposes. 
 Our primary uses of cash are expected to be for investments in portfolio companies and other investments, for operational costs such as paying the Investment Adviser and Administrator, for costs related to our credit facility and for distributions to our shareholders. 
 The Investment Adviser has agreed to pay all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf (including legal, accounting, printing, mailing, subscription processing and filing fees and expenses and other offering expenses, including costs associated with technology integration between the Fund s systems and those of our participating brokers, reasonable bona fide due diligence expenses of participating brokers supported by detailed and itemized invoices, costs in connection with preparing sales materials and other marketing expenses, design and website expenses, fees and expenses of our transfer agent, fees to attend retail seminars sponsored by participating brokers and costs, expenses and reimbursements for travel, meals, accommodations, entertainment and other similar expenses related to meetings or events with prospective investors, brokers, registered investment advisors or financial or other advisors, but excluding the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee) through the commencement of the Fund s operations. 
 Pursuant to the Fee Waiver and Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement we have entered into with the Investment Adviser, we will be obligated to reimburse the Investment Adviser for expenses during the 36 months following the commencement of the Fund s operations, to the extent that the Fund s annual Operating Expenses do not exceed 1.25 of the value of the Fund s net assets, calculated monthly based on month-end net assets of the Fund. 
 On June 3, 2022, BlackRock Private Credit Fund Leverage I, LLC (the Borrower ), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund, established a 200 million combined revolving credit and term loan facility with PNC Bank, National Association as facility agent (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility matures on June 3, 2032 and generally bears interest at three-month Term SOFR, plus (a) 1.55 if the aggregate balance of Middle Market Loans is less than or equal to 25 , (b) 1.65 if the aggregate balance of Middle Market Loans is above 25 and less than or equal to 50 , (c) 1.80 if the aggregate balance of Middle Market Loans is above 50 and less than or equal to 75 , or (d) 1.90 if the aggregate balance of Middle Market Loans is above 75 . The Credit Facility also accrues commitment fees on any undrawn amounts at an annual rate of 0.50 , or 0.35 for the period from the closing date of the Credit Facility to the three-month anniversary of the closing date. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by the Borrower. Under the Credit Facility, the Borrower has made certain customary representations and warranties, and is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. 
 On September 8, 2023, the Borrower entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facility (the Amendment ). The Amendment extended the term commitment termination date under the Credit Facility with respect to term commitments entered into on the closing date to December 8, 2023. On December 15, 2023, the Borrower entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Facility (the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment increased the total revolving commitments from 50.0 million to 75.0 million, increased total term commitments from 150.0 million to 225.0 million, and increased the facility margin level applicable to the borrower. The Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are 
 60 

considered our borrowings for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2024, there was 217.0 million drawn on the Credit Facility. 
 On April 19, 2024, the Fund entered into a Senior Secured Credit Agreement for a 75 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent, and the lenders and issuing banks from time to time parties thereto. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 19, 2029 and generally bears interest at either (i) term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment plus margin of 2.00 or 1.875 per annum or (ii) the prime rate plus a margin of 2.00 or 1.875 per annum, in each case subject to certain conditions. The Fund may elect either the term SOFR or prime rate at the time of drawdown. The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Fund that are formed or acquired by the Fund in the future (collectively, the Guarantors ). The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Fund and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Fund is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding loans on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Under Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, prior to March 23, 2018, a BDC was generally not permitted to issue senior securities unless after giving effect thereto the BDC met a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which includes all borrowings of the BDC, of at least 200 . On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act SBCAA was signed into law, which among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs from 200 to 150 so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. After obtaining shareholder approval by written consent on March 16, 2022, the Fund s asset coverage requirement was reduced from 200 to 150 , as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As of September 30, 2024, the Fund's asset coverage ratio was 341 . 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 308.5 million, consisting primarily of the settlement of acquisitions of investments (net of dispositions) of 334.8 million, and net investment income (net of non-cash income and expenses) of approximately 26.3 million.

capitalization, operation or administration and any portfolio investments, as applicable. The Investment Adviser is not responsible for any of the foregoing expenses. The Fund may terminate each of the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other party and the Investment Adviser and the Administrator may terminate the Advisory Agreement or Administration Agreement, as applicable, without penalty upon not less than 120 days written notice to the other party. The Sub-Advisory Agreement may be terminated as a whole at any time by the Fund without the payment of any penalty, upon the vote of a majority of the Board of Trustees or a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by the Investment Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, on 60 days written notice by either party to the other. 
 On June 3, 2022, the Fund entered into the Credit Facility, a 200 million revolving credit facility that matures on June 3, 2032 and generally bears interest at a floating rate. On September 8, 2023, the Borrower entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facility. The Amendment extended the term commitment termination date under the Credit Facility with respect to term commitments entered into on the closing date to December 8, 2023. On December 15, 2023, the Borrower entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Facility. The Second Amendment increased the total revolving commitments from 50.0 million to 75.0 million, increased total term commitments from 150.0 million to 225.0 million, and increased the facility margin level applicable to the borrower. The Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. As of September 30, 2024, there was 217.0 million drawn on the Credit Facility. 
 On April 19, 2024, the Fund entered into the Revolving Credit Facility that matures on April 19, 2029 and generally bears interest at either (i) term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment plus margin of 2.00 or 1.875 per annum or (ii) the prime rate plus a margin of 2.00 or 1.875 per annum, in each case subject to certain conditions. The Fund may elect either the term SOFR or prime rate at the time of drawdown. The Revolving Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding loans on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 We cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to enter into any other credit facilities on favorable terms or at all. In connection with any other credit facilities or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may ask to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. Borrowings under the Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are considered our borrowings for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act. 
 Distributions 
 Our dividends and distributions to shareholders, if any, are determined and declared by our Board of Trustees and are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are declared considering our estimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to shareholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in the current year. We do not have a policy to pay distributions at a specific level and expect to continue to distribute substantially all of our taxable income. We cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.

_____________________________________________ 
 (1) Class D commenced operations on August 1, 2024. 

Tax characteristics of any distributions are reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV or Form 1042-S after the end of the calendar year. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year; 

98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and 

certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. 

We may, at our discretion, carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4 excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our shareholders. We will accrue excise tax on estimated taxable income as required. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
 64 

We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. Also, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our existing and future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of favorable RIC tax treatment. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC and may be subject to an excise tax. 
 In order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we have the ability to pay a large portion of a dividend in our common Shares instead of in cash. As long as a sufficient portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion can generally be as low as 20 and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution would be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Related Parties 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 The Fund has entered into an Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser. 

The Fund and the Investment Adviser have entered into the Sub-Advisory Agreement with the Sub-Adviser. 

The Administrator provides us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Administrator may be reimbursed by us for expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and the Administrator s administrative staff and providing, at our request and on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. The Administrator is an affiliate of the Investment Adviser. 

We have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with BlackRock and the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which each of BlackRock and the Investment Adviser has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "BlackRock". 

The Fund and the Distributor have entered into the Distribution Agreement. 

The Advisers and their affiliates, employees and associates currently do and, in the future, may manage other funds and accounts. The Advisers and their affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds or accounts. Accordingly, conflicts may arise regarding the allocation of investments or opportunities among us and those accounts. In general, the Advisers will allocate investment opportunities pro rata among us and the other funds and accounts (assuming the investment satisfies the objectives of each) based on the amount of committed capital each then has available. The allocation of certain investment opportunities in private placements is subject to independent director approval pursuant to the terms of the co-investment exemptive order applicable to us. In certain cases, investment opportunities may be made other than on a pro rata basis. For example, we may desire to retain an asset at the same time that one or more other funds or accounts desire to sell it or we may not have additional capital to invest at a time the other funds or accounts do. If the Advisers are unable to manage our investments effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective. In addition, the Advisers may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and certain other entities that could impact our investment returns. While our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted under the 1940 Act, we have received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting certain affiliated investments subject to certain conditions. As a result, we may face conflict of interests and investments made pursuant to the exemptive order conditions which could in certain circumstances affect adversely the price paid or received by us or the availability or size of the position purchased or sold by us. 
 Recent Developments 
 On October 1, 2024, the Fund accepted 38,173,458 of additional subscriptions, to purchase 28,205,458 of additional Institutional shares, 6,968,000 of additional Class S shares and 3,000,000 of additional Class D shares, par value 0.001 per share. On October 21, 2024, the number of shares being purchased was fixed when the purchase price of 24.7717 per Institutional, Class S shares and Class D shares were determined by the Fund. As a result, the Fund issued 1,138,616 Institutional shares, 281,289 Class S shares and 121,106 Class D shares and received 38,173,458 in proceeds.

 On October 30, 2024, the Board of Trustees of the Fund appointed Philip Tseng to the Board of Trustees of the Fund and appointed him as Chair of the Board of Trustees, each effective as of the close of business on January 31, 2025. Mr. Tseng is a Managing Director of BlackRock, Inc. Mr. Tseng serves on the Board of Directors of BlackRock Direct Lending Corp. BDLC and BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. TCPC ). Mr. Tseng currently serves as President of the Fund, TCPC and BDLC. Effective as of the close of business on November 6, 2024, Mr. Tseng will cease to serve as the President of the Fund, TCPC and BDLC and will start to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Fund, TCPC and BDLC. Mr. Tseng also was named Chair of the Board of BDLC and TCPC, each effective as of the close of business on November 6, 2024. 
 On November 1, 2024, the Fund priced its private offering of 125 million aggregate principal amount of notes comprised of 70 million of 7.14 senior unsecured notes due November 18, 2027 (the Tranche A Notes and 55 million of 7.33 senior unsecured notes due January 22, 2030 (the Tranche B Notes , and together with the Tranche A Notes, Notes ). The Tranche A Notes are expected to be issued on or around November 18, 2024 and the Tranche B Notes are expected to be issued on or around January 22, 2025, in each case subject to customary closing conditions. 
 On November 4, 2024, the Fund entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Revolving Credit Facility (the First Amendment with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent, and the lenders and issuing banks from time to time parties thereto. The First Amendment increased the total revolving commitments from 75.0 million to 150.0 million, while maintaining all other terms of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement entered on April 19, 2024. 
 66 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, 99.9 of debt investments in our portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR, or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months. At September 30, 2024, the percentage of floating rate debt investments in our portfolio that were subject to an interest rate floor was 82.0 . Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income (excluding the related incentive fee impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments and the fact that our assets and liabilities may not have the same base rate period as assumed in this table) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the period covered by this report, we, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on our evaluation, our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of material information about us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, are based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 (e)	Co-Investments . The Fund may not co-invest with any account managed by the Adviser or its affiliated persons in any Investment except in accordance with applicable law, including any exemptive order applicable to the Fund. 
 5.	Brokerage . 
 (a)	The Adviser shall effect all purchases and sales of securities in a manner consistent with the principles of best execution, taking into account net price (including commissions) and execution capability and other services which the broker or other intermediary may provide. In this regard, the Adviser may effect transactions which cause the Fund to pay a commission in excess of a commission which another broker or other intermediary would have charged; provided , however , that the Adviser shall have first determined that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage or research services performed by that 
 3 

broker or other intermediary or that the Fund is the sole beneficiary of the services paid for by such broker or other intermediary. 
 (b)	All Front End Fees (as defined in the Declaration) shall be reasonable and shall not exceed 18 of the gross proceeds of any offering and sale of the Fund s shares, regardless of the source of payment.

 (c)	The Adviser shall cause the Fund to commit at least 82 of the gross proceeds of any offering and sale of the Fund s shares towards the investment or reinvestment of assets and reserves. The remaining proceeds may be used to pay Front End Fees. 
 6.	 Compensation . 
 (a)	The Adviser, for its services to the Fund, will be entitled to receive a management fee (the Base Management Fee from the Fund and an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee ). The Base Management Fee will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.25 of the value of the Fund s net assets and payable monthly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, net assets means the Fund s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For the first calendar month in which the Fund has operations, net assets will be measured as the beginning net assets as of the date on which the Fund first issues common shares to one or more investors (other than the Adviser and its affiliates) (the Commencement Date ). Subsequently, the Base Management Fee will be calculated based on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar month. The Base Management Fees for any partial month will be appropriately pro rated. 
 (b)	For purposes of this Agreement, the total assets of the Fund shall be calculated pursuant to the procedures adopted by the Board for calculating the value of the Fund s assets. 
 (c)	The Incentive Fee will consist of two components. Each component of the Incentive Fee will be calculated and, if due, paid quarterly in arrears. 
 (d)	The income component of the Incentive Fee is calculated as follows: 
 The income component of the incentive fee will be the amount, if positive, equal to 12.5 of the aggregate net investment income before incentive compensation earned for the most recent calendar quarter and the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the fund), less aggregate income incentive compensation previously paid in with respect to the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant trailing twelve quarters. 
 The income component of the incentive fee is subject to a 5.0 total return hurdle on daily weighted average unreturned capital contributions (the Hurdle Rate ). As such, the Fund will not be obligated to pay any income incentive fee to the extent the annualized trailing twelve quarter (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since the commencement of the fund) total return of the Fund (as defined below), including net realized gains and losses and net unrealized appreciation and depreciation, does not exceed the Hurdle Rate. To the extent that the Fund s annualized total return for the relevant period exceeds the Hurdle Rate, but is less than 5.714286 of daily weighted average unreturned capital contributions, the income incentive fee will be subject to a catch up , calculated as 100 of the aggregate net investment income before incentive compensation earned in excess of Hurdle Rate for the relevant period. To the extent that the Fund s annualized total return for the relevant period exceeds 5.714286 , the income component of the incentive fee will be equal to 12.5 of net investment income before incentive compensation earned in excess of this total return threshold. 
 (e)	The capital gains component of the Incentive Fee is calculated as follows: 
 4 

The capital gains component of the incentive fee will be the amount, if positive, equal to the lesser of (i) 12.5 of the aggregate realized capital gains (computed net of realized losses and net of unrealized capital depreciation, if any) for the most recent calendar quarter and the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the fund), less capital gains incentive compensation previously paid or distributed in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant trailing twelve quarters or (ii) 12.5 of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains (computed net of realized losses and net of unrealized capital depreciation, if any) since commencement of the Fund, less capital gains incentive compensation previously paid or distributed since commencement of the Fund. The capital gains component will be paid in full prior to payment of the ordinary income component. 
 (f)	In any case, incentive compensation (including both the income and capital gains components) will only be paid to the extent the trailing twelve quarter (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the fund) total return of the Fund after incentive compensation and including such payment would equal or exceed a 5 annual total return on daily weighted average unreturned contributed capital contributions for such period. 
 (g)	For purposes of the foregoing computations and the total return limitation: 
 (i)	 net investment income before incentive compensation means the Fund s interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies) during the period, minus the Fund s operating expenses during the period (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreements, any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock), plus increases and minus decreases in net assets not treated as components of income, operating expense, gain, loss, appreciation or depreciation and not treated as changes in unreturned capital contributions, and without reduction for any incentive compensation and any organization or offering costs, in each case determined on an accrual and consolidated basis. 
 (ii)	 total return means the amount equal to the combination of net investment income before incentive compensation, realized capital gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation of the Fund for the period, in each case determined on an accrual and consolidated basis. 
 (iii)	 unreturned capital contributions means the proceeds to the Fund of all issuances of common shares, less all distributions by the Fund to the holders of common shares representing a return of capital. 
 7.	 Expenses . The Fund will be responsible for paying the compensation of the Adviser.

 10.	 Indemnification .

 8 

2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) nor parties to the proceeding (the Disinterested Non-Party Trustees that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification, or (2) if such quorum is not obtainable or even if obtainable, if a majority so directs, independent legal counsel in a written opinion that concludes that the Indemnified Person should be entitled to indemnification.

All determinations to make advance payments in connection with the expense of defending any proceeding shall be authorized and made in accordance with the succeeding paragraph (c) below. 
 (b)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Fund shall not provide any indemnification of any person acting as a broker-dealer for the Fund, or an Indemnified Person pursuant to paragraph (a) above, for any liabilities arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws by such Indemnified Person unless one or more of the following conditions are met: (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the Indemnified Person, (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the Indemnified Person or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against the Indemnified Person and finds that indemnification of the settlement and the related costs should be made, and the court considering the request for indemnification has been advised of the position of the SEC and of the published position of any state securities regulatory authority in which securities were offered or sold as to indemnification for violations of securities laws. 
 (c)	The Fund shall make advance payments in connection with the expenses of defending any action with respect to which indemnification might be sought hereunder if the Fund receives a written affirmation by the Indemnified Person of the Indemnified Person s good faith belief that the standards of conduct necessary for indemnification have been met and a written undertaking to reimburse the Fund unless it is subsequently determined that he or she is entitled to such indemnification and if a majority of the Trustees determine that the applicable standards of conduct necessary for indemnification appear to have been met. In addition, at least one of the following conditions must be met: (i) the Indemnified Person shall provide adequate security for his or her undertaking, (ii) the Fund shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful advances, or (iii) a majority of a quorum of the Disinterested Non-Party Trustees, or if a majority vote of such quorum so direct, independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall conclude, based on a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there is substantial reason to believe that the Indemnified Person ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding the above, the Fund shall not make advance payments in connection with the expenses of defending any action against an Indemnified Person with respect to which indemnification might be sought hereunder if such action against an Indemnified Person was commenced by at least 66 2/3 of the outstanding common shares of the Fund that are not held by affiliated persons of the Adviser. 
 (d)	The rights accruing to any Indemnified Person under these provisions shall not exclude any other right to which he or she may be lawfully entitled.

 12.	 Term of Agreement; Events Affecting the Adviser; Survival of Certain Terms . 
 (a)	This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and, unless sooner terminated by the Fund or Adviser as provided herein, shall continue in effect for a period of two years.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated by the Fund at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon giving the Adviser 60 days notice (which notice may be waived by the Adviser), provided that such termination by the Fund shall be directed or approved by the vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Fund in office at the time or by the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting securities of the Fund at the time outstanding and entitled to vote, or by the Adviser on 120 days written notice (which notice may be waived by the Fund). 
 (b)	This Agreement will also immediately terminate in the event of its assignment. As used in this Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting securities, interested person and assignment shall have the same meanings as such terms are given in the 1940 Act.

The 
 10 

Adviser agrees that, notwithstanding any termination, it will reasonably cooperate in any proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, any other agreement of which the Fund is subject or any Investment (excluding any such proceeding in which claims are asserted against the Adviser or any affiliated person of the Adviser) upon receipt of appropriate indemnification and expense reimbursement. 
 (e)	Subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, upon termination of this Agreement the Fund may, but is not required to, terminate the Adviser s interest, if any, in the Fund s revenues, expenses, income, losses, distributions and capital by payment of an amount equal to the then present fair market value of the terminated Adviser s interest, determined by agreement of the terminated Adviser and the Fund, which method of payment to the terminated Adviser must be fair and must protect the solvency and liquidity of the Fund, consistent with Section II.E.3 of the NASAA Omnibus Guidelines.
