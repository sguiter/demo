 The Company is not registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Company has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act CEA ), pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA. The Company is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. 
 Hercules Capital IV, L.P. HC IV is our wholly owned Delaware limited partnership that was formed in December 2010. HC IV received a license to operate as a Small Business Investment Company SBIC under the authority of the Small Business Administration SBA on October 27, 2020. In September 2023, the Company formed Hercules SBIC V, L.P. SBIC V which received its SBIC license on July 9, 2024. SBICs are subject to a variety of regulations concerning, among other things, the size and nature of the companies in which they may invest and the structure of those investments. Hercules Technology SBIC Management, LLC, is a wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of the Company, which was formed in November 2003 and serves as the general partner of HC IV and SBIC V. 
 The Company has also established certain wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are structured as Delaware corporations or Limited Liability Companies LLCs ), to hold portfolio companies organized as LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities). These subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Certain of the subsidiaries are taxable and not consolidated with Hercules for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments.

 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification, as amended ASC ). As provided under Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 946, the Company will not consolidate its investment in a portfolio company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Rather, an investment company s interest in portfolio companies that are not investment companies should be measured at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 946. The Adviser Subsidiary is not an investment company as defined in ASC Topic 946 and further, the Adviser Subsidiary provides investment advisory services exclusively to the Adviser Funds which are owned by External Parties. As such pursuant to ASC Topic 946, the Adviser Subsidiary is accounted for as a portfolio investment of the Company held at fair value and is not consolidated. 
 Financial statements prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income, expenses, gains and losses during the reported periods. Changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets, the credit worthiness of our portfolio companies, other macro-economic developments (for example, global pandemics, natural disasters, terrorism, international conflicts and war), and any other parameters used in determining these estimates and assumptions could cause actual results to differ from these estimates and assumptions.

of the Company s total assets represented investments in portfolio companies whose fair value is determined in good faith by the Company's Valuation Committee and approved by the Board. Fair Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value is as determined in good faith by the valuation designee of the Board. The Company s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with ASC Topic 820. The Company provides financing solutions to high-growth and innovative venture capital-backed and institutional-backed companies in technology-related industries including drug discovery and development, software, consumer business services, and other healthcare services at all stages of development. Given the nature of investing in these types of businesses, substantially all of the Company s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there generally is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. As such, the Company values substantially all of its investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to a consistent valuation policy established by the Board in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 820 and the 1940 Act. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments determined in good faith by the Company's Valuation Committee and approved by the Board may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.

The Company determines the fair value of these Liability Awards based on the expected probability of the performance conditions being met and recognized over the service period. The Company accrues for Liability Awards based on the expected probability that the performance conditions would be met, this assumption is re-evaluated each period, and may be adjusted to reflect changes in this assumption. Generally, the other Liability Awards vest over a service term. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of compensation expense related to the Liability Awards recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and no amounts remain outstanding. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million and Liability Awards vested, respectively. 
 million of total unrecognized compensation costs expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was approximately million of compensation expense related to the Liability Awards recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and million accrued within Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

 Certain premises are leased or licensed under agreements which expire at various dates through July 2034. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total rent expense, including short-term leases, amounted to approximately million and million in each period, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total rent expense, including short-term leases, amounted to approximately million and million in each period, respectively. The Company recognizes an operating lease liability and a ROU asset for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The lease payments on short-term leases are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis. The discount rate applied to measure each ROU asset and lease liability is based on the Company s incremental weighted average cost of debt. The Company considers the general economic environment and its credit rating and factors in various financing and asset specific adjustments to ensure the discount rate applied is appropriate to the intended use of the underlying lease. While some of the leases contained options to extend and terminate, it is not reasonably certain that either option will be utilized and therefore, only the payments in the initial term of the leases were included in the lease liability and ROU asset.

 Overview 
 We are a leading specialty finance company with a focus on providing financing solutions to high-growth and innovative venture capital-backed and institutional-backed companies in a variety of technology and life sciences industries. Our primary business objectives are to increase our net income, net investment income, and net asset value through our investments. We principally invest in debt securities and, to a lesser extent, equity securities, with a particular emphasis on Structured Debt. We use the term Structured Debt to refer to a debt investment that is structured with an equity, warrant, option, or other right to purchase or convert into common or preferred stock. We aim to achieve our business objectives by maximizing our portfolio total return through generation of current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our warrant and equity investments. We expect that our investments will generally range from 25.0 million to 100.0 million, although we may make investments in amounts above or below this range. Through generation of current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our warrant and equity investments, we aim to maximize our portfolio total return. 
 Since inception through September 30, 2024 , we have originated more than 21.0 billion in commitments in over 660 companies. We, our subsidiaries or our affiliates, may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. As of September 30, 2024, Hercules and its Adviser Subsidiary actively manage approximately 4.6 billion of assets. 
 We are structured as an internally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, which includes securities of private U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Consistent with requirements under the 1940 Act, we invest primarily in United States based companies and to a lesser extent in foreign companies. We source our investments through our principal office located in San Mateo, CA, as well as through our additional offices in Boston, MA, New York, NY, Bethesda, MD, San Diego, CA, Denver, CO, and London, United Kingdom. 
 We have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to qualify as a RIC, among other requirements, we must maintain certain income, asset, and distribution requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the income that we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to our stockholders provided that we maintain our RIC status for a given year. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 The total fair value of our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows: 
 (in millions) Fair Value September 30, 2024 
 December 31, 2023 
 Debt 3,380.6 3,057.3 Equity 143.0 152.2 Warrants 30.0 33.9 Investment Funds Vehicles 6.9 4.6 Total Investment Portfolio 3,560.5 3,248.0 
 Our investments in portfolio companies take a variety of forms, including unfunded contractual commitments and funded investments. Not all debt commitments represent future cash requirements. Unfunded contractual commitments depend upon a portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment is available to the portfolio company, which is expected to affect our funding levels. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Debt commitments generally fund over the following year from underwriting. From time to time, unfunded contractual commitments may expire without being drawn and thus do not represent future cash requirements. 
 Prior to entering into a contractual commitment, we generally issue a non-binding term sheet to a prospective portfolio company. Non-binding term sheets are subject to completion of our due diligence and final investment committee approval process, as well as the negotiation of definitive documentation with the prospective portfolio companies. These non-binding term sheets generally convert to contractual commitments in approximately 90 days from signing and some portion may be assigned or allocated to or directly originated by the Adviser Funds prior to or after closing. Not all non-binding term sheets are expected to close and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

 Macroeconomic Market Developments 
 The capital markets are subject to fluctuations caused by various external factors such as changes in the inflationary environment, interest rate movements, concerns over slowing economic growth and possible global recession, uncertainty and disruption caused by geopolitical events, including the conflicts in Ukraine, Russia, and the Middle East, among other factors. These m acroeconomic developments are outside our control and could require us to adjust our plan of operations, and impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. We monitor macroeconomic market developments and their related impact to our business, including impacts to our portfolio companies, employees, due diligence and underwriting processes, and the broader financial markets. 
 Our investment portfolio continues to be focused on industries and sectors that are generally expected to be more resilient to U.S. and global economic cycles. This includes being partially insulated from declining interest rates as all of our floating rate debt investments, which represent 97.3 and 95.9 of our debt portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and

Table of Contents 

 December 31, 2023, respectively, are subject to interest rate floors. While our portfolio is not immune to the impact of macroeconomic events, we and our portfolio are well positioned to manage the current environment. Given the unpredictability and fluidity of the macroeconomic market, neither our management nor our Board is able to predict the full impact of the macroeconomic events on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
 Income from Portfolio 
 We primarily generate revenue in the form of interest income, from our investments in debt securities, and fee income, which is primarily comprised of commitment and facility fees. Interest income is recognized in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Fees generated in connection with our debt investments are recognized over the life of the loan or, in some cases, recognized as earned. In addition, we generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. We also generate revenue in the form of capital gains, if any, on warrants or other equity securities that we acquire from our portfolio companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt investments generally have a term of between two and five years and typically bear interest at a rate ranging from approximately 8.0 to approximately 17.7 . In addition to the cash yields received on our debt investments, in some instances, our debt investments may also include any of the following: exit fees, balloon payment fees, commitment fees, success fees, PIK provisions or prepayment fees which may be required to be included in income prior to receipt. 
 Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, with amortization of principal typically occurring over the term of the investment. In addition, our loans may include an interest-only period ranging from three to eighteen months or longer. In limited instances in which we choose to defer amortization of the loan for a period of time from the date of the initial investment, the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest become due at the maturity date. 
 Loan origination and commitment fees are generally received in full at the inception of a loan are deferred and amortized into fee income as an enhancement to the related loan s yield over the contractual life of the loan. We recognize nonrecurring fees amortized over the remaining term of the loan commencing in the quarter relating to specific loan modifications. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unamortized capitalized fee income was recorded as follows:

 Included within debt investment cost 37.0 35.9 Deferred receivable related to expired commitments 3.4 4.3 Total Exit Fees Receivable 40.4 40.2 
 Additionally, we have debt investments in our portfolio that earn PIK interest. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is recorded as interest income and added to the principal balance of the loan on specified capitalization dates. To maintain our status as a RIC, the non-cash PIK income must be distributed to stockholders with other sources of income in the form of dividend distributions even though we have not yet collected any cash from the borrower. Amounts necessary to pay these distributions may come from available cash or the liquidation of certain investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded approximately 12.7 million and 6.7 million in PIK income, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded approximately 37.9 million and 18.0 million in PIK income, respectively. 
 Portfolio Yield 
 We report our financial results on a GAAP basis. We monitor the performance of our total investment portfolio and total debt portfolio using both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, we evaluate performance through monitoring the portfolio yields as we consider them to be effective indicators, for both management and stockholders, of 
 75 

Table of Contents 

 the financial performance of our total investment portfolio and total debt portfolio. The key metrics that we monitor with respect to yields are as described below: 
 Total Yield - The total yield is derived by dividing GAAP basis Total investment income by the weighted average GAAP basis value of investment portfolio assets outstanding during the year, including non-interest earning assets such as warrants and equity investments at amortized cost. 
 Effective Yield on total debt investments - The effective yield is derived by dividing GAAP basis Total investment income from debt investments (1) by the weighted average GAAP basis value of debt investment portfolio assets at amortized cost outstanding during the year. 
 Core Yield on total debt investments The core yield is a Non-GAAP financial measure. The core yield is derived by dividing Core investment income from debt investments by the weighted average GAAP basis value of debt investment portfolio assets at amortized cost outstanding during the year. Core investment income adjusts GAAP basis Total investment income from debt investments (1) to exclude fee and other income accelerations attributed to early payoffs, deal restructuring, loan modifications, and other one-time income events, but includes income from expired commitments. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Total Yield 13.8 14.7 Effective Yield (1) 
 14.4 15.5 Core Yield (Non-GAAP) (1) 
 13.3 14.2 
 (1) Yield calculated using Total investment income excluding bank interest, dividend income, and investment income from other assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We believe that these measures are useful for our stockholders as it provides further insight into the yield of our portfolio to allow a more meaningful comparison with our competitors. As noted above, Core Yield, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is derived by dividing Core investment income, as defined above, by the weighted average GAAP basis value of debt investment portfolio assets at amortized cost outstanding. The reconciliation to calculate Core investment income from GAAP basis 'Total investment income' are as follows: 
 (in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 GAAP Basis: 
 Total investment income 
 125,248 116,744 Less: fee and income accelerations attributed to early payoffs, restructuring, loan modifications, and other one-time events except income from expired commitments (9,160) (9,378) Non-GAAP Basis: 
 Core investment income 
 116,088 107,366 Less: bank interest income, dividend income, and other investment income from other assets (2,831) (903) Core investment income from debt portfolio 113,257 106,463 
 We believe the Core Yield is useful for our investors as it provides the yield at which our debt investments are originated and eliminates one-off items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, thereby allowing for a more meaningful comparison over time. 
 Although the Core Yield, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is intended to enhance our stockholders understanding of our performance, the Core Yield should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to the GAAP financial metrics presented. The aforementioned Non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
 Another financial measure that we monitor is the total return for our investors, which was approximately 26.8 and 36.1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total return equals the change in the ending market value over the beginning of the period price per share plus distributions paid per share during the period, divided by the beginning price assuming the distribution is reinvested on the date of the distribution. The total return does not reflect any sales load that may be paid by investors. See Note 10 Financial Highlights included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.

 Portfolio Composition 
 Our portfolio companies are primarily privately held companies and public companies which are active in sectors characterized by high margins, high growth rates, consolidation and product and market extension opportunities. 
 The following table presents the fair value of the Company s portfolio by industry sector as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 (1) See Note 4 Investments for complete list of industry sectors and corresponding amounts of investments at fair value as a percentage of the total portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value as a percentage of total portfolio does not exceed 5.0 for any individual industry sector other than Drug Discovery Development , Software , "Healthcare Services, Other", or Consumer Business Services . 
 Industry and sector concentrations vary as new loans are recorded and loans are paid off. Investment income, consisting of interest, fees, and recognition of gains on equity and warrants or other equity interests, can fluctuate materially when a loan is paid off or a warrant or equity interest is sold . Investment income recognized in any given year can be highly concentrated in several portfolio companies. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our ten largest portfolio companies represented approximately 30.6 and 29.7 of the total fair value of our investments in portfolio companies, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had five and five investments that represented 5 or more of our net assets, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had four and five equity investments, respectively, that represented 5 or more of the total fair value of the Company s equity investments. These equity investments represented approximately 52.9 and 56.5 of the total fair value of the Company s equity investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 97.3 and 95.9 of the debt investment portfolio was priced at floating interest rates or floating interest rates with a Prime, SOFR, or BSBY-based interest rate floor, respectively. Changes in interest rates, including Prime, SOFR, or BSBY rates, may affect the interest income and the value of our investment portfolio for portfolio investments with floating rates. 
 Our investments in Structured Debt generally have detachable equity enhancement features in the form of warrants or other equity securities designed to provide us with an opportunity for capital appreciation. These features are treated as OID and are accreted into interest income over the term of the loan as a yield enhancement. Our warrant coverage generally ranges from 3 to 20 of the principal amount invested in a portfolio company, with a strike price generally equal to the most recent equity financing round. As of September 30, 2024, we held warrants in 98 portfolio companies, with a fair value of approximately 30.0 million. The fair value of our warrant portfolio decreased by approximately 3.9 million, as compared to a fair value of 33.9 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily related to the decrease in fair value of the portfolio companies. 
 Our existing warrant holdings would require us to invest approximately 61.4 million to exercise such warrants as of September 30, 2024. Warrants may appreciate or depreciate in value depending largely upon the underlying portfolio company s performance and overall market conditions. As attractive investment opportunities arise, we may exercise certain of our warrants to purchase stock, and could ultimately monetize our investments. Of the warrants that we have monetized since inception, we have realized multiples in the range of approximately 1.02x to 42.71x based on the historical rate of return on our investments. We may also experience losses from our warrant portfolio in the event that warrants are terminated or expire unexercised.

 Portfolio Grading 
 We use an investment grading system, which grades each debt investment on a scale of 1 to 5 to characterize and monitor our expected level of risk on the debt investments in our portfolio with 1 being the highest quality. The following table shows the distribution of our outstanding debt investments on the 1 to 5 investment grading scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our debt investments had a weighted average investment grading of 2.24 and 2.24 on a cost basis, respectively. Changes in a portfolio company's investment grading may be a result of changes in portfolio company's performance and/or timing of expected liquidity events. For instance, we may downgrade a portfolio company if it is not meeting our financing criteria or are underperforming relative to their respective business plans. We may also downgrade a portfolio company as it approaches a point in time when it will require additional equity capital to continue operations. Conversely, we may upgrade a portfolio company's investment grading when it is exceeding our financial performance expectations and/or is expected to mature/repay in full due to a liquidity event. The overall downgrade of the portfolio's weighted average investment grading is reflective of the impact of current macroeconomic environment. 
 As macroeconomic events evolve and cause disruption in the capital markets and to businesses, we are continuing to monitor and work with the management teams and stakeholders of our portfolio companies to navigate the significant market, operational, and economic challenges created by these events. This includes remaining proactive in our assessments of credit performance to manage potential risks across our investment portfolio. 
 Non-accrual Investments 
 The following table shows the amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amortized Cost Percentage of Total Portfolio at Amortized Cost

 Debt investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest, or fees will not be collected according to contractual terms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, we cease to recognize interest and fee income until the portfolio company has paid all principal and interest due or demonstrated the ability to repay our current and future contractual obligations. We may not apply the non-accrual status to a loan where the investment has sufficient collateral value to collect all of the contractual amount due and is in the process of collection. Interest collected on non-accrual investments are generally applied to principal.

 Our operating results can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors, including changes in the level of investments held, changes in our investment yields, recognition of realized gains and losses, and changes in net unrealized appreciation and depreciation, among other factors. As a result, comparison of the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful. 
 Investment Income 
 Total investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 125.2 million and 371.8 million, respectively as compared to approximately 116.7 million and 338.1 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investment income is primarily composed of interest income earned on our debt investments, fee income from commitments, facilities, and other loan related fees and dividend income distributions. 
 Interest and Dividend Income

 (52) Ending PIK interest receivable balance 62,611 39,262 
 The increase in PIK interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due to an increase in the weighted average principal outstanding for debt investments which earn PIK interest. Payments on PIK loans are normally received only in the event of payoffs. The PIK receivable for September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was approximately 2 and 1 of total debt investments, respectively. 
 Fee Income 
 Fee income from commitment, facility and loan related fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 6.2 million and 19.4 million, respectively as compared to approximately 6.4 million and 18.8 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Fee income was relatively consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in fee income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average principal and an increase in expired commitments. 
 Fee income is comprised of recurring fee income from commitment, facility, and loan related fees, fee income due to expired commitments, and acceleration of fee income due to early loan repayments during the period. The following table summarizes the components of fee income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 In certain investment transactions, we may earn income from advisory services; however, we ha d no income fro m advisory services in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are comprised of interest and fees on our debt borrowings, general and administrative expenses, taxes, and employee compensation and benefits. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net operating expenses totaled approximately 42.1 million and 40.0 million , respectively for the three-month periods, and approximately 127.1 million and 120.1 million, respectively for the nine-month periods. 
 Interest and Fees on our Debt 
 Interest and fees on our debt totaled approximately 22.4 million and 19.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 63.9 million and 57.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our higher weighted average borrowings outstanding and cost of debt during 
 80 

Table of Contents 

 both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, resulted in an increase of interest and fee expenses as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our weighted average cost of debt was approximately 5.1 and 4.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 5.0 and 4.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average cost of debt includes interest and fees on our debt but excludes the impact of fee accelerations due to the extinguishment of debt, as applicable. The increase in the weighted average cost of debt during 2024 as compared to 2023, was attributable to increased usage of our Credit Facilities which are floating rate instruments and have a higher borrowing rate. 
 General and Administrative Expenses and Tax Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include legal fees, consulting fees, accounting fees, printer fees, insurance premiums, rent, expenses associated with the workout of underperforming investments, and various other expenses. Our general and administrative expenses stayed flat at 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and increased to 14.1 million from 13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs of office and technology expenses, and certain professional fees. Tax expenses were 2.0 million and 1.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 4.5 million and 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our tax expenses primarily relate to excise tax accruals. 
 Employee Compensation 
 Employee compensation and benefits totaled approximately 12.1 million and 42.9 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 13.6 million and 41.1 million respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The movement between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to fluctuations in variable compensation. 
 Employee stock-based compensation totaled approximately 3.2 million and 9.7 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 3.3 million and 9.8 million respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was no significant change between the comparative periods . 
 Expenses allocated to the Adviser Subsidiary 
 The shared services agreement with the Adviser Subsidiary (the Sharing Agreement ), provides the Adviser Subsidiary access to our human capital resources, including deal professionals, finance, and administrative functions, as well as other resources including infrastructure assets such as office space and technology. Under the terms of the Sharing Agreement, we allocate the related expenses of shared services to the Adviser Subsidiary. Our total net operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are net of expenses allocated to the Adviser Subsidiary of 2.2 million and 2.4 million, respectively and 7.9 million and 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in expenses allocated to the Adviser Subsidiary for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is due t o lower allocations to the Adviser Funds. The increase in expenses allocated to the Adviser Subsidiary for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is due to a result of higher average assets under management and higher allocations to the Adviser Funds. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was less than 0.1 million and approximately 0.1 million due from the Adviser Subsidiary, respectively. 
 Net Realized Gains and Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation 
 Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of an investment without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized loss on debt extinguishment relates to additional fees, costs, and accelerated recognition of remaining debt issuance costs, which are recognized in the event debt is extinguished before its stated maturity. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net realized loss of 0.6 million and a net realized gain of 1.8 million, respectively. The net realized gains (losses) were generated from gross realized gains of 2.8 million and 17.8 million respectively, for the three and nine month periods, primarily from the sale of our equity and warrant positions in Palantir Technologies, TransMedics Group, Inc., Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., DoorDash, Inc., and sale proceeds from the completed acquisition of Delphix Corp. Our gains were offset by gross realized losses of 3.3 million and 15.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine month periods, from the write-off of equity and warrant investments in Proterra, Inc., The Faction Group LLC, Udacity, Inc., Humanigen, Inc., Eigen Technologies Ltd., ADMA Biologics, Inc., Sio Gene Therapies, Inc., Fulcrum Bioenergy, Inc., PDS Biotechnology Corporation, Polyera Corporation, Intuity Medical, Inc., and The Neat Company which had no value after the respective portfolio companies were acquired or dissolved. Additionally, we realized a loss of 9.1 million from write-off of our debt investments relating to Better Therapeutics, Inc. and Eigen Technologies Ltd., net of recovered collections of 6.0 million. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net realized loss of 2.6 million and a net realized gain of 5.5 million, respectively. The net realized gains (losses) were generated from gross realized gains of 3.7 million and 23.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine month periods, primarily from the sale of our equity and warrant positions in Palantir Technologies, Provention Bio, Inc., TransMedics Group, Inc., Sprinklr, Inc., and Zeta Global Corp. Our gains were offset by gross realized losses of 6.3 million and 18.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine month periods, primarily from the write-off of equity and warrant investments in Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Fungible, Inc. which had no value after the respective portfolio companies were acquired, the write-off of our equity investments in Gynesonics, Inc., Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Flowonix Medical Inc. as a result of capital markets transactions. Additionally, we realized a net 5.4 million loss from write-off of our debt investments in Codiak Biosciences, Inc. and Esme Learning Solutions, Inc., net of recovered collections of 17.5 million. 
 The net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation of our investments is derived from the changes in fair value of each investment determined in good faith by our Valuation Committee and approved by the Board. The following table summarizes the change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Income and Excise Taxes 
 We account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, under which income taxes are provided for amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred based upon the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax law. Valuation allowances may be used to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount likely to be realized. We intend to timely distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our annual taxable income for each year, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and, depending upon the level of taxable income earned in a year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable U.S. federal excise tax. 
 Because federal income tax regulations differ from U.S. GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Permanent differences may also result from the classification of certain items, such as the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 
 The Adviser Subsidiary 
 Hercules Capital Management LLC through the Adviser Subsidiary has entered into investment management agreements (the IMAs with the Adviser Funds. Pursuant to the IMAs, the Adviser Subsidiary provides investment advisory and management services to the Adviser Funds in exchange for an asset-based fee. In addition, Hercules Capital Management LLC through its control of the GP Interests for each of the Adviser Funds may receive certain incentive fee allocations. The Adviser Funds are privately offered investment funds exempt from registration under the 1940 Act that invest in debt and equity investments in venture or institutionally backed technology related and life sciences companies.

Table of Contents 

 The Adviser Subsidiary receives fee income for the services provided to the Adviser Funds. The Adviser Subsidiary s contribution to our net investment income is derived from dividend income declared by the Adviser Subsidiary and interest income earned on loans to the Adviser Subsidiary. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 1.8 million and no divi dends, respectively, were declared by the Adviser Subsidiary. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 5.0 million and no dividends, respectively, were declared by the Adviser Subsidiary. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Obligations 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived from our debt borrowings and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt and the proceeds from the turnover of our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. We may also raise additional equity or debt capital through registered offerings off a shelf registration, At-the-Market ATM ), and private offerings of securities, by securitizing a portion of our investments, or by borrowing from the SBA through our SBIC subsidiaries. This Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Obligations section should be read in conjunction with the Macroeconomic Market Developments section above. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we principally funded our operations from (i) cash receipts from interest, dividend, and fee income from our investment portfolio, (ii) cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments through the repayments of debt investments and the sale of debt and equity investments, (iii) borrowings on our credit facilities, and (iv) equity offerings. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities used 88.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to 62.6 million used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 26.2 million increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a 64.5 million increase in net purchases of investments offset by a 36.8 million increase in principal, fee repayments, and proceeds from the sale of debt investments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our investing activities used approximately 700 thousand of cash, compared to 390 thousand used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 310 thousand increase in cash used in investing activities was due to an increase in purchases of capital equipment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financing activities provided 17.5 million of cash, compared to 74.3 million provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 56.8 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to a 172.0 million decrease in equity issued and a 23.8 million increase in dividend distributions, offset by an increase in net borrowing activity of 126.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we distributed dividends of 225.6 million compared to 201.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We also reduced the usage of our ATM program, which provided (net of offering costs) approximately 66.3 million and down from 238.3 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net assets totaled 1.9 billion, with a NAV per share of 11.40. We intend to continue to operate in order to generate cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. Our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to holders of our common stock. 
 Available liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 572.3 million in available liquidity, including 38.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and available borrowing capacity of approximatel y 23.4 million under the SMBC Faci lity, 175.0 mil lion under our SMBC letter of credit facility, 160.0 million under the MUFG Bank Facility, and 175.0 million of SBA Debentures, subject to certain conditions. Additional liquidity is available through accordion provisions within the terms of our Credit Facilities, through which the available borrowing capacity can be increased by an aggregate 475.0 million, subject to certain conditions. Further, the SMBC letter of credit facility may also be increased by an additional 225.0 million (up to 400.0 million), subject to certain conditions. Total amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024, were 441.0 million outstanding under our Credit Facilities, which are floating interest rate obligations, and the remaining 1,310.0 million of term debt outstanding, which are all fixed interest rate debt obligations. 
 Not considered above, as of September 30, 2024, we held 5.1 million of cash classified as restricted cash. Our restricted cash relates to amounts that are held as collateral securing certain of our financing transactions, including collections of interest and principal payments on assets that are securitized related to the 2031 Asset-Backed Notes. Based on current characteristics of the securitized debt investment portfolios, the restricted funds may be used to pay monthly interest and principal on the securitized debt with any excess distributed to us or available for our general operations.

 to Note 5 Debt included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of our debt obligations. 
 The 1940 Act permits BDCs to incur borrowings, issue debt securities, or issue preferred stock unless immediately after the borrowings or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock is less than 200 (or 150 if certain requirements are met). On September 4, 2018 and December 6, 2018, our Board, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) and our stockholders, respectively, approved the application to us of the 150 minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio under our regulatory requirements as a BDC was 217.1 excluding our SBA debentures. Our exemptive order from the SEC allows us to exclude all SBA leverage from our asset coverage ratio. As a result of the SEC exemptive order, our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 150 , which while providing increased investment flexibility, also may increase our exposure to risks associated with leverage. Total asset coverage when including our SBA debentures was 205.7 as of September 30, 2024. 
 The 1940 Act prohibits us from selling shares of our common stock at a price below the current NAV per share of such stock, with certain exceptions. One such exception is prior stockholder approval of issuances below NAV provided that our Board makes certain determinations. On August 16, 2024, we obtained authorization from our stockholders to issue common stock at a price below our then-current NAV per share for a twelve-month period which will expire on August 16, 2025. 
 As detailed above, our diverse and well-structured balance sheet is designed to provide a long-term focused and sustainable investment platform. Currently, we believe we have ample liquidity to support our near-term capital requirements. As the impact of the macro-economic events, potential global recession, acts of terrorism, war, geopolitical events, and the related disruption to markets and business continues to impact the economy, we will continue to evaluate our overall liquidity position and take proactive steps to maintain the appropriate liquidity position based upon the current circumstances. 
 Equity Offerings 
 We may from time-to-time issue and sell shares of our common stock through public or ATM offerings. We currently sell shares through our equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities LLC JMP and Jefferies LLC Jefferies (the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement entered into on May 5, 2023. The 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement provides that we may offer and sell up to 25.0 million shares of our common stock from time to time through JMP or Jefferies, as our sales agents. Sales of our common stock, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE or similar securities exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. We generally use net proceeds from these offerings to make investments, to repurchase or pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 13.6 million shares remain available for issuance and sale under the current equity distribution agreement. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold zero and 3.7 million shares of our common stock receiving total accumulated net proceeds of zero and 66.4 million, respectively. This is a decrease from the approximately 107.6 million and 238.3 million of accumulated net proceeds received from the issuance and sale of 6.5 million shares and 16.2 million shares, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Commitments and Obligations 
 Our significant cash requirements generally relate to our debt obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,751.0 million of debt outstanding, 170.0 million within the next year, 1,216.0 million within 1 to 3 years, and 365.0 million beyond 3 years. 
 In addition to our debt obligations, in the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These consist primarily of unfunded contractual commitments to extend credit, in the form of loans, to our portfolio companies. Unfunded contractual commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet. 
 Our unfunded contractual commitments may be significant from time to time. A portion of these unfunded contractual commitments are dependent upon the portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available. Furthermore, our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions which allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made unfunded commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. These commitments will be subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. 
 85 

Table of Contents 

 Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As such, our disclosure of unfunded contractual commitments includes only those which are available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by milestones. Refer to Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of our unfunded commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 489.0 million of available unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which were available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by future or unachieved milestones, as well as uncalled capital commitments to make investments in private equity funds. In order to draw a portion of the Company's available unfunded commitments, a portfolio company must submit to the Company a formal funding request that complies with the applicable advance notice and other operational requirements. The available unfunded commitments excludes unfunded commitments (i) for which, with respect to a portfolio company's agreement, a milestone was achieved after the last day on which the portfolio company could have requested a drawdown funding to be completed within the reporting period; and (ii) 152.2 million of unfunded commitments which represent the portion of portfolio company commitments assigned to or directly committed by the Adviser Funds. 
 Additionally, we had approximately 180.5 million of non-binding term sheet outstanding to five new companies and one existing company, which generally convert to contractual commitments within approximately 90 days of signing. Non-binding outstanding term sheets are subject to completion of our due diligence and final investment committee approval process, as well as the negotiation of definitive documentation with the prospective portfolio companies. Not all non-binding term sheets are expected to close and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 The fair value of our unfunded commitments is considered to be immaterial as the yield determined at the time of underwriting is expected to be materially consistent with the yield upon funding, given that interest rates are generally pegged to market indices and given the existence of milestones, conditions and/or obligations embedded in the borrowing agreements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the period reported. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in our estimates and assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Investments, Fair Valuation Measurements, Income Recognition, and Income Taxes. The valuation of investments is our most significant critical estimate. The most significant input to this estimate is the yield interest rate, which includes the hypothetical market yield plus premium or discount adjustment, used in determining the fair value of our debt investments. The following table shows the approximate increase (decrease) to the fair value of our debt investments from hypothetical change to the yield interest rates used for each valuation, assuming no other changes: 
 (in thousands) Change in unrealized 
 appreciation (depreciation) 
 Basis Point Change (100) 48,570 (50) 26,165 50 (28,321) 100 (57,107) 
 For a further discussion and disclosure of key inputs and considerations related to this estimate, refer to Note 3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments, cash and cash equivalents and idle fund investments. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates, including Prime, SOFR, and BSBY rates, to the extent our debt investments include variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 97.3 of the loans in our portfolio had variable rates based on floating Prime, SOFR, or BSBY rates with a floor. The majority of our loans are linked to the Prime rate and comprise 75.5 of the loan portfolio, and have a weighted average Prime floor of 6.9 as of September 30, 2024. Our SOFR or BSBY indexed debt investments have weighted average index floors of approximately 1.0 as of September 30, 2024. Our debt borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a floating rate, all other outstanding debt borrowings bear interest at a fixed rate. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the approximate annualized increase (decrease) in components of net assets resulting from operations of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and debt: 
 (in thousands) Interest 
 Income 
 Interest 
 Expense 
 Net 
 Income

 Basis Point Change (200) (32,024) (8,196) (23,828) (0.15) (100) (17,644) (4,098) (13,546) (0.08) (75) (13,426) (3,073) (10,353) (0.06) (50) (9,286) (2,049) (7,237) (0.04) (25) (4,873) (1,024) (3,849) (0.02) 25 5,577 1,024 4,553 0.03 50 11,586 2,049 9,537 0.06 75 18,931 3,073 15,858 0.10 
 We generally do not engage in hedging activities. From time-to-time, we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations and foreign currency by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against changes in interest rates and foreign currency, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our borrowed funds and higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have entered into a foreign currency forward to limit our foreign currency exposure with respect to the British Pound. For additional information refer to Note 4 Investments , included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 Although we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our portfolio. It also does not adjust for other business developments, including our debt borrowings and use of our Credit Facilities that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. It also does not assume any repayments from our portfolio companies. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above. 
 Because we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by variable rate assets in our investment portfolio. For additional information regarding the interest rate associated with each of our debt borrowings, refer to Item 2 - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Note 5 Debt included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s chief executive and chief financial officers, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, conducted an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company s chief executive and chief financial officers have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s chief executive and chief financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.
