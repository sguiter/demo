The estimated carrying value and fair value of the Company s Term Loan Facility, as defined and further described in Note 8, was determined using available market information based on recent trades or activity of debt instruments with substantially similar risks, terms and maturities, which fall within Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value of the Company s Convertible Notes, as defined and further described in Note 8, was determined based on the last traded price of the Convertible Notes for the period ended September 30, 2024, and falls under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: 

Foreign exchange forward contracts-balance sheet hedges 

For both periods presented in the table, the Japanese yen and the South Korean won were the largest notional contracts for designated cash flow hedges, and the Euro was the largest notional contract for balance sheet hedges not designated as a hedging instrument. Net Investment Hedges On January 1, 2023, the Company designated certain Euro-denominated debt as a net investment hedge to hedge a portion of its net investments in certain of its entities with functional currencies denominated in the Euro. On January 22, 2024, the Company prepaid its USD Tranche A in full using, in part, a incremental borrowing under its Euro Tranche B, each as defined and further described in Note 8. On January 22, 2024, the Company designated the additional of its Euro Tranche B as a net investment hedge. As of September 30, 2024, the total principal amount outstanding under its Euro Tranche B was and the entire balance was designated as a net investment hedge. As of December 31, 2023 , the total principal amount outstanding under its Euro Tranche B was and the entire balance was designated as a net investment hedge. For these net investment hedges, the Company records foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses within a

 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company acquired USD London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR interest rate cap agreements as a result of its acquisition of Atotech Limited Atotech on (the Atotech Acquisition and had utilized these agreements to offset Term SOFR on its Term Loan Facility. The notional value of the agreements was as of December 31, 2023 and expired on . Effective June 30, 2023, the Company s USD LIBOR based interest rate caps were converted to Term SOFR. The Company also had USD LIBOR based swaps that were converted to Term SOFR, effective June 30, 2023. The conversions from USD LIBOR to Term SOFR did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations. The interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in OCI. To the extent these arrangements are no longer effective hedges, the hedging relationship will be discontinued and changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments from the last assessment period that were effective up to the current period will be recorded immediately in earnings. Amounts previously recorded in OCI will remain in OCI and will be reclassified to earnings when the interest payments impact consolidated earnings. If the Company determines that the interest payments are unlikely to occur, amounts previously recorded in OCI will be reclassified to earnings immediately. Changes in the fair value of interest rate caps were recorded immediately in earnings, as the Company did not designate these instruments as hedges and therefore these instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting. The cash flows resulting from interest rate agreements are classified in cash flows from operating activities.)

In addition, the Company used an income approach to determine the fair value of the long-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets within these reporting units (Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy). These valuations resulted in a fair value and impairment of completed technology within the equipment solutions reporting unit and a fair value and impairment of in-process research and development IPR D within the electronics reporting unit. After evaluating forecast updates and carrying values, the Company did not identify impairments at any other of its reporting units. For the completed technology valuation within the equipment solutions reporting unit, the forecasted future undiscounted cash flows were consistent with the Company s goodwill analysis, using an approximate useful life, an weighted-average forecasted revenue growth rate, and a discount rate of .

Total stock-based compensation expense 

At September 30, 2024 , the total compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees and directors under the Plans that had not been recognized was . Stock-based awards include (i) time-based RSUs, (ii) performance-based RSUs based on the achievement of adjusted EBITDA targets (the Adjusted EBITDA RSUs ), (iii) performance-based RSUs based on the Company s total shareholder return relative to a group of peers over a performance period (the rTSR RSUs and (iv) employee stock purchase plan rights. The Company determines the fair value of time-based RSUs based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the award. The Company determines the original fair value of Adjusted EBITDA RSUs based upon the closing market price of the Company s stock on the date of the award and adjusts the fair value quarterly during the first year based upon actual and forecasted results against Adjusted EBITDA targets. The Company estimates the fair value of rTSR RSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. The Company estimates the fair value of employee stock purchase plan rights using the Black-Scholes valuation method. Such values are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis for time-based awards and rTSR RSUs and using the accelerated graded vesting method for Adjusted EBITDA RSUs, all over the requisite service periods.

Semiconductor Market 
 MKS is a critical solutions provider for semiconductor manufacturing. Our products are used in major semiconductor processing steps, such as deposition, etching, cleaning, lithography, metrology, and inspection. The semiconductor industry continually faces new challenges, as products become smaller, more powerful and highly mobile. Ultra-thin layers, smaller critical dimensions, new materials, 3D structures, and the ongoing need for higher yield and productivity drive the need for tighter process measurement and control, all of which MKS supports. We believe we are the broadest critical subsystem provider in the wafer fabrication equipment WFE ecosystem and address over 85 of the market. We characterize our broad and unique offering as Surround the Wafer to reflect the technology enablement we provide across almost every major process in semiconductor manufacturing today. 
 The semiconductor market is subject to rapid demand shifts, which are difficult to predict, and we cannot be certain as to the timing or extent of future demand or any future softening in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. In addition to these rapid demand shifts, the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to significant trade restrictions, especially in China. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues in our semiconductor market increased by 9 million, or 3 , compared to the prior quarter primarily due to strong in-quarter demand conversion within VSD. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues in our semiconductor market decreased by 19 million, or 2 , compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was mainly due to continued softened demand for semiconductor capital equipment related to deposition and etching, partially offset by an increase in sales of our lithography, metrology and inspection products.

Electronics and Packaging Market 
 MKS is a foundational solutions provider for the electronics and packaging market. Our portfolio includes photonics components, laser drilling systems, electronics chemistries and plating equipment that are critical for the manufacturing of PCBs and package substrates, and critical to wafer level packaging WLP applications. Similar to the semiconductor industry, the PCB, package substrate and WLP industries demand smaller features, greater density, and better performance. In addition, the electronics and packaging market also includes sales of our vacuum and photonics solutions for display manufacturing applications. We characterize our complementary offering of laser systems and chemistry solutions as Optimize the Interconnect , to reflect the unique technology enablement we provide at the Interconnect level within PCBs, package substrates and WLPs. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues in our electronics and packaging market increased by 2 million, or 1 , compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in chemistry sales within MSD. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues in our electronics and packaging market decreased by 22 million, or 3 , compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower revenue within MSD mainly as a result of lower palladium prices that are passed through to our customers, which were partially offset by volume growth in chemistry sales. 
 Specialty Industrial Market 
 MKS strategy in the specialty industrial market is to leverage our domain expertise and proprietary technologies across a broad array of applications in industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense markets. 
 Industrial Technologies 
 Industrial technologies encompasses a wide range of diverse applications, including chemistries for functional coatings, surface finishing and wear resistance in the automobile industry, vacuum solutions for synthetic diamond manufacturing and photonics for solar manufacturing. Other applications include vacuum and photonics solutions for light emitting diode and laser diode manufacturing. 
 Life and Health Sciences 
 Our products for life and health sciences are used in a diverse array of applications, including bioimaging, medical instrument sterilization, medical device manufacturing, analytical, diagnostic and surgical instrumentation, consumable medical supply manufacturing and pharmaceutical production. 
 Research and Defense 
 Our products for research and defense are sold to government, university and industrial laboratories for applications involving research and development in materials science, physical chemistry, photonics, optics and electronics materials. Our products are also sold for monitoring and defense applications, including surveillance, imaging and infrastructure protection. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues in our specialty industrial market decreased by 2 million, or 1 , compared to the prior quarter mainly due to lower revenue in our material processing and defense markets within PSD. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues in our specialty industrial market decreased by 37 million, or 4 , compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was mainly due to lower revenue in general industrial and solar markets within VSD. 
 International Markets 
 Starting in the second quarter of 2024, we changed our basis of reporting geographical net revenues from the location in which the sale originated to the shipped-to location of the end customer. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change, which was made to better align with how management reviews geographic net revenues. 
 A significant portion of our net revenues is from sales to customers in international markets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, international net revenues accounted for approximately 77 and 75 , respectively, of our total net revenues. A significant portion of our international net revenues was generated from sales to customers in China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore. We expect international net revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net revenues for the foreseeable future. 
 30 

Long-lived assets located outside of the United States accounted for approximately 61 and 58 of our total long-lived assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, net, right-of-use assets, net and certain other assets. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased 4 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase of 4 million in compensation-related costs, including salaries, fringe and variable compensation expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly due to decreases of 7 million in compensation-related costs, including salaries, fringe and variable compensation expenses, 3 million in test equipment and 1 million in project material costs. 
 Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments, components, chemistry, subsystems, systems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity. We have thousands of products, and our research and development efforts primarily consist of a large number of projects related to these products, none of which is individually material to us. Projects typically have a duration of three to thirty-six months but may be extended for development of new products. 
 We continue to make product advancements designed to meet our customers evolving needs. We have developed, and continue to develop, new products designed to address industry trends, such as the rising demand for more complex hardware architecture related to increasing investments in artificial intelligence, the shrinking of integrated circuit critical dimensions and technology inflections, and, in the flat panel display and solar markets, the transition to larger substrate sizes, which require more advanced processing and process control technology, the continuing drive toward more complex and accurate components and devices within the handset and tablet market, the transition to 5G for both devices and infrastructure, the growth in units and via counts in the high density interconnect PCB drilling market, and the transition from internal combustion to electric vehicles. In addition, we have developed, and continue to develop, products that support the migration to new classes of materials, ultra-thin layers, and 3D structures that are used in small geometry manufacturing. In our chemistry and equipment plating businesses, a majority of our research and development investment supports existing customers product improvement needs and their short-term research and development goals, which enables us to pioneer 
 33 

new high-value solutions while limiting commercial risk. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development, fees paid to consultants, material costs for prototypes and other expenses related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. 
 We believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets. We expect to continue to make significant investment in research and development activities. We are subject to risks from products not being developed in a timely manner, as well as from rapidly changing customer requirements and competitive threats from other companies and technologies. Our success primarily depends on our products being designed into new generations of equipment for the semiconductor, electronics and packaging, and specialty industrial markets. We seek to develop products that are technologically advanced so that they are positioned to be chosen for use in each successive generation of semiconductor capital equipment and advanced markets applications. If our products are not chosen to be designed into our customers products, our net revenues may be reduced during the lifespan of those products.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of softer industry demand, particularly in the personal computer and smartphone markets, we concluded there was a triggering event in the three months ended June 30, 2023 at our electronics EL and general metal finishing GMF reporting units, which together constitute MSD, and the ESB reporting unit of PSD. 
 For the EL, GMF and ESB reporting units, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill using a combination of market approach and the income approach. Fair value estimates are based on a complex set of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by our management. There are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in these determinations. 
 This quantitative assessment resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment of 826 million for the EL reporting unit, 428 million for the GMF reporting unit and 372 million for the ESB reporting unit. In addition, we recorded a 49 million impairment of in-process research and development allocated to the EL reporting unit and a 152 million impairment related to completed technology allocated to the ESB reporting unit. 
 We will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. If market and economic conditions or business performance deteriorate, the likelihood that we would record an impairment charge would increase, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 We have concluded there were no triggering events across our reporting units through the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Our effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax benefit related to the earnings mix, an increase in the U.S. deduction for foreign derived intangibles income FDII and a one-time increase in research and development credits due to the filing of prior year amended returns for 2020 and 2021, partially offset by an expected increase in foreign withholding taxes and a waiver of deductions related to U.S. base erosion payments. 
 Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.2 and 4.1 , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax benefit related to the earnings mix, increase in the U.S. deduction for FDII and a one-time increase in research and development credits due to filing of prior year amended returns for years 2020 and 2021, partially offset by an expected increase in foreign withholding taxes and a waiver of deductions related to U.S. base erosion payments. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax benefit related to the impairment of intangible assets and various tax credits. 
 On a quarterly basis, we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that affects the realizability of net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance. The future benefit to be derived from our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in each jurisdiction of the right type to realize the assets . 
 Our future effective tax rate depends on various factors, including the impact of tax legislation, further interpretations and guidance from U.S. federal and state governments on the impact of proposed regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, further interpretations and guidance from foreign governments, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, 
 36 

and changes in income tax reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. We monitor these factors and timely adjust our estimates of the effective tax rate accordingly. We expect the Atotech Acquisition will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate as MSD operates primarily in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. However, the geographic mix of pre-tax income can change based on multiple factors, resulting in changes to the effective tax rate in future periods. While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could materially differ from our accrued positions as a result of uncertain and complex application of tax law and regulations. Additionally, the recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and requires judgment by management. Accordingly, we may record additional provisions or benefits for U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax matters in future periods as new information becomes available. 
 Many countries in which we operate have implemented or are implementing legislation and other tax changes to align their tax systems with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development global minimum tax rate known as Pillar Two of the Global Anti-Base Erosion GloBE rules. The GloBE rules provide a framework for a coordinated multi-country system of taxation intended to ensure large multinational enterprise groups pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each of the jurisdictions where they operate. Many jurisdictions, including many EU countries, have enacted certain provisions of the GloBE rules effective as of January 1, 2024. The Company does not expect the GloBE rules to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 861 million and 875 million, respectively. The primary driver in our current and anticipated future cash flows is, and we expect will continue to be, cash generated from operations, consisting primarily of our net income (loss), excluding non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities. In periods when our sales are growing, higher sales to customers will result in increased trade receivables, and inventories will generally increase as we build products for future sales. This may result in lower cash generated from operations. Conversely, in periods when our sales are declining, our accounts receivable and inventory balances will generally decrease, resulting in increased cash from operations. We believe that our current cash and investments position and available borrowing capacity, together with the cash anticipated to be generated from our future operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated working capital, planned capital expenditure requirements, payments of debt, and any future cash dividends declared by our Board of Directors or share repurchases through at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 352 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from net income of 99 million, which included non-cash charges of 254 million, mainly the result of 262 million of depreciation and amortization expense and 52 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by 168 million in deferred income taxes and a net increase in working capital of 1 million. The net increase in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation of 26 million, a decrease in accounts payable of 21 million and a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities of 28 million. This net increase in working capital was partially offset by increases in income taxes payable of 53 million, other current and non-current assets of 17 million and inventory of 11 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 66 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of 67 million in capital expenditures. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 303 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of Convertible Notes of 1.4 billion and incremental loans under the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 761 million. The proceeds of the incremental loans under the Term Loan Facility were used in part to prepay the USD Tranche A term loans outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined and described further below under Credit Facilities in full in an aggregate principal amount of 744 million and the proceeds of the Convertible Notes were used in part to prepay a portion of the USD Tranche B loans in an aggregate principal amount of 1.2 billion. In addition, there were normal quarterly debt payments and voluntary prepayments that totaled 248 million. We also made payments of 167 million to purchase a capped call option related to the Convertible Notes, 33 million for debt financing costs and 44 million for dividends. 
 Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when they are declared by our Board of Directors. During each of the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.22 per share. The cash dividends totaled 44 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. On November 4, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.22 per share to be paid on December 6, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 25, 2024. Future dividend declarations, if any, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.

Credit Facilities 
 In connection with the completion of the Atotech Acquisition, on August 17, 2022 (the Effective Date we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, Barclays Bank PLC, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, which we have amended several times since (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement ). As of September 30, 2024, the Amended Credit Agreement provided for (i) a senior secured term loan facility comprised of two tranches: a 2.6 billion loan (the USD Tranche B and a 800 million loan (the Euro Tranche B and together with the USD Tranche B, the Term Loan Facility and (ii) a senior secured revolving credit facility of 675 million (the Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities ), with the commitments under each of the foregoing facilities subject to increase from time to time subject to certain conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facilities bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, any of the following, plus, in each case, an applicable margin: (a) with respect to the USD Tranche B and the Revolving Facility, (x) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50 , (2) the prime rate quoted in The Wall Street Journal, or (3) a forward-looking term rate based on the variable secured overnight financing rate Term SOFR (plus an applicable credit spread adjustment) for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00 , and (y) a Term SOFR rate (plus an applicable credit spread adjustment) for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, subject to a rate floor of (I) with respect to the USD Tranche B, 0.50 and (II) with respect to the Revolving Facility, 0.0 ; and (b) with respect to the Euro Tranche B, a Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for Euro deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a EURIBOR rate floor of 0.0 . As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margins for borrowings under the Credit Facilities were (i) under the USD Tranche B and the Revolving Facility, 1.25 with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.25 with respect to Term SOFR borrowings and (ii) under the Euro Tranche B, 2.75 . 
 In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Facilities, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments under the Revolving Facility. The commitment fee is subject to adjustment based on our first lien net leverage ratio as of the end of the preceding fiscal quarter. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. As of September 30, 2024, the commitment fee was 0.25 per annum representing a downward adjustment from 0.375 as of June 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate of the Term Loan Facility was 6.9 . The Revolving Facility has a maturity date in August 2027 while the USD Tranche B and Euro Tranche B have a maturity date in August 2029. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Facility. 
 We are required to make scheduled quarterly principal payments equal to approximately 10 million with respect to the USD Tranche B and approximately 2 million with respect to the Euro Tranche B, in each case with the balance due thereunder on the seventh anniversary of the Effective Date. There is no scheduled amortization under the Revolving Facility. Any principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Facility is due and payable in full on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date. 
 Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we are required to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of our annual excess cash flow as well as with the net cash proceeds of certain of its asset sales, certain casualty and condemnation events and the incurrence or issuances of certain debt. If at any time the aggregate amount of outstanding loans, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit under the Revolving Facility exceeds the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Facility, we are required to repay outstanding loans and/or cash collateralize letters of credit, with no reduction of the commitment amount. 
 We may voluntarily prepay, and have voluntarily repaid, outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities from time to time, subject to certain conditions, without premium or penalty other than customary breakage costs with respect to Term SOFR or EURIBOR loans and any prepayment premium that might be applicable to repayments we make prior to January 23, 2025. Additionally, we may voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the commitment amount under the Revolving Facility. 
 On October 23, 2024, we made a voluntary prepayment of 200 million principal amount, which equates to 216 million, to our Euro Tranche B loan under the Term Loan Facility. 
 All obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and are required to be guaranteed by certain of our future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. 
 Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the ability to incur additional incremental debt facilities in an amount up to (x) the greater of (1) 1,011 million and (2) 75 of consolidated last twelve months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, plus (y) an amount equal to the sum of all voluntary prepayments of term loans under the Term Loan Facility, plus (z) an additional unlimited amount subject to pro forma compliance with certain leverage ratio tests (based on the security and priority of such incremental debt). 
 38 

The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and provisions relating to events of default. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. The USD Tranche B and the Euro Tranche B are not subject to financial maintenance covenants. 
 On May 16, 2024, we completed a private offering of Convertible Notes. A significant portion of the net proceeds from the offering was used to repay approximately 1.2 billion of the USD Tranche B. As a result of the repayment, we recorded a 38 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 Convertible Notes 
 On May 16, 2024, we completed a private offering of 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2030 (the Convertible Notes ). The Convertible Notes were sold in a private placement under a purchase agreement, dated as of May 13, 2024, entered into by and among us and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc. and Mizuho Securities USA LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers named therein, for resale to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 The net proceeds from the offering were approximately 1.4 billion after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses paid by us. We used approximately 167 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below. We used the remaining net proceeds from the offering to repay approximately 1.2 billion in borrowings outstanding under the USD Tranche B, together with accrued interest, as well as for general corporate purposes. 
 Indenture and the Convertible Notes 
 On May 16, 2024, we entered into an indenture (the Indenture with respect to the Convertible Notes with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. Under the Indenture, the Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ours and bear interest at a coupon rate of 1.25 per annum, with interest payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024. The Convertible Notes will mature on June 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. 
 Subject to certain conditions, on or after June 5, 2027, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date the notice of redemption is sent. 
 The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is initially 6.4799 shares of our common stock per one thousand dollars principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 154.32 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. 
 Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. Prior to March 1, 2030, noteholders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 
 If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default that are occurring and continuing, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare 100 of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Convertible Notes to be due and payable. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Convertible Notes are classified as a long-term liability, net of issuances costs, on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Convertible Notes were issued at par and costs associated with the issuance of the Convertible Notes are amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate of the Convertible Notes was 1.56 . 
 39 

Capped Call Transactions 
 On May 13, 2024, in connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, and on May 14, 2024, in connection with the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes or their respective affiliates and other financial institutions. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of any Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments that we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap initially equal to 237.42 per share (which represents a premium of 100 over the last reported sale price of 118.71 per share of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 13, 2024), and is subject to customary adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. 
 Lines of Credit and Borrowing Arrangements 
 Certain of our Japanese subsidiaries have lines of credit and a financing facility with various financial institutions, many of which generally expire and are renewed at three-month intervals with the remaining having no expiration date. These lines of credit and financing facility provided for aggregate borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of up to an equivalent of 21 million and 14 million, respectively. There were no borrowings under these arrangements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Derivatives 
 We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally, and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts and options, to manage certain foreign currency exposure, and interest rate swaps and caps to manage interest rate exposure. 
 By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and no collateral is required. We have policies to monitor the credit risk of these counterparties. While there can be no assurance, we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties. 
 Interest Rate Agreements 
 We have various interest rate swap agreements as described further in Note 5 to the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. These interest rate swap agreements exchange the variable Term SOFR rate to a fixed rate in order to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with the variable Term SOFR rate paid on the outstanding balance of the Term Loan Facility. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ), which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We do not expect the additional disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 40 

Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which focuses on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 requires a public business entity PBE to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5 of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 
 Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires public companies to disclose, in interim and annual reporting periods, additional information about certain expenses in the notes to financial statements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Information concerning market risk is contained in the section entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contained in our Annual Report. As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our exposure to market risk from December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 4.	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (who served as both our principal executive officer and principal financial officer for the three months ended September 30, 2024), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Benefits payable under this Section 6(e)(ii) will terminate to the extent Employee ceases to be eligible for COBRA coverage under the Company s medical benefits plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not pay the contribution toward COBRA coverage described above to the extent that the Company reasonably determines that doing so would subject the Company to the excise tax under Section 4980D of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code (as a result of discriminatory coverage under a group health plan). 

(f) Eligibility for Enhanced Severance Compensation.

The Company s good-faith determination that one or more of the conditions listed above has not been satisfied will be binding and conclusive. 

(g) Enhanced Severance Compensation. If Employee becomes eligible for the Enhanced Severance Compensation: 

(i)	 Base Salary. The Company will pay Employee, within 14 days after the General Release Agreement becomes irrevocable, a lump sum in an 

amount equal to one and one-half times annual Base Salary (determined without regard to any reduction in Base Salary giving rise to Good Reason, as defined below). 
 (ii)	 Incentive Compensation. The Company will pay Employee, within 14 days after the General Release Agreement becomes irrevocable, a lump sum equal to one and one-half times the annual amount of incentive compensation for which Employee was eligible under any Incentive Compensation Plan of the Company then in effect for the year containing the Employment End Date. Additionally, Employee will receive a payment for target bonus, prorated for the current year. 
 (iii)	 Continuation of Benefits. For a period of 18 months after the Employment End Date, to the extent Employee is eligible for and elects to continue group medical, vision, or dental insurance coverage under COBRA and timely remits the amount of premium assessed to similarly situated active employees for comparable coverage, the Company will pay the Company s usual share of such premiums. Benefits payable under this Section 6(g)(iii) will terminate to the extent Employee ceases to be eligible for COBRA coverage under the Company s medical benefits plan.

Employee's unvested equity awards as of the Employment End Date will be subject to accelerated vesting to the extent provided in the respective equity award agreement issued to Employee under the then effective MKS Instruments, Inc. equity incentive plan (including the MKS Instruments, Inc. 2022 Stock Incentive Plan). 
 (h) No Obligation to Mitigate Damages; Effect on Other Contractual Rights. Employee will not be required to mitigate damages, by seeking other employment or otherwise, as a condition of receiving any portion of the Ordinary Severance Compensation or the Enhanced Severance Compensation. Nor will the Ordinary Severance Compensation or the Enhanced Severance Compensation be reduced by any compensation earned by Employee as the result of employment by an employer other than the Company or a direct or indirect parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company after the Employment End Date. Nothing in this Section 6(h) is intended to or shall delay, prevent or require any compensation for any termination of COBRA benefits that may occur pursuant to Section 6(e)(ii) or Section 6(g)(iii) above. 

(i) Cause. Cause to terminate Employee s employment will exist if Employee: 

(i)	commits a felony or engages in fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement; 

(ii)	knowingly fails or refuses to perform Employee s duties in a material way and, to the extent that the Company determines such failure or refusal can reasonably be cured, fails or refuses to effect a cure within 10 days after the Company notifies Employee in writing of the failure or refusal; 
 (iii)	knowingly causes, or knowingly creates a serious risk of causing, material harm to the Company s business or reputation; or 
 (iv)	breaches, in a material way, this Employment Agreement, the Confidential Information Agreement or any other agreement between Employee and the Company, and, to the extent that the Company determines such breach can reasonably be cured, fails or refuses to effect a cure within 10 days after the Company notifies Employee in writing of the breach.

(b) MKS Employment means the period beginning on the first day that Employee is employed by the Company and ending on the first day on which Employee is no longer employed by any MKS Entity (as defined below). 

(c) MKS Entity means (i) the Company; (ii) any current or future parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; or (iii) any successor or assign of (i) or (ii).

(e) The post-employment Non-Compete Period shall be extended to two (2) years upon Employee s breach of his/her fiduciary duty and/or unlawful taking, physically or electronically, of property belonging to the Company. 

(f) If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that this Section 7 is unenforceable because the Non-Compete Period is too long or because Competitive Activity includes too great a range of activities or too wide a geographic scope, the parties agree that this Section 7 should be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time or range of activities or geographic scope as to which it may be enforceable. 

(g) The post-employment restrictions on Employee s conduct contained in this Employment Agreement and in the Confidential Information Agreement will continue to apply even if Employee s duties, title, compensation, location or other terms or conditions of employment change, and even if such change or changes are material. 

(h) The Company and Employee agree that violation by Employee of any of the provisions of this Section 7 of this Employment Agreement would cause the Company irreparable harm beyond what could reasonably or adequately be compensated in damages, and that the Company would therefore be entitled (in addition to the Company s other remedies) to an injunction, declaratory judgment or restraining order against any such violation or threatened violation.

Any payments contingent upon the General Release Agreement that would otherwise be made during the period for review and revocation of the General Release Agreement will be made, provided that the General Release Agreement is timely executed and returned to the Company and not revoked, on the first scheduled payment date after such period ends. Each payment in respect of Employee s termination of employment under Section 6 of the Employment Agreement is designated as a separate payment for Section 409A purposes.

amount would avoid the Parachute Tax entirely and (c) payment of such lesser amount would, after taking into account applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Parachute Tax, result in Employee receiving a greater after-tax payment than if the Company made the Payments in full, then the Company will pay Employee such lesser amount instead of making the Payments in full. The reporting and payment of any Parachute Tax will in all events be Employee s responsibility. The Company will not in any event provide a gross-up or any other payment to compensate Employee for the payment of the Parachute Tax or for any reduction in the Payments. The Company will withhold from the Payments any amounts it reasonably determines are required under Code Section 4999(c) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

13. Entire Agreement and Severability . This Employment Agreement and the Confidential Information Agreement supersede any and all other agreements, either oral or in writing, between Employee and the Company with respect to the Company s employment of Employee and contain all of the covenants and agreements between the parties with respect to such employment. Neither party is entering into this Employment Agreement on the basis of any representation, inducement, promise or agreement, oral or otherwise, by any party, or by any one acting on behalf of any party, which is not stated herein. Any modification of this Employment Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and signed by both parties to this Employment Agreement. If any provision in this Employment Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will nevertheless continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated in any way. 

14. Miscellaneous . This Employment Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding (but only to the extent permitted by law) its conflict of laws and choice of law rules. The parties agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. certified mail or overnight delivery by a generally recognized commercial courier service to Employee s last known address (or any mode 

of service recognized to be effective by applicable law) will be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against Employee.

(c) The arbitration will be held in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It will be conducted in accordance with the then-prevailing Employment Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Employment Agreement or any other agreement or of any arbitration rules, no Legal Dispute involving any MKS Entity may be included in any class or collective arbitration or any other class or collective proceeding. The exclusive method for resolving any such Legal Dispute will be arbitration on an individual basis. 

(e) Any issues about whether a dispute is subject to arbitration will be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. Any issues about the meaning or enforceability of Section 15(d) will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. 

(f) The Company, Employee and the arbitrator will treat all aspects of the arbitration proceedings, including without limitation, discovery, testimony and other evidence, briefs and the award, as strictly confidential, except that the arbitration award may be disclosed to the extent necessary to enforce the award, the provisions of the Confidential Information Agreement, or the provisions of this Employment Agreement. 

(g) Employee and the Company understand and acknowledge that by agreeing to arbitrate the disputes covered by this Section 15, they are waiving the right to resolve those disputes in court and waiving any right to a jury trial with respect to those disputes.
