 Executive Summary 
 Our financial results in the third quarter of 2024 reflected continued improvement in our net interest margin NIM ), low net charge-offs, growth in customer deposits and loans, a record quarter for capital markets fee income, and deterioration in certain credit quality metrics. Diluted earnings per share EPS was 1.37, compared with 1.13 in the third quarter of 2023, as higher net interest income and a lower provision for credit losses were partially offset by lower noninterest income. 
 Net interest income increased 35 million, or 6 , relative to the prior year period, as higher earning asset yields were partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest income was also impacted by growth in average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was 3.03 , compared with 2.93 . 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 2.2 billion, or 3 , as growth in average money market investments and average loans and leases, was partially offset by a decline in average securities. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 4.3 billion, or 8 , driven by increases in average interest-bearing deposits and average borrowed funds. 
 Total loans and leases increased 2.0 billion, or 3 , primarily due to growth in the consumer 1-4 family residential mortgage and commercial and industrial loan portfolios. 
 Total deposits increased 319 million, as an increase in interest-bearing deposits was partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Customer deposits (excluding brokered deposits) increased 1.7 billion, or 2 , to 70.5 billion, compared with 68.8 billion. 
 The provision for credit losses was 13 million, compared with 41 million in the prior year period. 
 Customer-related noninterest income increased 4 million, or 3 , driven largely by increases in capital markets fees and commercial account fees, partially offset by a decline in loan-related fees and income. Decreases in noncustomer-related noninterest income were primarily due to credit valuation adjustments on client-related interest rate swaps, and a decline in dividends on Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB stock. 
 Noninterest expense increased 6 million, or 1 . Salaries and employee benefits expense increased primarily due to a decline in capitalized salaries related to reduced software development activities, and technology, telecom, and information processing expense increased primarily due to higher application software, license, and maintenance expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other expenses, including professional and legal services and occupancy and equipment expenses. 
 Net loan and lease charge-offs totaled 3 million, or 0.02 , of average loans and leases, compared with 14 million, or 0.10 , in the prior year quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses ACL to total loans and leases was 1.25 , compared with 1.30 . 
 Nonperforming assets totaled 368 million, or 0.62 , of total loans and leases and other real estate owned, compared with 219 million, or 0.38 . The increase was primarily due to a small number of loans in the commercial and industrial and term commercial real estate CRE portfolios. 
 Classified loans totaled 2.1 billion, or 3.55 , of total loans and leases, compared with 769 million, or 1.35 . The increase was primarily in the multifamily CRE loan portfolio, largely due to a change in approach to risk grading that places more emphasis on current cash flow, which is the primary source of repayment, and less emphasis on the adequacy of collateral values and the strength of guarantors and sponsors. The increase in classified loans was also attributable to weaker performance, particularly for 2021 and 2022 construction loan vintages, as borrowers missed projections due to lower-than-anticipated leasing, rent concessions, elevated costs, and higher interest rates. 
 Total borrowed funds, consisting primarily of secured borrowings, decreased 1.4 billion, or 29 , from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a decrease in security repurchase agreements.

 Net interest income accounted for approximately 78 and 76 of our net revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and increased 35 million, or 6 , relative to the prior year quarter, as the repricing of interest-earning assets outpaced the increase in funding costs. Net interest income was also impacted by growth in average interest-earning assets. The NIM was 3.03 , compared with 2.93 . 
 The yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.35 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 33 basis points bps ), reflecting higher interest rates and a favorable mix change to higher yielding assets, as average securities decreased, and average loans and average money market investments increased. The yield on average loans and leases increased 31 bps to 6.15 , and the yield on average securities increased 13 bps to 2.86 in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was 2.36 , compared with 2.10 in the prior year quarter, and the cost of total deposits was 2.14 , compared with 1.92 , reflecting the higher interest rate environment and reduced noninterest-bearing deposits. 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 2.2 billion, or 3 from the prior year quarter, as growth of 2.3 billion in average money market investments and 1.7 billion in average loans and leases, was partially offset by a decline of 1.8 billion in average securities. The decrease in average securities was primarily due to principal reductions. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 4.3 billion, or 8 , from the prior year quarter, driven by increases of 2.5 billion in average interest-bearing deposits, primarily due to customer deposit growth, and 1.8 billion in average borrowed funds, primarily due to increased short-term borrowings. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 52 million, or 3 , relative to the same prior year period, as higher funding costs more than offset higher earning asset yields.

 The following charts further illustrate the changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities: 
 
 Average loans and leases increased 1.7 billion, or 3 , to 58.7 billion, primarily due to growth in average consumer and commercial real estate loans. Average securities decreased 1.8 billion, or 9 , to 19.4 billion, primarily due to principal reductions. 
 
 Average deposits decreased 0.7 billion, or 1 , to 75.0 billion at an average cost of 2.14 , from 75.7 billion at an average cost of 1.92 in the third quarter of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 3.2 billion, or 11 , relative to the prior year quarter, and were relatively flat compared with the ending balance at June 30, 2024, reflecting stabilization during the current quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 33 of total deposits, compared with 37 during the same prior year period.

 Average borrowed funds, consisting primarily of secured borrowings, increased 1.8 billion, or 39 , to 6.3 billion, primarily due to increased short-term borrowings, including advances under the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ).

 The Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses ACL is the combination of both the allowance for loan and lease losses ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments RULC ). The ALLL represents the estimated current expected credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The RULC represents the estimated reserve for current expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments. Changes in the ALLL and RULC, net of charge-offs and recoveries, are recorded as the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments, respectively, on the consolidated statement of income. The ACL for debt securities is estimated separately from loans and is included in Investment securities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 The ACL was 736 million at September 30, 2024, and was relatively flat compared with 738 million at September 30, 2023. The slight decrease in the ACL primarily reflects improvements in economic forecasts and declines in unfunded lending commitments related to construction lending, partially offset by increases associated with declines in credit quality, incremental reserves associated with portfolio-specific risks including CRE, average loan growth of 1.7 billion, and changes in our loan portfolio composition. The ratio of ACL to total loans and leases was 1.25 at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.30 at September 30, 2023. 
 The provision for credit losses, which is the combination of both the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments, was 13 million, compared with 41 million in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for securities losses was less than 1 million during both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023.

 ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The bar chart above illustrates the broad categories of change in the ACL from the prior year period. To estimate current expected losses, we use econometric loss models that include multiple economic scenarios that reflect optimistic, baseline, and stressed economic conditions. The results derived using these economic scenarios are weighted to produce the credit loss estimate. Management may adjust the weights to reflect their assessment of current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The second bar represents changes in these economic forecasts and current economic conditions, including management's judgment of the weighting of the economic forecasts during the current quarter. These changes contributed to a 199 million decrease in the ACL from the prior year quarter. 
 The third bar represents changes in credit quality factors and includes risk grade migration, portfolio-specific risks, and specific reserves against loans, which, when combined, contributed to a 163 million increase in the ACL, driven largely by declines in credit quality and an increased focus on certain portfolio-specific risks, including commercial real estate. 
 The fourth bar represents changes in our loan portfolio composition, including changes in loan balances and mix, the aging of the portfolio, and other qualitative risk factors; all of which contributed to a 34 million increase in the ACL. 
 See Credit Risk Management on page 21 and Note 6 in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on how we determine the appropriate level of the ALLL and the RULC.

 Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income represents revenue earned from products and services that generally have no associated interest rate or yield and is classified as either customer-related or noncustomer-related. Customer-related noninterest income excludes items such as securities gains and losses, dividends, insurance-related income, and mark-to-market adjustments on certain derivatives. 
 Noninterest income accounted for approximately 22 and 24 of our net revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and decreased 8 million, or 4 , relative to the prior year quarter. The following schedule presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income:

 Customer-related Noninterest Income 
 Customer-related noninterest income increased 4 million, or 3 , compared with the prior year period. Capital markets fees increased 10 million, largely due to increased swap fees, loan syndication fees, and expanded real estate capital markets activity, and commercial account fees increased 3 million. These increases were partially offset by a 6 million decrease in loan-related fees and income, primarily due to higher gains on loan sales in the prior year period and a decline in loan servicing income resulting from the sale of associated mortgage servicing rights in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Noncustomer-related Noninterest Income 
 Noncustomer-related noninterest income decreased 12 million from the prior year quarter. Fair value and nonhedge derivative income decreased 10 million, primarily due to credit valuation adjustments on client-related interest rate swaps, and dividends and other income decreased 7 million, primarily due to a decline in dividends on FHLB stock. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 5 million in net securities gains, largely due to valuation adjustments in our Small Business Investment Company SBIC investment portfolio.

 Noninterest Expense 
 The following schedule presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense:

 499 493 6 1 1,516 1,496 20 1 
 Total noninterest expense increased 6 million, or 1 , relative to the prior year quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 6 million, or 2 , primarily due to a decline in capitalized salaries related to reduced software development activities, as well as higher benefits accruals, and an additional business day during the current quarter. Technology, telecom, and information processing expense increased 4 million, or 6 , primarily due to increases in application software, license, and maintenance expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other expenses including professional and legal services associated with reduced technology-related consulting services and occupancy and equipment expenses. 
 Adjusted noninterest expense increased 6 million, or 1 . The efficiency ratio was 62.5 , compared with 64.4 , due to an increase in adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see page 38. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense increased 21 million, or 1 , relative to the same prior year period. Technology, telecom, and information processing expense increased 19 million, or 11 , primarily due to increases in software amortization expenses associated with the replacement of substantially all of our in-scope core loan and deposit banking systems. Deposit insurance and regulatory expense increased 14 million, or 23 , driven largely by a 13 million accrual associated with an updated special assessment estimate by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC during the first quarter of 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 8 million, or 1 , in salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily due to higher severance expense and incentive compensation accruals in the prior year period. 
 
 Technology Spend 
 Consistent with our strategic objectives, we invest in technologies that will make us more efficient and enable us to remain competitive. We generally consider these investments as technology spend, which represents expenditures associated with technology-related investments, operations, systems, and infrastructure, and includes current period expenses presented on the consolidated statement of income, as well as capitalized investments, net of related amortization and depreciation, presented on the consolidated balance sheet. Technology spend is reported as a combination of the following: 
 Technology, telecom, and information processing expense includes expenses related to application software, licensing, and maintenance; related amortization; telecommunications; and data processing;

 Other technology-related expense includes related noncapitalized salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, and professional and legal services; and 
 Technology investments includes capitalized technology infrastructure equipment, hardware, and purchased or internally developed software, less related amortization or depreciation. 
 The following schedule presents the composition of our technology spend:

 116 122 (6) (5) 349 364 (15) (4) 
 Total technology spend decreased 6 million, or 5 , relative to the prior year quarter, as the aforementioned increase in technology, telecom, and information processing expense and an increase in other technology-related expense was more than offset by a decrease in certain technology investments, as the final phase of our multi-year project to replace substantially all of our in-scope core loan and deposit banking systems was completed in July 2024. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The following schedule summarizes the income tax expense and effective tax rates for the periods presented: 
 INCOME TAXES

 The effective tax rate was 22.7 and 23.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the factors that impacted the income tax rates, as well as information about deferred income tax assets and liabilities. 
 Preferred Stock Dividends 
 Preferred stock dividends totaled 10 million and 7 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to changes in the timing and rates of dividend payments for certain series of preferred stock. 
 
 BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
 Interest-Earning Assets 
 Interest-earning assets have associated interest rates or yields, and generally consist of loans and leases, securities, and money market investments. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets. For more information regarding the average balances, associated revenue generated, and the respective yields of our interest-earning assets, see the Consolidated Average Balance Sheet on page 10.

 Investment Securities Portfolio 
 We invest in securities to actively manage liquidity and interest rate risk and to generate interest income. We primarily own securities that can readily provide us cash and liquidity through secured borrowing agreements without the need to sell the securities. Our fixed-rate securities portfolio helps balance the inherent interest rate mismatch between loans and deposits and protects the economic value of shareholders equity. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated duration of our investment securities portfolio, which measures price sensitivity to interest rate changes, was 3.6 percent. 
 For information about our borrowing capacity associated with our investment securities portfolio and how we manage our liquidity risk, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management section on page 34. See also Note 3 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on fair value measurements and the accounting for our investment securities portfolio. 
 The following schedule presents the major components of our investment securities portfolio:

 The amortized cost of total investment securities decreased 1.6 billion, or 7 , from December 31, 2023, largely due to principal reductions. Approximately 7 of the total investment securities were floating-rate instruments at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had 3.6 billion of pay-fixed swaps designated as fair value hedges against fixed-rate available-for-sale AFS securities that effectively convert the fixed interest income to a floating rate on the hedged portion of the securities. 
 At September 30, 2024, our AFS investment securities portfolio included 181 million of net premium that was distributed across the various security categories. Total taxable-equivalent premium amortization for our total investment securities portfolio was 17 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 20 million for the same prior year period.

 Municipal Investments and Extensions of Credit 
 We support our communities by providing products and services to state and local governments municipalities ), including deposit services, loans, and investment banking services. We also invest in securities issued by municipalities. Our municipal lending products generally include loans in which the debt service is repaid from general funds or pledged revenues of the municipal entity, or to private commercial entities or 501(c)(3) not-for-profit entities utilizing a pass-through municipal entity to achieve favorable tax treatment. 
 The following schedule summarizes our total investments and extensions of credit to municipalities:

 6,289 6,253 
 Our municipal loans and securities are primarily associated with municipalities located within our geographic footprint. The municipal loan and lease portfolio is primarily secured by general obligations of municipal entities, real estate, revenue pledges, or equipment. At September 30, 2024, we had a small number of municipal loans on nonaccrual totaling 11 million; we had no municipal loans on nonaccrual at December 31, 2023. These loans were to private commercial entities utilizing a pass-through municipal entity to achieve favorable tax treatment. 
 Municipal securities are internally graded, similar to loans, using risk-grading systems which vary based on the size and type of credit risk exposure. The internal risk grades assigned to our municipal securities follow our definitions of Pass, Special Mention, and Substandard, which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications. At September 30, 2024, all municipal securities were graded as Pass. See Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans and securities. 
 Loan and Lease Portfolio 
 We provide a wide range of lending products to commercial customers, generally small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as other products secured by commercial real estate. We also provide various retail banking products and services to consumers and small businesses. The following schedule presents the composition of our loan and lease portfolio:

Loan growth was primarily in the consumer 1-4 family residential mortgage portfolio. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ratio of loans and leases to total assets was 68 and 66 , respectively. The largest loan category was commercial and industrial loans, which constituted 29 of our total loan portfolio for both time periods.

 Other noninterest-bearing investments decreased 4 million during the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to a decrease in FHLB stock, partially offset by higher valuation adjustments in our SBIC investment portfolio. We are required to invest approximately 4 of our FHLB borrowings in FHLB stock to maintain our borrowing capacity. The decrease in period-end FHLB activity stock was due to a decline in short-term FHLB borrowings.

At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, customer deposits (excluding brokered deposits) totaled 70.5 billion, and included approximately 7.3 billion and 6.8 billion, respectively, of reciprocal deposits. 
 At September 30, 2024, the estimated total amount of uninsured deposits was 33.1 billion, or 44 , of total deposits, compared with 33.2 billion, or 44 , at December 31, 2023. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 78 , compared with 77 for the same respective time periods. See Liquidity Risk Management on page 34 for additional information on liquidity, including the ratio of available liquidity to uninsured deposits. 
 
 RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Risk management is an integral part of our operations and is a key determinant of our overall performance. We employ various strategies to prudently manage the risks to which our operations are exposed, including credit risk, market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, strategic and business risk, operational risk, technology risk,

Table of Contents 
 ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 cybersecurity risk, capital/financial reporting risk, legal/compliance risk (including regulatory risk), and reputational risk. These risks are overseen by various management committees, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee. For a more comprehensive discussion of these risks, see Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Credit Risk Management 
 Credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower, guarantor, or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a credit-related contract. Credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities, as well as from off-balance sheet credit instruments. Credit policies, credit risk management, and credit examination functions inform and support the oversight of credit risk. Our credit policies emphasize strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate potential losses. These formal credit policies and procedures provide us with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level. 
 Our business activity is conducted primarily within the geographic footprint of our banking affiliates. We strive to avoid the risk of undue concentrations of credit in any particular industry, collateral type, location, or with any individual customer or counterparty. For a more comprehensive discussion of our credit risk management, see Credit Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 U.S. Government Agency Guaranteed Loans 
 We participate in various guaranteed lending programs sponsored by U.S. government agencies, such as the Small Business Administration SBA ), Federal Housing Authority, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Export-Import Bank of the U.S., and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. At September 30, 2024, 548 million of related loans were guaranteed, primarily by the SBA. The following schedule presents the composition of U.S. government agency guaranteed loans:

 Our commercial loans span various industries and generally mature within a one-to-five-year period with applicable amortization based on the underlying collateral and guarantees. Commercial loans are typically structured as seasonal, term, working capital, or bridge loans in the form of revolving and non-revolving lines of credit, amortizing term loans, guidance facilities, and single-payment loans. These loans include covenants requiring borrowers to provide regular financial reporting to measure leverage, debt service coverage, and liquidity. At

 September 30, 2024, approximately 70 of our commercial lending portfolio was variable rate, and approximately 10 of these variable-rate loans were swapped with our customers to a fixed rate. 
 Underwriting of commercial loans is primarily based on analyses of management, financial performance, industry, sponsorship (if applicable), and transaction structure, with credit enhancements typically provided by collateral and guarantees from the owners or sponsors. Prospective cash flows are subjected to various downside scenario analyses, including revenue decline, margin compression, and interest rate movements.

 Term CRE loans generally mature within a three- to seven-year period and consist of full, partial, and non-recourse guarantee structures. Typical term CRE loan structures include annually tested operating covenants that require loan rebalancing based on minimum debt service coverage, debt yield, or loan-to-value LTV tests. Construction and land development loans generally mature in 18 to 36 months and contain full or partial recourse guarantee structures with one- to five-year extension options or roll-to-perm options that often result in term loans. At September 30, 2024, approximately 86 of our CRE loan portfolio was variable-rate, and approximately 21 of these variable-rate loans were swapped with our customers to a fixed rate. 
 Underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with significant consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor. We generally require that the owner s equity be included prior to any advances. Remargining requirements (required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral) are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor. 
 Real estate appraisals are performed in accordance with regulatory guidelines. In some cases, reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed. An appraisal is ordered and reviewed prior to loan closing, and a new appraisal or evaluation is generally ordered when market conditions indicate a potential decline in the value of the collateral, or when the loan is either modified, renewed, or deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness. CRE LTVs are calculated by dividing the outstanding loan balance by the estimated collateral value from the most current appraisal. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average LTV ratio for our term CRE portfolio was less than 60 .

 As previously discussed, our commercial real estate lending portfolio is diversified across geography and collateral type, with the largest concentration in multifamily. We provide additional analysis of our multifamily and office CRE portfolios below in view of increased investor interest in those collateral types in recent periods. 
 Multifamily CRE 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our multifamily CRE loan portfolio totaled 3.9 billion and 3.7 billion, representing 29 and 28 of the total CRE loan portfolio, respectively. Approximately 33 of the multifamily CRE loan portfolio is scheduled to mature in the next 12 months. We believe that most of these borrowers will be able to refinance at maturity through the Bank, or other lenders, as a result of the cash flows from the properties, acceptable LTVs, equity levels, and guarantor support.

 1-4 Family Residential Mortgages 
 We originate first-lien residential home mortgage loans considered to be of prime quality. At September 30, 2024, our 1-4 family residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled 9.5 billion, or 65 , of our total consumer loan portfolio, compared with 8.4 billion, or 61 , at December 31, 2023. Approximately 91 and 93 of our 1-4 family residential mortgage loan portfolio was variable-rate for the same respective time periods. We generally hold variable-rate loans in our portfolio and sell conforming fixed-rate loans to third parties, including Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards. 
 Home Equity Credit Lines 
 We also originate home equity credit lines HECLs ). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our HECL portfolio totaled 3.5 billion and 3.4 billion, respectively. Approximately 37 and 39 of our HECLs were secured by first liens for the same respective time periods. 
 At September 30, 2024, loans representing less than 1 of the outstanding balance in the HECL portfolio were estimated to have combined loan-to-value CLTV ratios above 100 . An estimated CLTV ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateral value. At origination, underwriting standards for the HECL portfolio generally include a maximum 80 CLTV with a Fair Isaac Corporation FICO credit score greater than 700. 
 Approximately 92 of our HECL portfolio is still in the draw period, and about 21 of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years. We believe the risk of loss and borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the effect of significant interest rate changes is low, given the rate shock analysis performed at origination. The ratio of HECL net charge-offs (recoveries) for the trailing twelve months to average balances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was (0.01) and 0.05 , respectively. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit quality of the HECL portfolio.

 Classified Loans 
 Classified loans are considered loans with well-defined weaknesses and are assigned using our internal risk grade definitions of substandard and doubtful, which are consistent with regulatory risk classifications. The following schedule presents our classified loans by loan segment: 
 CLASSIFIED LOANS 
 (Dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial 
 964 482 Commercial real estate 1,042 280 Consumer 87 63 Total classified loans 2,093 825 Ratio of classified loans to total loans and leases 3.55 1.43 
 Classified loans totaled 2.1 billion, or 3.55 , of total loans and leases, at September 30, 2024, compared with 825 million, or 1.43 , at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily in the multifamily CRE loan portfolio, largely due to a change in approach to risk grading that places more emphasis on current cash flow, which is the primary source of repayment, and less emphasis on the adequacy of collateral values and the strength of guarantors and sponsors. The increase in classified loans was also attributable to weaker performance, particularly for 2021 and 2022 construction loan vintages, as borrowers missed projections due to lower-than-anticipated leasing, rent concessions, elevated costs, and higher interest rates. Our CRE loan portfolio continues to benefit from strong underwriting, supported by high borrower equity and guarantor support. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL, which consists of the ALLL and the RULC, represents our estimate of current expected credit losses 
 related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments as of the balance sheet date. 
 We estimate current expected credit losses, which include considerations of historical credit loss experience, current conditions, and standard economic forecasts, all of which inform the quantitative portion of our ACL. We also consider qualitative and environmental factors that may indicate losses may differ from levels estimated by our quantitative models. The impact of these factors on our ACL may change from quarter to quarter. 
 During recent quarters, the qualitative portion of the ACL has increased primarily due to (1) economic uncertainty, which caused us to increase the weights on recessionary economic forecasts, and (2) portfolio-specific risks, which caused us to use stressed economic forecasts for certain portfolios, particularly CRE.

 Interest Rate and Market Risk Management 
 Interest rate and market risk is the risk of losses to current or future earnings and capital from changes in interest rates and other market conditions. Because we engage in transactions involving various financial products, we are exposed to interest rate and market risk. For a more comprehensive discussion of our interest rate and market risk management, see Interest Rate and Market Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We strive to position the Bank for interest rate changes and manage the balance sheet sensitivity to reduce the volatility of both net interest income and economic value of equity EVE ). With the recent higher interest rate environment, customer deposit behavior has deviated from the trends observed during the relatively low interest rate period over the prior 15 years. As a result, customers have been more inclined to (1) move deposits to nonbanking products, such as money market mutual funds, that offer higher interest rates, and (2) reduce their balances in noninterest-bearing accounts. Observed changes in deposit behavior have been incorporated into our deposit models used in managing interest rate risk, giving more weight to the recently observed behavior, and increased both the deposit beta for interest-bearing products and the percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits assumed to migrate to interest-bearing products. Changes to models are independently reviewed by our Model Risk Management function. 
 We generally have granular deposit funding, and much of this funding is in the form of demand deposits with no maturity, which contractually can be withdrawn at any time. Rather than using contractual maturities, our interest rate risk model uses dynamically modeled behavioral assumptions based on historical behavior and future projections. Because many deposits from household and business accounts have proven to be stable over time and less sensitive to rate changes, their duration is generally longer than the duration of our loan portfolio. As such, we have historically been asset-sensitive meaning that our assets are expected to reprice faster or more significantly than our liabilities. We regularly use interest rate swaps, investment in fixed-rate securities, and funding strategies to manage our interest rate risk. These strategies collectively have muted the expected sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. Asset sensitivity measures depend upon the assumptions we use for deposit runoff and repricing behavior. Our models are particularly sensitive to these assumptions about the rate of such behavior. 
 We also assume a correlation, referred to as a deposit beta, with respect to interest-bearing deposits, wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared with changes in average benchmark interest rates. Generally, certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation, while interest-bearing checking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation. 
 The following schedule presents deposit duration assumptions discussed previously: 
 DEPOSIT ASSUMPTIONS 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Product Effective duration (-200 bps) Effective duration (unchanged) Effective duration (+200 bps) Effective duration (-200 bps) Effective duration (unchanged) Effective duration (+200 bps) Demand deposits 4.4 3.1 2.8 4.0 3.5 3.2 Money market 3.2 1.5 1.4 3.0 1.5 1.4 Savings and interest-bearing checking 2.5 2.1 1.8 2.7 2.2 1.9 
 The effective duration of the deposits increases as market rates decline due to the inability to reprice as deposits approach their floor. 
 As noted previously, we utilize derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The following schedule presents derivatives that are designated in qualifying hedging relationships at September 30, 2024. Included are the average outstanding derivative notional amounts for each period presented and the weighted average fixed-rate paid or received for each category of cash flow and fair value hedge. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact of these hedging relationships on interest income and expense.

 1 Cash flow hedges of assets consist of receive-fixed swaps hedging pools of floating-rate loans. The longest dated cash flow hedge matures in February 2027. Amounts for 2027 have not been prorated to reflect this hedge maturing during the period. 
 2 Cash flow hedges of liabilities consist of a pay-fixed swap hedging rolling FHLB advances. This swap matures in May 2025. 
 3 Fair value asset hedges consist of pay-fixed swaps hedging fixed-rate AFS securities and fixed-rate commercial loans, as further discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Increasing notional amounts in 2025 are due to forward starting swaps. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 117 million of net losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI related to terminated cash flow hedges. Amounts deferred in AOCI from terminated cash flow hedges will be amortized into interest income on a straight-line basis through the original maturity dates of the hedges as long as the hedged forecasted transactions continue to be expected to occur. For more information on amounts deferred in AOCI related to terminated cash flow hedges, see Interest Rate and Market Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Earnings at Risk (EaR) and Economic Value of Equity (EVE) 
 Incorporating our deposit assumptions and the impact of derivatives in qualifying hedging relationships previously discussed, the following schedule presents earnings at risk EaR ), or the percentage change in 12-month forward-looking net interest income, and our estimated percentage change in EVE. Both EaR and EVE are based on a static balance sheet size under instantaneous parallel interest rate changes ranging from -200 bps to +200 bps. These measures highlight the sensitivity to changes in interest rates across various scenarios; the outcomes are not intended to be forecasts of expected net interest income.

 The asset sensitivity, as measured by EaR, increased during the first nine months of 2024, due to securities redemptions, swap maturities, and assumption changes that reduced the projected runoff of noninterest-bearing deposits. Under our current deposit assumptions, interest rate risk remains within policy limits. For interest-bearing deposits with indeterminable maturities, the weighted average modeled beta is 55 . 
 Prepayment assumptions are an important factor in how we manage interest rate risk. Certain assets in our portfolio, such as 1-4 family residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, can be prepaid at any time by the borrower, which may significantly affect our expected cash flows. At September 30, 2024, lifetime prepayment speeds were estimated to be 15.8 for loans, which reflects an acceleration of prepayments upon rate reset for adjustable rate loans, and 7.1 for mortgage-backed securities. 
 The EaR analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of benchmark interest rates. In a non-parallel rate scenario, where short-term rates decline 200 bps, but long-term rates are unchanged, the EaR is comparable to the parallel rate scenario of similar rate shock. 
 If interest rates were to follow the rate path implied by the forward curve at September 30, 2024, modeled net interest income would increase in the third quarter of 2025 by an additional 1.4 , when compared to the third quarter of 2024. For a -100 bps and +100 bps parallel interest rate shock to the implied forward rate path, the cumulative net interest income sensitivity would be between (0.8) and 3.1 , respectively. 
 Our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of our asset-liability management posture. At September 30, 2024, 27.4 billion of our commercial and CRE loans were scheduled to reprice in the next six months. For these variable-rate loans, we have executed 350 million of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2024, we also had 4.0 billion of variable-rate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months. The impact on asset sensitivity from commercial or consumer loans with floors has become insignificant as rates have risen. See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments. 
 Fixed Income 
 We are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value. This includes market risk for trading securities and for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk. We underwrite municipal and corporate securities. We also trade municipal, agency, and treasury securities. This underwriting and trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed-income securities. 
 Changes in the fair value of AFS securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in AOCI for each financial reporting period. For more discussion regarding investment securities and AOCI, see the Capital Management section on page 35. See also Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the accounting for investment securities. 
 Equity Investments 
 Through our equity investment activities, we own equity securities that are publicly traded. In addition, we own equity securities in governmental entities and companies, e.g., Federal Reserve FRB and the FHLB, that are not publicly traded. For more information regarding our equity investments, see Interest Rate and Market Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly pre-public companies, primarily through various SBIC venture capital funds as a strategy to provide beneficial financing, growth, and expansion opportunities to diverse businesses generally in communities within our geographic footprint. Our equity exposure to these investments was approximately 202 million and 190 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On occasion, some of the companies within our SBIC investment may issue an initial public offering IPO ). In this case, the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before we can liquidate the investment, which can introduce additional market risk. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the valuation of our SBIC investments.

 Liquidity Risk Management 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to meet our cash, contractual, and collateral obligations, and to manage both expected and unexpected cash flows without adversely impacting our operations or financial strength. We manage our liquidity to provide funds for our customers credit needs, our anticipated financial and contractual obligations, and other corporate activities. Sources of liquidity primarily include deposits, borrowings, equity, and paydowns of assets, such as loans and investment securities. For more information on our liquidity risk management practices, see Liquidity Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We have pledged collateral to the FRB s primary credit facility (or discount window) and to the BTFP, which provide additional contingent funding sources outside the normal operating hours of the FHLB and the General Collateral Funding GCF program. The BTFP offered loans of up to one year in length to eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and government mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. The availability of advances under the program ended in mid-March 2024. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the primary sources of cash came from a decrease in investment securities, an increase in deposits, and net cash provided by operating activities. Uses of cash during the same period primarily included a decrease in short-term borrowings, an increase in loans and leases, and dividends paid on common and preferred stock. Cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses were 1.4 billion and 913 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The FHLB and FRB have been, and continue to be, a significant source of back-up liquidity and funding. We are a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which allows member banks to borrow against eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements. We are required to invest in FHLB and FRB stock to maintain our borrowing capacity. At September 30, 2024, our total investment in FHLB and FRB stock was 56 million and 65 million, respectively, compared with 79 million and 65 million at December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, loans with a carrying value of 23.3 billion and 17.3 billion, compared with 24.8 billion and 11.5 billion at December 31, 2023, were pledged at the FHLB and FRB, respectively, as collateral for current and potential borrowings. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investment securities with a carrying value of 18.6 billion and 20.5 billion, respectively, were pledged as collateral for potential borrowings. For the same time periods, these pledged securities included 8.9 billion and 9.5 billion for available use through the GCF and other repo programs, 5.2 billion and 5.5 billion to the FRB and FHLB, and 4.5 billion and 5.5 billion to secure collateralized public and trust deposits, advances, and for other purposes. 
 A large portion of these pledged assets are unencumbered, but are pledged to provide immediate access to contingency sources of funds. The following schedule presents our total available liquidity including unused collateralized borrowing capacity:

 Credit Ratings 
 General financial market and economic conditions impact our access to, and cost of, external financing. Access to funding markets is also directly affected by the credit ratings we receive from various rating agencies. The ratings not only influence the costs associated with borrowings, but can also influence the sources of the borrowings. All of the credit rating agencies rate our debt at an investment-grade level. 
 The following schedule presents our credit ratings:

 Capital Management 
 A strong capital position is vital to the achievement of our key corporate objectives, our continued profitability, and to promoting depositor and investor confidence. We seek to (1) maintain sufficient capital to support the current needs and growth of our businesses, consistent with our assessment of their potential to create value for shareholders, and (2) fulfill responsibilities to depositors and bondholders while managing capital distributions to shareholders through dividends and repurchases of common stock. 
 We utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions, including the FRB s supervisory severely adverse scenario. The timing and amount of capital actions are subject to various factors, including our financial performance, business needs, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and the results of our internal stress testing, as well as Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC approval. Shares may be repurchased occasionally in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. For a more comprehensive discussion of our capital risk management, see Capital Management in our 2023 Form 10-K.

The AOCI balance was a loss of 2.3 billion at September 30, 2024, and largely reflects a decline in the fair value of fixed-rate AFS securities as a result of changes in interest rates, and includes 1.9 billion 1.4 billion after tax) of unrealized losses on the securities previously transferred from AFS to held-to-maturity HTM ). When compared to December 31, 2023, AOCI improved 356 million, primarily due to 147 million in unrealized loss amortization associated with the securities transferred from AFS to HTM, and 137 million primarily related to paydowns on AFS securities. AOCI was also impacted by a 72 million decrease in unrealized losses and other adjustments associated with derivative instruments used for risk management purposes. 
 Absent any sales or credit impairment of the AFS securities, the unrealized losses will not be recognized in earnings. We do not intend to sell any securities with unrealized losses. Although changes in AOCI are reflected in shareholders equity, they are currently excluded from regulatory capital, and therefore do not impact our regulatory ratios.

 Basel III 
 We are subject to Basel III capital requirements that include certain minimum regulatory capital ratios. At September 30, 2024, we exceeded all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules. Based on our internal stress testing and other assessments of capital adequacy, we believe we hold capital sufficiently in excess of internal and regulatory requirements for well-capitalized banks. See Supervision and Regulation and Note 15 of our 2023 Form 10-K for more information about our compliance with the Basel III capital requirements. The following schedule presents our capital amounts, capital ratios, and other selected performance ratios:

Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 5.7 , compared with 4.4 , primarily due to an increase in retained earnings and reduced unrealized losses in AOCI. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, see page 38. 
 Recent Regulatory Developments 
 During the third quarter of 2023, federal bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the Basel III Endgame, would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of 100 billion or more, and would potentially impact our current and future capital planning, including share repurchase activity. At September 30, 2024, we had 87.0 billion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposal, as we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form. 
 Federal bank regulators also issued proposals that would (1) expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of 100 billion or more, and (2) revise requirements for resolution planning. For more information about these regulatory proposals and their potential impact, see Recent Regulatory Developments in the Supervision and Regulation section of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 This Form 10-Q presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to generally accepted accounting principles GAAP financial measures. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. We consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our performance and financial position. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to assess our performance on the same basis as that applied by our management and the financial services industry. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and are not necessarily comparable to similar financial measures that may be presented by other financial services companies. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP. 
 Tangible Common Equity and Related Measures 
 Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our use of shareholders equity and provide a basis for evaluating the performance of a business more consistently, whether acquired or developed internally.

 Efficiency Ratio and Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue 
 The efficiency ratio is a measure of operating expense relative to revenue. We believe the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. We make adjustments to exclude certain items that are not generally expected to recur frequently, as identified in the subsequent schedule, which we believe allows for more consistent comparability across periods. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how we are managing our expenses. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue PPNR enables management and others to assess our ability to generate capital. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows us to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.

 Fair Value Option for Certain Loans Held for Sale 
 We have elected the fair value option for certain commercial real estate CRE loans that are intended for sale to a third-party conduit for securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments. Electing the fair value option reduces the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value, without the complexity of applying hedge accounting. These loans are included in Loans held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, and associated fair value gains and losses are included in Capital markets fees on the consolidated statement of income, while accrued interest is included in Interest and fees on loans. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million of loans measured at fair value million and million par value), respectively. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we recognized approximately million and million of net gains from loan sales and valuation adjustments of loans carried at fair value and the associated derivatives, respectively. 
 Level 3 Valuations 
 Our Level 3 financial instruments include PEIs and agriculture loan servicing. For additional information regarding our Level 3 financial instruments, including the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
 Certain assets and liabilities may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including impaired loans that have been measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate owned OREO ), and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments generally include changes in value resulting from observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, write-downs of individual assets, or the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately million of collateral-dependent loans marked to fair value and classified in Level 2. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized million of losses from fair value changes related to these loans.

 When a security is transferred from AFS to HTM, the difference between its amortized cost basis and fair value at the date of transfer is amortized as a yield adjustment through interest income, and the fair value at the date of transfer results in either a premium or discount to the amortized cost basis of the HTM securities. The amortization of unrealized gains or losses reported in AOCI will offset the effect of the amortization of the premium or discount in interest income that is created by the transfer. The discount associated with securities previously transferred from AFS to HTM was billion billion after tax) at September 30, 2024, compared with billion billion after tax) at December 31, 2023.

 Impairment 
 On a quarterly basis, we review our investment securities portfolio for the presence of impairment on an individual security basis. For additional information on our policy and impairment evaluation process for investment securities, see Note 5 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 AFS Impairment 
 We did not recognize any impairment on our AFS investment securities portfolio during the first nine months of both 2024 and 2023. Unrealized losses primarily relate to higher interest rates subsequent to the purchase of securities and are not attributable to credit; as such, absent any future sales, we would expect to receive the full principal value at maturity. At September 30, 2024, we had not initiated any sales of AFS securities, nor did we have an intent to sell any identified securities with unrealized losses. We do not believe it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. 
 HTM Impairment 
 For HTM securities, the allowance for credit losses ACL is assessed consistent with the approach described in Note 6 for loans and leases measured at amortized cost. At September 30, 2024, the ACL on HTM securities was less than million, all HTM securities were risk-graded as Pass in terms of credit quality, and none were considered past due.

 Municipal loans generally include loans to state and local governments municipalities with the debt service being repaid from general funds or pledged revenues of the municipal entity, or to private commercial entities or 501(c)(3) not-for-profit entities utilizing a pass-through municipal entity to achieve favorable tax treatment. 
 Land acquisition and development loans included in the construction and land development loan portfolio were million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 
 Loans with a carrying value of billion at September 30, 2024 and billion at December 31, 2023 have been pledged at the Federal Reserve FRB and the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Des Moines as collateral for current and potential borrowings. 
 At the time of origination, we determine the classification of loans as either held for investment or held for sale. Loans held for sale are measured at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value and primarily consist of (1) commercial real estate loans that are sold into securitization entities, and (2) conforming residential mortgages that are generally sold to U.S. government agencies. 
 Loans sold from held for sale 
 Occasionally, we have continuing involvement in the sold loans in the form of servicing rights or guarantees. The principal balance of sold loans for which we retain servicing was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Income from sold loans, excluding servicing, was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other income from loans sold includes fair value adjustments on loans that are included in Capital markets fees on the consolidated statement of income.

 Nonaccrual Loans 
 Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when payment in full of principal and interest is not expected, or the loan is 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Factors we consider in determining whether a loan is placed on nonaccrual include delinquency status, collateral value, borrower or guarantor financial statement information, bankruptcy status, and other information which would indicate that the full and timely collection of interest and principal is uncertain. 
 A nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when (1) all delinquent interest and principal become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, (2) the loan, if secured, is well-secured, (3) the borrower has paid according to the contractual terms for a minimum of six months, and (4) an analysis of the borrower indicates a reasonable assurance of the borrower's ability and willingness to maintain payments.

 For accruing loans, interest is accrued and interest payments are recognized into interest income according to the contractual loan agreement. For nonaccruing loans, the accrual of interest is discontinued, any uncollected or accrued interest is reversed from interest income in a timely manner (generally within one month), and any payments received on these loans are not recognized into interest income, but are applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding. When the collectability of the amortized cost basis for a nonaccrual loan is no longer in doubt, then interest payments may be recognized in interest income on a cash basis. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was interest income recognized on a cash basis during the period the loans were on nonaccrual.

 Closed-end loans with payments scheduled monthly are reported as past due when the borrower is in arrears for two or more monthly payments. Similarly, open-end credits, such as bankcard and other revolving credit plans, are reported as past due when the minimum payment has not been made for two or more billing cycles. Other multi-payment obligations (i.e., quarterly, semi-annual, etc.), single payment, and demand notes, are reported as past due when either principal or interest is due and unpaid for a period of 30 days or more.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 In addition to the nonaccrual and past due criteria, we also analyze loans using loan risk-grading systems, which vary based on the size and type of credit risk exposure. The internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definition of Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful, which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications. 
 Pass A Pass asset is higher-quality and does not fit any of the other categories described below. The likelihood of loss is considered low. 
 Special Mention A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in our credit position at some future date. 
 Substandard A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified have well-defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we may sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful A Doubtful asset has all the weaknesses inherent in a Substandard asset with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. 
 The amount of loans classified as Doubtful totaled million at September 30, 2024; we had loans classified as Doubtful at December 31, 2023. 
 For consumer loans and for CRE loans with commitments greater than million, we generally assign internal risk grades similar to those described previously based on automated rules that depend on refreshed credit scores, payment performance, and other risk indicators. These are generally assigned either a Pass, Special Mention, or Substandard grade, and are reviewed as we identify information that might warrant a grade change.

 million are evaluated individually, regardless of modification. 
 We consider many factors in determining whether to agree to a loan modification and we seek a solution that will both minimize potential loss to us and attempt to help the borrower. We evaluate borrowers current and forecasted future cash flows, their ability and willingness to make current contractual or proposed modified payments, the value of the underlying collateral (if applicable), the possibility of obtaining additional security or guarantees, and the potential costs related to a repossession or foreclosure and the subsequent sale of the collateral. 
 A modified loan on nonaccrual will generally remain on nonaccrual until the borrower has proven the ability to perform under the modified structure for a minimum of six months, and there is evidence that such payments can and are likely to continue as agreed. Performance prior to the modification, or significant events that coincide with the modification, are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual at the time of modification or after a shorter performance period. If the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain, the loan remains on nonaccrual. 
 On an ongoing basis, we monitor the performance of all modified loans according to their modified terms. The amortized cost of modified loans that had a payment default during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were still in default at period end, and were within 12 months or less of being modified was approximately million for both periods, primarily commercial real estate loans, and less than million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Collateral-Dependent Loans 
 When a loan is individually evaluated for expected credit losses, we estimate a specific reserve for the loan based on (1) the projected present value of the loan s future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, (2) the observable market price of the loan, or (3) the fair value of the loan s underlying collateral.

 At September 30, 2024, the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property totaled million; we had foreclosed residential real estate property at December 31, 2023.

 million that had been designated in a qualifying fair value hedge relationship of fixed-rate debt. The receive-fixed interest rate swap effectively converted the interest on our fixed-rate debt to floating until it was terminated. Prior to termination, changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of debt were offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments. The unamortized hedge basis adjustments resulting from the terminated hedging relationship are being amortized over the remaining life of the fixed-rate debt. 
 Fair Value Hedges of Assets Fair value hedges of fixed-rate assets effectively convert the fixed interest income to a floating rate on the hedged portion of the assets. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate financial assets were largely offset by changes in the value of the hedged assets, as shown in the schedules on the following pages. At September 30, 2024, we had pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate AFS securities. We had pay-fixed swaps with an additional billion of aggregate notional designated as hedges of fixed-rate commercial loans. 
 Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedges of variable-rate assets and liabilities effectively convert the variable interest receipts and payments to fixed. At September 30, 2024, we had receive-fixed, pay-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million designated as cash flow hedges of pools of floating-rate commercial loans. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had one pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap with a notional amount of million designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the interest payments on certain FHLB advances. Changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges during the quarter were recorded in AOCI as shown in the schedule below. The amounts deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings in the periods in which

 million of losses deferred in AOCI related to terminated cash flow hedges that are expected to be fully reclassified into earnings by October 2027. 
 Collateral and Credit Risk 
 Exposure to credit risk arises from the possibility of nonperformance by counterparties. No significant losses on derivative instruments have occurred as a result of counterparty nonperformance. For more information on how we incorporate counterparty credit risk in derivative valuations, see Note 3 of our 2023 Form 10-K. For additional discussion of collateral and the associated credit risk related to our derivative contracts, see Note 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Our derivative contracts require us to pledge collateral for derivatives that are in a net liability position at a given balance sheet date. Certain of these derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that include the requirement to maintain a minimum debt credit rating. We may be required to pledge additional collateral if a credit risk-related feature were triggered, such as a downgrade of our credit rating. In past situations, counterparties have not generally required that additional collateral be pledged when provided for by the contractual terms. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of our derivative liabilities was million, for which we were required to pledge cash collateral of million in the normal course of business. If our credit rating were downgraded one notch by either Standard Poor s S P or Moody s at September 30, 2024, there would likely be additional collateral required to be pledged.

 Legal Matters 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings or governmental inquiries, which may include litigation in court and arbitral proceedings, as well as investigations, examinations, and other actions brought or considered by governmental and self-regulatory agencies. Litigation may relate to lending, deposit and other customer relationships, vendor and contractual issues, employee matters, intellectual property matters, personal injuries and torts, regulatory and legal compliance, and other matters. While most matters relate to individual claims, we are also subject to putative class action claims and similar broader claims. Proceedings, investigations, examinations, and other actions brought or considered by governmental and self-regulatory agencies may relate to our banking, investment advisory, trust, securities, and other products and services; our customers involvement in money laundering, fraud, securities violations and other illicit activities or our policies and practices relating to such customer activities; and our compliance with the broad range of banking, securities and other laws and regulations applicable to us. At any given time, we may be in the process of responding to subpoenas, requests for documents, data and testimony relating to such matters and engaging in discussions to resolve the matters. 
 At September 30, 2024, we were subject to the following material litigation: 
 civil cases, Lifescan, Inc. and Johnson Johnson Health Care Services v. Jeffrey Smith, et. al. , brought against us in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in December 2017, and Roche Diagnostics and Roche Diabetes Care Inc. v. Jeffrey C. Smith, et. al. , brought against us in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in March 2019. In these cases, certain manufacturers and distributors of medical products seek to hold us liable for allegedly fraudulent practices of a borrower of the Bank who filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017. No trial has been set. 
 In the matter of Streck and Ariza v. Zions Bancorporation, N.A. , an arbitration matter pending before the American Arbitration Association, related to an employment dispute brought by former employees alleging damages arising from claims of alleged gender discrimination, retaliation, and constructive discharge. The case is in the dispositive motion phase. 
 At least quarterly, we review outstanding and new legal matters, utilizing then-available information. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, if we determine that a loss from a matter is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we establish an accrual for the loss. In the absence of such a determination, no accrual is made. Once established, accruals are adjusted to reflect developments relating to the matters. 
 79 

Table of Contents 
 ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 to approximately million in excess of amounts accrued. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate. Those matters for which a meaningful estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range and, therefore, this estimated range does not represent our maximum loss exposure. 
 Based on our current knowledge, we believe that our estimated liability for litigation and other legal actions and claims, reflected in our accruals and determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, is adequate and that liabilities in excess of the amounts currently accrued, if any, arising from litigation and other legal actions and claims for which an estimate as previously described is possible, will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, in light of the significant uncertainties involved in these matters, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for any given reporting period. 
 Any estimate or determination relating to the future resolution of litigation, arbitration, governmental or self-regulatory examinations, investigations or actions or similar matters is inherently uncertain and involves significant judgment. This is particularly true in the early stages of a legal matter, when legal issues and facts have not been well articulated, reviewed, analyzed, and vetted through discovery, preparation for trial or hearings, substantive and productive mediation or settlement discussions, or other actions. It is also particularly true with respect to class action and similar claims involving multiple defendants, matters with complex procedural requirements or substantive issues or novel legal theories, and examinations, investigations and other actions conducted or brought by governmental and self-regulatory agencies, in which the normal adjudicative process is not applicable. Accordingly, we usually are unable to determine whether a favorable or unfavorable outcome is remote, reasonably likely, or probable, or to estimate the amount or range of a probable or reasonably likely loss, until relatively late in the course of a legal matter, sometimes not until a number of years have elapsed. Accordingly, our judgments and estimates relating to claims will change from time to time in light of developments and actual outcomes will differ from our estimates. These differences may be material.

 million and billion, respectively. The net DTA or deferred tax liability DTL is included in either Other assets or Other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 We evaluate DTAs on a regular basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. In conducting this evaluation, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, based on the more-likely-than-not criteria that such assets will be realized. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
 Future reversals of existing DTLs These DTLs have a reversal pattern generally consistent with DTAs and are used to realize the DTAs. 
 Tax planning strategies We have considered prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that we would implement to preserve the value of the DTAs, if necessary. 
 Future projected taxable income We expect future taxable income will offset the reversal of remaining net DTAs. 
 Based on this evaluation, we concluded that a valuation allowance was not required at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 separately managed affiliate banks, each with its own local branding and management team, including Zions Bank, California Bank Trust, Amegy Bank, National Bank of Arizona, Nevada State Bank, Vectra Bank Colorado, and The Commerce Bank of Washington. These affiliate banks comprise our primary business segments. Performance assessment and resource allocation are based upon this geographic structure. Our affiliate banks are supported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the Other segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates capital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated through our affiliate banks. 
 We allocate the cost of centrally provided services to the business segments based upon estimated or actual usage of those services. We also allocate capital based on the risk-weighted assets held at each business segment. We use an internal funds transfer pricing FTP allocation process to report results of operations for business segments. This process is subject to change and refinement over time. Total average loans and deposits presented for the business segments include insignificant intercompany amounts between business segments and may also include deposits with the Other segment. 
 At September 30, 2024, Zions Bank operated branches in Utah, branches in Idaho, and branch in Wyoming. CB T operated branches in California. Amegy operated branches in Texas. NBAZ operated branches in Arizona. NSB operated branches in Nevada. Vectra operated branches in Colorado and branch in New Mexico. TCBW operated branches in Washington and branch in Oregon. 
 On September 23, 2024, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to purchase FirstBank Coachella Valley, California branches and their associated deposit and loan accounts. These branches will be operated by our CB T affiliate bank. In addition to the branches, the purchase includes approximately million in deposits and million in commercial and consumer loans. These amounts are subject to change. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. 
 Transactions between business segments are primarily conducted at fair value, resulting in profits that are eliminated for reporting consolidated results of operations. The following schedule presents average loans, average deposits, and income before income taxes because we use these metrics when evaluating performance and making decisions pertaining to the business segments. The condensed statement of income identifies the components of income and expense which affect the operating amounts presented in the Other segment.

The Administrator or Sponsor shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any such claim. The Administrator and Sponsor shall give reasonable assistance to the Trustee in defense of any claim, at the Trustee's expense. The Trustee shall have sole control of the defense of any such claim. To the extent that any Electronic Services utilize Internet services to transport data or communications, the Trustee will take, and the Administrator and Sponsor agree to follow, reasonable security precautions. However, the Trustee disclaims any liability for interception of any such data or communications. The Trustee reserves the right not to accept data or communications transmitted electronically or via electronic media by the Sponsor or a third party if it determines that the method of delivery does not provide adequate data security, or if it is not administratively feasible for the Trustee to use the data security provided. The Trustee shall not be responsible for, and makes no warranties regarding access, speed or availability of Internet or network services, or any other service required for electronic communication, nor does the Trustee make any warranties, express or implied, and specifically disclaims all warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

excused from performance to the extent Client withholds necessary information. Neither Party will sell or lease the other Party s Confidential Information. 
 
 A Party may disclose the other Party s Confidential Information as required to respond to any valid subpoena, court order, litigation, or regulatory request, or satisfy any legal requirement, provided, to the extent not legally prohibited, such Party advises the other Party prior to disclosure so the other Party may act as it considers appropriate.

 The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all information provided and all Participant communications prepared and delivered by the Administrator or the Trustee during the implementation period prior to the execution date of this Agreement and throughout the term set forth in this Agreement. 
 c. Survival. 
 
 Trustee s and Sponsor's respective obligations under this Agreement, which by their nature would continue beyond the termination of this Agreement, including but not limited to those contained in Sections 6(c), 8(e), 17, and 19, shall survive any termination of the Agreement. 
 
 d. Merger. 
 
 The Trustee possesses the specific authority to, at the direction of the Named Fiduciary, execute any instrument necessary to effect Plan asset transfers with trustees of other trusts exempt from tax under 
 30 

Code 501(a) and which are part of retirement plans described in Code 401(a) whether or not sponsored by the Sponsor and to accept the direct transfer of Plan assets, or to transfer Plan assets, as a party to any such agreement, provided that the Trustee shall not be obligated to receive any direct transfer unless prior thereto or coincident therewith, as the Trustee may specify to the Named Fiduciary in writing, the Trustee has received such reconciliation, allocation, investment or other information concerning, or such direction, contribution or representation with respect to, the contribution or transfer or the source thereof as the Trustee may require. 
 
 This Trust may be merged or consolidated with, or its assets or liabilities may be transferred to, any other trust only if the benefits which would be received by each Participant in the Plan, in the event of a termination of the Plan immediately after such merger, consolidation or transfer, are at least equal to the benefits the Participant would have received if the Plan had terminated immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer. 
 The Trustee may accept a direct transfer of assets on behalf of an individual Participant only if first authorized by the Administrator. In the event of a direct transfer the Trustee shall hold, administer and distribute transferred assets as a part of the Trust Fund for the benefit of the Participant on whose behalf the Trustee has accepted the transfer in a manner sufficient to reflect the value of the transferred assets. 
 viii. Advice Services 
 
 With respect to any Plan designated as a defined contribution plan and that is subject to Title I of ERISA, if Fidelity provides to Participants or Plan beneficiaries Services that constitute fiduciary investment advice that is subject to ERISA 3(21), Fidelity will 
 
 a. to the extent Fidelity provides advice to Participants or Plan beneficiaries regarding investment of their account, only recommend products and or services from investment options available under the Plan recordkept by Fidelity as outlined in disclosures provided to Participants from time to time and made available to Client and 
 b. to the extent it provides advice regarding plan distributions, only recommend the following retaining balance in the Plan, roll over to another eligible plan recordkept by Fidelity, and or rollover to a Fidelity Individual Retirement Account and 
 c. only provide point-in-time recommendations and investment assistance and has no obligation to monitor any such recommendation to determine whether it is followed by such Participant or Plan beneficiary or should change over time, and will provide each Participant or Plan beneficiary with information on how to contact Fidelity to obtain updated or new recommendations and 
 d. to the extent necessary to avoid a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and or the Internal Revenue Code, rely on one or more exemptions that may apply to its provision of investment advice, potentially including the following - i) the Pension Protection Act computer model and or level fee exemptions under Section 408(b)(14) and 408(g) of ERISA and Labor Regs. Section 2550.408g-1 ii) Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 2020-02, Improving Investment Advice for Workers & Retirees and iii) other exemptions that exist under applicable law, now or in the future. The advice arrangements subject to 408(b)(14) and 408(g) of ERISA and Labor regulations 2550.408g-1 will be audited annually by an independent auditor for compliance with the requirements of the statutory exemption and related regulations. A copy of the auditor s findings will be made available within 60 days following completion of the audit. Client agrees that Fidelity may provide advice to Participants pursuant to these exemptions. 
 31 

Furthermore, with respect to any Plan designated as a defined contribution plan that is not subject to Title I of ERISA, Fidelity may make education and guidance Services available to Plan Participants that may include investment advice (as defined under the Investment Advisers Act or other applicable law) and cause Fidelity to be considered a fiduciary with respect to such Services. If any such Plan is not subject to ERISA because it is excluded from coverage under Title I of ERISA by virtue of the Department of Labor's regulation at 29 C.F.R 2510.3-2(f), the Client will not be considered by Fidelity to be arranging for or endorsing any advice, or establishing or maintaining a retirement plan. 
 
 Section 19. Use of Data. 
 
 In order to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, the Trustee may receive Personal Data. With respect to Personal Data it receives, the Trustee agrees to (i) safeguard Personal Data in accordance with its privacy policy, and (ii) exercise the same standard of care in safeguarding such Personal Data that it uses to protect the personal data of its own employees. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may monitor the Trustee's interactions with Participants and the Administrator authorizes the Trustee to permit third-party prospects of the Trustee to monitor Participants' interactions for the purpose of evaluating Trustee's services. 
 
 i. Data Security. Trustee will follow the information security practices detailed in the Information Security Program (as may be updated by Trustee from time to time), made available to Sponsor through PSW or other electronic means and the attached Schedule I - Information Security Schedule. 
 
 ii. Restrictions on Use of Personal Data. Trustee s privacy information management system governing the privacy of Personal Data in support of the DC service line is aligned and certified to the ISO 27701 framework. To provide assurances about its privacy governance framework, Trustee will make available its current ISO 27701 certification. Trustee will treat Personal Data in accordance with its Privacy Policy and the Consumer Privacy Rights Addendum (as may be updated by Trustee from time to time), made available to the Administrator through PSW or other electronic means. Trustee will only use Personal Data as the Administrator authorizes, including as provided under this Agreement, or in response to a Participant s expression of a need or interest in a Fidelity product or service, or as the Participant otherwise permits. 
 
 iii. Data Conditions. Sponsor represents that all data and documentation, including employee data and or participant data (the Data provided to Trustee to be used in performing the services under this Agreement shall be provided in a timely manner, in good condition, correct, complete and submitted in accordance with Trustee s specifications (such specifications to be provided to the Sponsor by the Trustee from time to time) and guidelines, including the Reference Guidelines developed by the Trustee with respect to Content to be posted on NetBenefits. Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of such data and shall have (i) no liability for inaccuracies in Data originating from Sponsor, the Sponsor participants or Sponsor s third party service providers, (ii) no duty to verify such information except where the data is clearly erroneous on its face, and (iii) no responsibility for Content posted on NetBenefits. If any data is not submitted in accordance with these requirements, or if Trustee detects errors or omissions in the data 
 32 

submitted, Trustee shall promptly notify Sponsor and return such data to Sponsor for correction and modification unless (i) Sponsor and Trustee agree, in writing, that Trustee is to make corrections or modifications to the data for an additional fee, or (ii) the Sponsor will provide prompt direction as necessary to correct any errors or omissions in the Data. The Trustee may remove, edit or modify Content that does not comply with the Reference Guidelines. For purposes of these requirements and except to the extent such treatment would be inconsistent with applicable law, Trustee may treat scanned electronic copies of paper records as the official records. 
 
 iv. Customer Protection. Trustee maintains controls (e.g., two factor authentication and real-time security alerts) designed to protect Participants against risks of identity theft and fraud. To decrease such risks, Trustee requires Participant contact information (such as address, email, and mobile phone number). Sponsor authorizes Trustee to collect such information from Participants at registration or periodically thereafter and shall timely provide Trustee such information on request, as Trustee may be unable to administer such controls without such information. If either Party becomes aware of security concerns regarding a Participant s account, Sponsor will reasonably assist Trustee in the investigation. 
 
 Section 20. Governing Law. 
 
 i. Massachusetts Law Controls. 
 
 This Agreement is being made in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the Trust shall be administered as a Massachusetts trust. The validity, construction, effect, and administration of this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, except to the extent those laws are superseded under section 514 of ERISA. 
 
 ii. Trust Agreement Controls. 
 
 The Trustee is not a party to the Plan, and in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the trust provisions of this Agreement, the trust provisions of this Agreement shall control. 
 
 Section 21. Plan Qualification. 
 
 The Plan is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code and the Trust established hereunder is intended to be tax-exempt under section 501(a) of the Code. The Sponsor represents that to the extent Participants are able to instruct the investment of their account, the Plan is intended to constitute a plan described in section 404(c) of ERISA and Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 2550.404c- 
 
 The Sponsor has the sole responsibility for ensuring the Plan's qualified status and full compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA. The Sponsor hereby certifies that it has furnished to the Trustee a complete copy of the Plan and all amendments thereto in effect as of the date of this Agreement. 
 
 Section 22. Use of Omnibus Accounts. 
 
 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Sponsor understands, acknowledges and agrees that, (i) the Trustee utilizes omnibus accounts at unaffiliated banks to facilitate transactions for 
 33 

the defined contribution plans it services and commingles funds in transit to or from the Plan, including other funds similarly in transit to or from other plans and (ii) if markets permit, omnibus account balances may be invested in short-term investments with the aim of earning a rate approximating the Target Federal Funds Rate and or money market rates (such earnings are referred to as float earnings and (iii) the Trustee will use these earnings to pay bank fees associated with the above-referenced defined contribution plan transactions and make other required adjustments and will retain any float earnings that exceed such fees and adjustments as compensation for its services, except as otherwise set forth in Schedule B, Fee Schedule. The Trustee shall pay bank fees to the extent they exceed float earnings. 
 
 The amount of float earnings generated depends on market conditions, as well as on the length of time that funds are held in the omnibus accounts. The following time frames apply with respect to funds held in these accounts 
 
 If contributions and instructions to purchase investment options are received by the Trustee In Good Order before the close of trading, the Trustee executes transactions in the investment options as of that day s closing price (the transaction date or T ). Contributions are held in the omnibus account until the following business day T+1 for the vast majority of investment options. For share accounted company stock transactions, contributions may be held in the omnibus account until T+3. 
 Instructions to exchange investment options received by the Trustee In Good Order before the close of trading are processed in that day s nightly cycle. For the vast majority of investment options, exchanges generate no overnight balances, as money is received from one investment option and conveyed to another investment option on the same business day. The limited exceptions to this would occur if investment options have different settlement rules and Fidelity Management Trust Company serves as trustee of the Plan, in which case balances attributable to the exchange may remain in an omnibus account for a few days. 
 Instructions to make disbursements received In Good Order before the close of trading are processed in that day s nightly cycle and reflected as debits from participant accounts as of that date T ). Proceeds attributable to the disbursement are received into the omnibus account based on the settlement period for the investment options, which in the substantial majority of investment options is T+1. After the deduction of tax withholding, if applicable, disbursements are typically made on T+2 or T+3 either through electronic funds transfers or by mailing a check. Disbursement proceeds distributed by check, net of any tax withholdings, remain in the omnibus account until the check is presented for payment. 
 
 Neither the Sponsor nor the Plan shall be liable for any diminution in the value of such overnight investments. Provided that the Sponsor has provided timely funding, neither the Sponsor nor the Plan shall be responsible for any failure to settle or clear from such omnibus accounts any proper or timely trade or disbursement if such failure results from a decrease in the value, or temporary inaccessibility of funds attributable to either the use of a specific bank or the overnight investment of balances from such accounts. 
 
 Section 23. Investment Management Communications. 
 
 Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator and Sponsor hereby authorize the Trustee and affiliates of the Trustee, throughout the term of this Agreement and any extensions thereto, to provide Participants with communications related to workplace and or personal investment management products or services. The Trustee and affiliates of the Trustee may use for such 
 34 

purpose any information received hereunder or otherwise related to the Plan or Sponsor all such information collected or used shall be treated in accordance with Fidelity Investments' privacy policy. 
 35

 Portfolios are also monitored each Business Day to ensure that any Participant directed activities (such as withdrawals or loans) have not caused the Participant Account to vary from the assigned market-adjusted model portfolio by more than a standard drift allowance set by Strategic Advisers. 
 
 2) Rebalance transactions will be created in the nightly cycle for processing on the following Business Day and will be reflected in Participant Accounts on the day following the rebalance transaction date. 
 ii. Reallocation of Model Portfolios . If there is a reallocation of the model portfolio (resulting from review of the Plan s investment options or a change in the Plan investment option menu), those Participant Accounts that vary from the revised model portfolio by more than a standard drift allowance set by Strategic Advisers will be flagged for reallocation. Reallocation transactions will be processed using the same rules as for rebalance transactions. 
 iii. Changes to Investor Profile . If a change in model portfolios is required as a result of an annual or ad hoc review of the Participant s investor profile completed before Market Close on a Business Day, the required exchanges shall be processed within the next 5 Business Days, and reflected in the Participant s Account within three Business Days. 
 iv. Termination of Service . If receipt of a Participant s election to terminate Personalized Planning & Advice is confirmed before Market Close, the Account will not be flagged for rebalancing or reallocation, and any pending rebalance or reallocation transactions will be automatically cancelled. If receipt of a Participant s election to terminate Personalized Planning & Advice is confirmed after Market Close, and an exchange is then pending for processing in the nightly cycle for such date, such exchanges shall be processed as of the Market Close on such date.

Schedule A to Investment Management Agreement (FPPA) 
 Fees for Managed Account Service 
 
 Plan Name Zions Bancorporation, N.A. Payshelter 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
 Plan Number 29148 
 
 Beginning upon the Plan s enrollment in the Managed Account Service, the annual advisory fee for the Managed Account Service will be assessed based on a percentage of the average daily balance of Managed Assets of enrolled Participants. The advisory fee will be charged to cover ongoing management of the Managed Assets, and related servicing and Participant communication. The fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and will be calculated on the basis of daily Participant balances, generally on the 25 th day of the last month of the Participant statement cycle quarter (or the next Business Day if the 25 th is not a Business Day). 
 
 Unless paid by the Sponsor, the Trustee or its agent will redeem investments in the amount of the net advisory fee directly from enrolled Participants Plan accounts on the Business Day following the fee calculation. The amount of the fee deducted from a Participant s account will be noted on the Participant s statement. 
 
 The annual net advisory fee for the Managed Account Service will be calculated by deducting a Plan Credit Amount (as defined below) from the Plan s annual gross advisory fee set forth in the table below. 
 ANNUAL GROSS ADVISORY FEE SCHEDULE 
 Average Daily Balance of Managed Assets Less Than 20 Eligible Participant Enrollment Equal to, or Greater Than, 20 Eligible Participant Enrollment 1 For the first 100,000 in assets, or portion thereof 0.55 0.50 For the next 150,000 in assets, or portion thereof 0.50 0.40 All assets over 250,000 0.35 0.25 
 The Gross Advisory fees applicable to plans that exceed 20 enrollment will take effect beginning with the first day of the quarter in which the 20 threshold was exceeded. 
 
 Plan Credit Amount and Net Advisory Fee. The purpose of the Plan Credit Amount is to reduce the annual gross advisory fee payable by the Plan by the amount of asset-based fees, if any, Strategic Advisers or its affiliates receive for management of Fidelity Mutual Funds in which Managed Assets are invested, and for other services related to any other investment option offered under the Plan in which Managed Assets are invested. 
 This Plan Credit Amount will be calculated daily in the following manner For each investment option in which Managed Assets are invested, an amount will be calculated equal to the sum of (a) the actual underlying investment management fees paid to Strategic Advisers or its affiliates from such investment if it is a Fidelity Mutual Fund (but not other fund expenses such as transfer agency fees) and (b) the servicing or other fees paid to and retained by Strategic Advisers and its affiliates based on assets or Participants in any investment option other than Fidelity Mutual Funds. The resulting amounts for all investments of Managed Assets will be added together to arrive at the Plan Credit Amount. The Plan Credit Amount will be applied (as a percentage) equally across all Participant accounts to arrive at the annual net advisory fee for that Participant. It is expected that the Plan Credit Amount will vary over time, based upon the funds selected for investment of Managed Assets. 
 In the event a Participant's participation in the Managed Account Service is terminated before the end of a quarter but such Participant remains enrolled in the Plan, the gross advisory fee applicable to that quarter will be prorated based on the number of days the account was managed during the quarter, and such Participant's net advisory fees for the pro-rated quarter will be calculated using the Plan Credit Amount applicable to the prior quarter. 
 If, prior to the end of a billing quarter, either, (a) a Participant's participation in the Managed Account Service is terminated simultaneously with that Participant's enrollment in the Plan, or (b) the Plan terminates the Managed Account Service in its entirety, then the gross advisory fee applicable to that quarter will be prorated based on the number of days the account was managed during the quarter. In such cases, a Participant's gross advisory fees for the pro-rated quarter will be reduced by a 

credit amount equal to (a) the actual underlying investment management fees paid to Strategic Advisers or its affiliates from investments in such Participant's account for Fidelity Mutual Funds (but not other fund expenses such as transfer agency fees) and (b) the servicing or other fees paid to and retained by Strategic Advisers and its affiliates based on assets from such Participant's account invested in any investment option other than Fidelity Mutual Funds. 
 As noted above, the Plan's annual gross advisory fee has been determined based on the composition of the Plan's available investment options. The Plan's annual gross advisory fee has been set at a level that, when reduced by the Plan Credit Amount, should result in Participants paying approximately the annual target net fee shown below. Note that, because the Plan Credit Amount will vary over time, the actual amount of net advisory fee paid by any Participant will vary based upon, among other things, the funds selected for investment by the Service and the number and asset allocations of Participants enrolled in the Plan. As a result, a Participant's net advisory fee may be higher or lower than the target net advisory shown in the table below 
 TARGET ANNUAL NET ADVISORY FEE SCHEDULE 
 Average daily account balance 
 Less than 20 eligible participant enrollment 
 Greater than 20 eligible participant enrollment 
 For the first 100,000 or portion thereof 
 0.50 
 0.45 
 For the next 100,000 to 250,000, or portion thereof 
 0.45 
 0.35 
 All additional assets over 250,000 
 0.30 
 0.20 

As noted above, the Plan Credit Amount and annual net advisory fee will vary over time. However, given the investment options available in the Plan as of the date of this Agreement and expected rates of enrollment in the Service, Strategic Advisers anticipates that the annual net advisory fees paid by any Participant in the Plan will fall within the ranges shown below. 
 
 TARGET RANGE OF ANNUAL NET ADVISORY FEES 
 
 Average daily account balance 
 Less than 20 eligible participant enrollment 
 Greater than 20 eligible participant enrollment 
 For the first 100,000 or portion thereof 
 0.55 - 0.45 
 0.50 -0.40 
 For the next 100,000 to 250,000, or portion thereof 
 0.50 -0.40 
 0.40 -0.30 
 All additional assets over 250,000 
 0.35 -0.25 
 0.25 -0.15 

In rare circumstances, due to the variable nature of the Plan Credit Amount, the net advisory fee payable by Participants may fall outside of the ranges shown above. 
 
 The annual net advisory fee shall be charged in addition to any applicable management fees, purchase fee, short-term trading fee, or similar fee payable to the applicable mutual fund, or any fee paid to Strategic Advisers or its affiliates for services rendered to the Plan (including trustee or recordkeeping services) or to the investment options offered under the Plan. 
 
 Note Should the Sponsor or Authorizing Party modify the investment options available through the Plan, Strategic Advisers shall have the right to modify this pricing schedule upon sixty (60) days' notice. 
 
 From time to time, Strategic Advisers may provide a pricing incentive to encourage enrollment in the service. Unless otherwise specified, the pricing incentives will either allow eligible Plan participants who are not enrolled in the service to have the Service free of Advisory Fees for a stated period of time, or will allow eligible participants who are not enrolled in the service a stated discount from the plan's Gross Advisory fee during a specified period. The Authorizing Party will receive prior notice of any pricing incentive. In the unlikely event that the Plan Credit Amount exceeds the Gross Advisory Fees for any quarter in which a pricing incentive is in effect, the excess shall be added to the Plan Credit Amount for the following quarter. In such event, no new pricing incentives will be initiated until any previously unused Plan Credit Amount has been used to offset Gross Advisory Fees. In the event that there is unused Plan Credit Amounts for three successive quarters, the amount shall be converted to a Service Credit, which may be applied exclusively for any Plan-related service obtained by the Plan from Strategic Advisers or any Strategic Advisers affiliate that would otherwise be payable under the terms of existing agreements (other than non-SAI investment management fees, expenses already deducted from Participant accounts, or expenses incorporated into a mil rate). The Service Credit will be credited to a non-interest bearing hypothetical account in respect of the Plan, and will expire twelve months after the end of the quarter in which it was credited. 

Schedule B to Investment Management Agreement (FPPA) 
 Investment Guidelines for Fidelity Personalized Planning & Advice 
 
 In providing discretionary management, Strategic Advisers shall manage Managed Assets in an enrolled Participant s Account by selecting from among the Investment Options in order to provide diversification appropriate for the enrolled Participant. Strategic Advisers will allocate the Participant s portfolio across various asset classes to try to achieve the long-term goal of seeking an appropriate level of returns for a given level of risk. 
 FPWA shall assign the Participant to an appropriate asset mix based on the appropriate risk reward trade-offs for the Participant. To determine the appropriate mix, FPWA will consider the Participant s date of birth, assumed retirement age, Account balance, and other personal information provided by the recordkeeper or by the Participant directly through a series of questions or through the incorporation of available online information. This profile information may include the Participant s risk preferences, investment experience, current and future income, and potential withdrawal needs, depending on the availability of such information and the willingness of the Participant to provide such information. It may also include information about assets held by the Participant in other accounts (including amounts held in other plans or accounts serviced by its Affiliates) and the asset allocation of these accounts. FPWA will base its proposed asset mix on the amount of information provided by the Participant but shall not require information from the Participant beyond (i) correct date of birth information for each plan Participant, and (ii) designating the expected retirement age for each Participant. 
 Strategic Advisers shall design model portfolios for the plan by selecting a combination of Investment Options that track the risk and diversification attributes of the targeted asset allocation within an appropriate range. Based on the information outlined above, FPWA will assign the Participant to one of the model portfolios. 
 Sponsor or the Authorizing Party has chosen the Managed Account Service s core investment management approach (the core approach for the management of Managed Assets of enrolled Participants. The core approach evaluates all eligible Investment Options, including actively managed funds, index-based funds, and extended asset class investment strategies when building portfolios. The Managed Account Service chosen by Sponsor and or the Authorizing Party employs active asset allocation as part of this investment process. Strategic Advisers active asset allocation process attempts to adjust the long-term asset allocation of the portfolios to increase return potential and or diversification benefits by applying research-driven primary asset class weightings. Please see Terms and Conditions brochure for the Managed Account Service for more information. 

Participant asset allocations generally will be reviewed three to six times per year, and a Participant may be reassigned to an asset allocation that matches his or her updated profile. A Participant may be reassigned to an appropriate asset allocation and portfolio any time the Participant informs FPWA and Strategic Advisers of a change to his or her profile. 
 Authorizing Party shall be responsible for providing correct date of birth information for each Participant. In addition, if the Participant does not provide information designating their expected retirement date, the Authorizing Party will either (i) provide a default retirement date to be used in scoring Participants or (ii) direct FPWA and Strategic Advisers to use the default retirement date designated by the Social Security Administration for such Participant. 
 Strategic Advisers shall invest eligible amounts held in, or contributed to, the accounts of enrolled Participants in accordance with the model portfolio, as it may be adjusted from time to time for market fluctuation, provided that Strategic Advisers shall not manage amounts held in Sponsor Stock (if applicable), or contributions required to be invested in Sponsor Stock, except to counterbalance against such Sponsor Stock as described below. Enrolled Participant Accounts may be rebalanced periodically to align their Accounts to their assigned model portfolio, or if their Accounts drift materially from the market-adjusted model portfolio designated by Strategic Advisers. Strategic Advisers may change the model portfolios as appropriate for changes in the Investment Options, market performance, or economic conditions. 
 FPWA and Strategic Advisers shall have no independent obligation under this IMA to value assets under its management but shall instead rely upon valuations provided by the trustee, custodian, recordkeeper or its agent, or an external money manager, if applicable. 
 Special Guidelines for Sponsor Stock Holdings (if applicable) Strategic Advisers will not invest Managed Assets in Sponsor Stock. An enrolled Participant whose Account is invested in Sponsor Stock will be offered the choice whether to (i) have FPWA ignore such holdings in assigning an asset allocation to the Participant or (ii) assign an asset allocation that attempts to offset the risk characteristics associated with an investment in a security. If a Participant elects to offset the Sponsor Stock holdings, FPWA will assign the Participant to a portfolio that attempts to account for their holdings in Sponsor Stock, based on the Participant s level of Sponsor Stock holdings in their Account. If a Participant fails to direct Strategic Advisers as to whether to offset or ignore his or her Sponsor Stock positions, the Authorizing Party hereby directs FPWA to assign the Participant into a portfolio that attempts to offset 

the risk characteristics of the Participant s Sponsor Stock position. 
 Strategic Advisers will not make decisions with respect to the exercise of any rights accruing to Investment Options including, without limitation, shareholder rights to vote proxies or tender or exchange shares, or rights arising out of bankruptcy or litigation. Decisions with respect to the exercise of any such rights shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Trust, and Strategic Advisers shall not be required to take such matters into account in making its investment decisions. 
 Managed Assets of enrolled Participants may be invested in any Investment Options available for new investment by enrolled Participants other than assets held in or investment options available in self-directed brokerage accounts (and Sponsor Stock, if applicable) subject to the restrictions described below. 
 To the extent a Participant is enrolled in more than one Account within the Managed Account Service, FPWA and Strategic Advisers will share such Participant data across Accounts and Plans. FPWA and Strategic Advisers will use such Participant s data provided in connection with one Account for updating or management purposes in other Accounts of such Participant that are also managed by the Managed Account Service. 
 Managed Assets of enrolled Participants will not be invested in any core Investment Option that is closed to new investment by eligible Participants. Certain investments such as investment strategy options may be excluded from the model portfolio construction process. The Authorizing Party shall have the right to impose reasonable restrictions upon Strategic Advisers with respect to investment management, other than those set out here, provided that it shall first propose such restrictions in writing to Strategic Advisers, and provided that Strategic Advisers shall have thirty (30) business days to determine whether such restriction is reasonable. 
 To the extent that the Authorizing Party or Sponsor has determined to allow Participants who have self-directed brokerage assets to invest in the Managed Account Service, any self-directed brokerage assets held by the Participant will not be included in the Managed Assets. In addition, all future contributions into the Participant Account will be directed 

into the portion of the Participant s Account to be managed by Strategic Advisers. Participants will have the opportunity, if they choose, to reinvest assets from their self-directed brokerage account into the portion of the Participant s Account to be managed by Strategic Advisers, but such participants will not have the option of withdrawing such assets to reinvest through their self-directed brokerage account. 
 With respect to any stable value option or custom fund option within a Plan lineup, Strategic Advisers will use such stable value option as the short-term position in constructing its portfolios. The Authorizing Party shall be responsible for obtaining the approval of the stable value option or custom fund provider prior to the implementation of the Managed Account Service. 
 The Managed Account Service will only consider Fidelity Mutual Funds if such funds have been selected by Sponsor or the Authorizing Party and included in the Plan Investment Options offered to Participants and beneficiaries. To the extent that the Managed Account Service includes one or more Fidelity Mutual Funds in model portfolios utilized by Participants, Strategic Advisers believes such fund or funds are appropriate because each such fund is an Investment Option that, in combination with other Investment Options in the model portfolio, provide a resulting portfolio that tracks the risk and diversification attributes of the targeted asset allocation. Strategic Advisers constructs and manages each model portfolio by applying a quantitative investment methodology. In constructing model portfolios, Strategic Advisers employs a process that is independent with respect to fund family or investment manager. 
 In addition to the discretionary investment management services described above, through the Managed Account Service FPWA provides non-discretionary, web-based and representative-led financial planning and participant assistance. This financial planning is designed to help enrolled Participants who wish to create, implement, and track a holistic, integrated financial wellness and retirement plan. A team of FPWA advisors will be available to provide ongoing support and to help enrolled participants with financial planning and the servicing of their Managed Assets in their Account. In general, FPWA advisors will only be available via telephone or web access. 

These Investment Guidelines may be changed upon sixty (60) days written notice to the Authorizing Party
