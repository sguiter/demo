 under the Maryland General Corporation Law for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in student housing and senior housing real estate investments. The Company s year-end is December 31. As used in these consolidated financial statements, we, us, our, and Company refer to Strategic Student Senior Housing Trust, Inc. and each of our subsidiaries. Offering Related On October 4, 2016, our Advisor, as defined below, acquired shares of our common stock for and became our initial stockholder. On January 27, 2017, pursuant to a confidential private placement memorandum (the Private Placement Memorandum ), we commenced a private offering of up to in shares of our common stock (the Primary Private Offering and shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (collectively, the Private Offering and together with the Public Offering described below, the Offerings ). The Private Offering required a minimum offering amount of . On August 4, 2017, we met such minimum offering requirement. Our Private Offering terminated on March 15, 2018. We raised offering proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of approximately million shares pursuant to the Private Offering. On May 1, 2018, our registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-220646) (the Registration Statement was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The Registration Statement registered up to billion in shares of common stock for sale to the public (the Primary Offering consisting of three classes of shares Class A shares, Class T shares, and Class W shares and up to in shares of common stock for sale pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (together with the Primary Offering, the Public Offering ). Concurrently with our Registration Statement being declared effective, we filed articles of amendment to our charter and articles supplementary to our charter. As a result, all shares issued in our Private Offering were redesignated as Class A shares and the authorized shares under our charter were reclassified among Class A shares and two new classes of shares, Class T shares and Class W shares. On June 21, 2019, we suspended the sale of Class A shares, Class T shares, and Class W shares in the Primary Offering and filed a post-effective amendment to our Registration Statement to register two new classes of common stock (Class Y shares and Class Z shares) with the SEC. On July 10, 2019, the post-effective amendment to our Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC. Also on July 10, 2019, we filed articles supplementary to our charter which reclassified certain authorized and unissued shares of our common stock into Class Y shares and Class Z shares. Effective as of July 10, 2019, we began offering Class Y shares (up to million in shares) and Class Z shares (up to million in shares) in our Primary Offering. The Class Y shares and Class Z shares have similar voting rights and rights upon liquidation to the Class A shares, Class T shares, and Class W shares, although distributions are expected to differ because of the stockholder servicing fee associated with the Class Y shares and the dealer manager servicing fee associated with the Class Z shares. Through our Primary Offering, we raised offering proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of approximately Class A shares, approximately Class T shares, approximately Class W shares, approximately million Class Y shares, and approximately Class Z shares. On March 30, 2020, our board of directors approved the suspension of our distributions which included the distribution reinvestment plan and shares have been issued subsequently. Through our distribution reinvestment plan, we have issued approximately Class A shares, approximately Class T shares, approximately Class W shares, approximately Class Y shares, and approximately Class Z shares for gross proceeds of approximately million. On March 30, 2020, our board of directors approved the suspension of the Primary Offering based upon various factors, including the uncertainty relating to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on us and our overall financial results. Our board of directors also approved the suspension of our share redemption program (see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies for additional detail) and the suspension of distributions to our stockholders, both of which remain suspended as of September 30, 2024. The termination of our Primary Offering occurred on May 1, 2021. Primarily as a result of the termination of our Primary Offering, we currently do not have the equity capital needed to acquire additional properties at this time and we are focusing our efforts on managing our existing properties. Subsequent to March 31, 2020, sales were made pursuant to the Primary Offering. On January 22, 2024, our board of directors, upon recommendation of our nominating and corporate governance committee, approved an estimated value per share of for our Class A shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y

We bill on a monthly basis, which is generally due at the beginning of the month. Additionally, at our senior housing properties our managers provide certain ancillary services to residents that are not contemplated in the lease agreement with each resident (primarily community fees and to a lesser extent guest meals, etc.). These services are provided and paid for in addition to the standard items included in each resident lease. Such items are billed on a monthly basis and are generally due at the beginning of the month. The majority of our revenues are derived from lease and lease related revenues, and the majority of such revenue is not subject to the revenue recognition guidance ASC Topic 606 under GAAP. The revenues derived from our leases are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 842. Additionally, we have elected to adopt a practical expedient not to separate lease and nonlease components, which can only be applied to leasing arrangements for which (i) the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the lease and nonlease components and (ii) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. Under this practical expedient, contracts that are predominantly lease-based would be accounted for under ASC Topic 842, and contracts that are predominantly service-based would be accounted for under ASC Topic 606. Lease and nonlease revenue components that are accounted for within the scope of ASC Topic 842 are: Student leasing revenues recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Other lease related revenues recognized in the period earned. 

 Senior leasing revenues are recorded monthly pursuant to the agreements with our residents. The majority of such revenue is attributable to the portion of the base monthly lease fee related to the non-service component of the lease. The service component of the base monthly lease fee is also recognized pursuant to ASC Topic 842 as they are not the predominate component, the service timing and pattern of the service components are the same as the lease component, and the lease component, if separately accounted for, would be classified as an operating lease.

 of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class W shares towards payment of organization and offering expenses, which we recognized as a capital contribution from our Advisor. Additionally, our Advisor funded, and was not reimbursed for organization and offering costs up to an amount equal to of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares sold in our Public Offering, which we recognized as a capital contribution from our Advisor. Our Advisor must reimburse us within days after the end of the month in which the Public Offering terminated to the extent organization and offering expenses incurred in good faith in connection with the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares exceed the estimate being funded by the Advisor. Conversely, must reimburse our Advisor within days after the end of the month in which the Public Offering terminated to the extent such organization and offering expenses are less than the estimate being funded by the Advisor. If at any point in time we determine that the organization and offering costs incurred in connection with the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares are expected to exceed of the gross proceeds anticipated to be received from the sale of such shares, we will recognize such excess as a receivable from our Advisor and a corresponding capital contribution from our Advisor. If we determine that the organization and offering costs incurred in connection with the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares are expected to be less than of the gross proceeds anticipated to be received from the sale of such shares, we will recognize such difference as a payable to our Advisor and a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Offering costs associated with the Primary Offering were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital, and organization costs were recorded in general and administrative expenses. Subsequent to the termination of our Public Offering on May 1, 2021, no additional adjustment was required. In connection with our Primary Offering, our Former Dealer Manager received an upfront sales commission and dealer manager fee based upon the share class sold under the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement, which are recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as an offering cost. Our Advisor agreed to fund the payment of the upfront sales commission and the upfront dealer manager fee for the sale of Class Y shares sold in the Primary Offering, which we recognized as a capital contribution from our Advisor. In addition, our Former Dealer Manager also received an ongoing stockholder servicing fee and ongoing dealer manager fee for certain classes of our common stock, subject to certain limitations. We record a liability within due to affiliates and a reduction to additional paid-in capital at the time of sale of the Class T, Class W, Class Y, and Class Z shares for the future estimated ongoing stockholder and dealer manager servicing fees. Please see Note 9 Related Party Transactions Dealer Manager Agreements for additional details about such commissions and fees.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we held an interest rate hedge to hedge our interest rate exposure (See Notes 5 Debt and Debt held for Sale and 6 Derivative Instruments). The interest rate hedge was terminated on July 31, 2024 in conjunction with the sale of the Fayetteville property. The valuation of this instrument was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivative. The analyses reflected the contractual terms of the derivative, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities as applicable. The fair value of the interest hedge was determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments. To comply with GAAP, we incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of derivative contract for the effect of non-performance risk, we considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. Although we had determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative was within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. However, through September 30, 2024, we had assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustment on the overall valuation of our derivative position and determined that the credit valuation adjustment was not significant to the overall valuation of our derivative. As a result, we determined that our derivatives valuation in its entirety was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class W shares. Organization and offering costs consisted of all expenses (other than sales commissions, dealer manager fees, stockholder servicing fees, and dealer manager servicing fees) paid by us in connection with the Public Offering, including our legal, accounting, printing, mailing and filing fees and other accountable organization and offering expenses, including, but not limited to, (i) amounts to reimburse our Advisor for all marketing related costs and expenses such as salaries and direct expenses of employees of our Advisor and its affiliates in connection with registering and marketing our shares; (ii) technology costs associated with the Public Offering; (iii) our costs of conducting our training and education meetings; (iv) our costs of attending retail seminars conducted by participating broker-dealers; and (v) payment or reimbursement of bona fide due diligence expenses. We also incurred similar organization and offering costs in connection with our Primary Private Offering. Pursuant to an Advisor Funding Agreement (the Advisor Funding Agreement ), our Advisor also agreed to fund, and not be reimbursed for, of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares. Our Advisor must reimburse us within days after the end of the month in which the Public Offering terminated to the extent organization and offering expenses incurred in good faith exceed the estimate being funded by the Advisor. Conversely, we must reimburse our Advisor within days after the end of the month in which the Public Offering terminates to the extent such organization and offering expenses are less than the estimate being funded by the Advisor pursuant to the Advisor Funding Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the suspension of our Primary Offering and termination of our Former Dealer Manager, we expected that the organization and offering expenses incurred on the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares would exceed at the termination of the Public Offering. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a receivable from our Advisor for organization and offering expenses incurred in excess of the limitation, which resulted in a million reduction in due to affiliates and an increase in additional paid in capital. Subsequent to the termination of our Public Offering on May 1, 2021, we determined no additional adjustment was required. Advisory Agreement We do not have any employees. Our Advisor is primarily responsible for managing our business affairs and carrying out the directives of our board of directors. Our Advisor receives various fees and expenses under the terms of our Advisory Agreement. As discussed above, we are required to reimburse our Advisor for certain organization and offering costs from the Offerings; provided, however, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, our Advisor funded, and was not reimbursed for, of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class W shares in the Primary Offering. The Advisory Agreement also requires our Advisor to reimburse us to the extent that offering expenses, including sales commissions, dealer manager fees, stockholder servicing fees and dealer manager servicing fees, are in excess of of gross proceeds from the Primary Offering. Prior to the amendment of the Advisory Agreement on September 6, 2018 (the AA Amendment ), our Advisor received acquisition fees equal to of the contract purchase price of each property we acquired. The AA Amendment eliminated such acquisition fees. On July 10, 2019, we entered into another amendment to the Advisory Agreement (the Second AA Amendment ). Pursuant to the Second AA Amendment, our Advisor may be entitled to an acquisition fee (the Contingent Acquisition Fee with respect to acquisitions made subsequent to July 10, 2019, subject to us satisfying certain stockholder return thresholds or if the Advisory Agreement is terminated for any reason other than our Advisor s fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence before July 10, 2029. After we pay stockholders total distributions equal to their invested capital, plus a cumulative, non-compounded annual return on invested capital, we will pay our Advisor a contingent acquisition fee equal to of the Contract Purchase Price (as defined in the Second AA Amendment) of each property or other real estate investment we acquire after July 10, 2019; and after we pay stockholders total distributions equal to their invested capital, plus a cumulative, non-compounded annual return on invested capital, we will pay our Advisor an additional contingent acquisition fee equal to of the Contract Purchase Price of each property or other real estate investment we acquire after July 10, 2019. Our Advisor also receives reimbursement of any acquisition expenses our Advisor incurs pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, effective May 1, 2018, our Advisor is entitled to receive a monthly asset management fee. This fee was initially equal to (which is of our average invested assets, as defined by the Advisory Agreement, but the AA Amendment later increased this fee to (which is of our average invested assets. Our Advisor will not receive financing fees pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.

 of the Contract Sales Price or (b) of the Competitive Real Estate Commission (as defined in the Second AA Amendment). In conjunction with the sale of the Tallahassee property in January 2022, a million disposition fee was paid to our Sponsor in accordance with the Second AA Amendment. On July 31, 2024, in conjunction with the sale of the Fayetteville property, a million disposition fee was paid to our Sponsor in accordance with the Second AA Amendment. Our Advisor may also be entitled to various subordinated distributions under our operating partnership agreement if we (1) list our shares of common stock on a national exchange, (2) do not renew or terminate the Advisory Agreement, (3) liquidate our portfolio or (4) effect a merger or other corporate reorganization. The Advisory Agreement provides for reimbursement of our Advisor s direct and indirect costs of providing administrative and management services to us. Beginning four fiscal quarters after commencement of the Public Offering, pursuant to our Advisory Agreement, our Advisor is required to pay or reimburse us the amount by which our aggregate annual operating expenses, as defined, exceed the greater of of our average invested assets or of our net income, as defined, unless a majority of our independent directors determine that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For any fiscal quarter for which total operating expenses for the months then ended exceed the limitation, we will disclose this fact in our next quarterly report or within days of the end of that quarter and send a written disclosure of this fact to our stockholders. In each case the disclosure will include an explanation of the factors that the independent directors considered in arriving at the conclusion that the excess expenses were justified. As of September 30, 2024, our aggregate annual operating expenses, as defined, did not exceed the thresholds described above. Advisor Funding Agreement Concurrent with the execution of the Second AA Amendment (as described above), we entered into the Advisor Funding Agreement by and among us, our Operating Partnership, our Advisor and our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Advisor agreed to fund the payment of the upfront sales commission for the sale of Class Y shares, the upfront dealer manager fee for the sale of Class Y shares, and the estimated organization and offering expenses for the sale of the Class Y shares and Class Z shares in the Primary Offering. Our Advisor s obligation to fund the upfront sales commissions, upfront dealer manager fees, and organization and offering expenses was expressly limited to us raising million in gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class Y shares pursuant to the Primary Offering. Our Advisor may terminate the Advisor Funding Agreement at any time in its sole discretion after we have raised million in gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class Y shares pursuant to the Primary Offering. At the termination of the Primary Offering, our Advisor was required to reimburse us within days after the end of the month in which the Primary Offering terminated if the organization and offering expenses exceed the estimate being funded by our Advisor pursuant to the Advisor Funding Agreement. Conversely, we were required to reimburse our Advisor within days after the end of the month in which the Primary Offering terminated to the extent the organization and offering expenses were less than the estimate being funded by our Advisor pursuant to the Advisor Funding Agreement. As of March 31, 2020, prior to the suspension of our Primary Offering, we raised approximately million in gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class Y shares and Z shares, and received funding from our Advisor of approximately million for the payment of sales commissions and dealer manager fees for the sale of Class Y shares, and organization and offering expenses for the sale of Class Y shares and Z shares. Subsequent to March 31, 2020, no sales have been made pursuant to the Primary Offering. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the suspension of our Primary Offering and termination of our Former Dealer Manager, we expected that the organization and offering expenses incurred on the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares would exceed at the termination of the Public Offering. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a receivable from our Advisor for organization and offering expenses incurred in excess of the limitation, which resulted in a million reduction in due to affiliates and an increase in additional paid in capital. Subsequent to the termination of our Public Offering on May 1, 2021, we determined no additional adjustment was required. Dealer Manager Agreement In connection with our Public Offering, our Former Dealer Manager received a sales commission of up to of gross proceeds from sales of Class A shares and up to of gross proceeds from the sales of Class T shares in the Primary Offering and a dealer manager fee of up to of gross proceeds from sales of both Class A shares and Class T shares in the Primary Offering under the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement. Our Former Dealer Manager did not receive an upfront sales commission or dealer manager fee from sales of Class W shares in the Primary Offering. As of June 21, 2019, we ceased offering Class A shares, Class T shares and Class W shares in our Primary Offering, and on July 10, 2019, we commenced offering Class Y shares and Class Z shares. On March 30, 2020, our board of directors 

 29 

STRATEGIC STUDENT SENIOR HOUSING TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (Unaudited) 

 , our Public Offering terminated. On April 17, 2020, in accordance with provisions of the Dealer Manager Agreement, we provided a -day termination notice to our Former Dealer Manager and p ursuant to such notice, the Dealer Manager Agreement was terminated on . Pursuant to the Dealer Manager Agreement, we paid our Former Dealer Manager upfront sales commissions in the amount of of the gross proceeds of the Class Y shares sold and dealer manager fees in the amount of of the gross proceeds of the Class Y shares sold in the primary portion of the offering. However, as described above, our Advisor agreed to fund the payment of all upfront sales commissions and dealer manager fees on Class Y shares sold, subject to certain limitations. In addition, our Former Dealer Manager received an ongoing stockholder servicing fee that was payable monthly and of the Class T shares and Class Y shares sold in the Primary Offering, subject to certain limitations described below. Our Former Dealer Manager received an ongoing dealer manager servicing fee that was payable monthly and of the Class W shares and Class Z shares sold in the Primary Offering. The Dealer Manager Agreement provided that we would cease paying the stockholder servicing fee with respect to the Class T shares and Class Y shares sold in the Primary Offering at the earlier of (i) the date we list our shares on a national securities exchange, merge or consolidate with or into another entity, or sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (ii) the date at which the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources equals of the gross proceeds from the sale of Class A shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares, and Class Z shares in our Primary Offering (i.e., excluding proceeds from sales pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan), which calculation shall be made commencing after the termination of our Primary Offering; (iii) with respect to a particular Class T share and Class Y share, the third anniversary of the issuance of the share; and (iv) the date that such Class T share or Class Y share is redeemed or is no longer outstanding. The Dealer Manager Agreement provided that we would cease paying the dealer manager servicing fee with respect to the Class W shares and Class Z shares sold in the Primary Offering at the earlier of (i) the date we list our shares on a national securities exchange, merge or consolidate with or into another entity, or sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (ii) the date at which the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources equals of the gross proceeds from the sale of Class A shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares, and Class Z shares in our Primary Offering (i.e., excluding proceeds from sales pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan), which calculation shall be made commencing after the termination of our Primary Offering; (iii) the end of the month in which the aggregate dealer manager servicing fees paid in our Primary Offering with respect to Class W shares or Class Z shares equals of the gross proceeds from the sale of Class W shares or Class Z shares, respectively, in our Primary Offering (i.e., excluding proceeds from sales pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan), which calculation shall be made commencing after the termination of our Primary Offering, and (iv) the date that such Class W share or Class Z share is redeemed or is no longer outstanding. As a result of the suspension of our Primary Offering and termination of our Former Dealer Manager, we expected that the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources would exceed at the termination of the Public Offering. Accordingly, we ceased paying stockholder servicing fees and dealer manager servicing fees in April 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we have t recorded a liability for the future payment of the stockholder servicing fees and dealer manager servicing fees. In connection with our Public Offering, our Former Dealer Manager entered into participating dealer agreements with certain other broker-dealers which authorized them to sell our shares. Upon sale of our shares by such broker-dealers, our Former Dealer Manager allowed all of the sales commissions paid in connection with sales made by these broker-dealers. Our Former Dealer Manager was also permitted to allow these broker-dealers a portion of their dealer manager fee as marketing fees, reimbursement of certain costs and expenses of attending training and education meetings sponsored by our Former Dealer Manager, payment of attendance fees required for employees of our Former Dealer Manager or other affiliates to attend retail seminars and public seminars sponsored by these broker-dealers, or to defray other distribution-related expenses. Our Former Dealer Manager also received reimbursement of bona fide due diligence expenses; however, to the extent these due diligence expenses cannot be justified, any excess over actual due diligence expenses will be considered underwriting compensation subject to a FINRA limitation and, when aggregated with all other non-accountable expenses in connection with our Public Offering, may not exceed 3 of gross offering proceeds from sales in the Public Offering.

 non-voting equity interest in our Former Dealer Manager. Affiliates of our Former Dealer Manager own a non-voting membership interest in our Advisor, which they acquired on January 1, 2018. Transfer Agent Agreement Our Sponsor is the owner and manager of our Transfer Agent, which is a registered transfer agent with the SEC. Effective in May 2018, our Transfer Agent processes subscription agreements and certain other forms directly, as well as provides customer service to our stockholders. These services include, among other things, processing payment of any sales commission and dealer manager fees associated with a particular purchase, as well as processing the distributions and any servicing fees with respect to our shares. Additionally, our Transfer Agent may retain and supervise third party vendors in its efforts to administer certain services. Our Transfer Agent also conducts transfer agent and registrar services for other non-traded REITs sponsored by an affiliate of our Sponsor. Fees paid to our Transfer Agent are based on a fixed quarterly fee, one-time account setup fees, monthly open account fees, one time transfer fees, monthly portal fees, and investor telephone call fees. In addition, we will reimburse our Transfer Agent for all reasonable expenses or other changes incurred by it in connection with the provision of its services to us, and we will pay our Transfer Agent fees for any additional services we may request from time to time, in accordance with its rates then in effect. Upon the request of our Transfer Agent, we may also advance payment for substantial reasonable out-of-pocket expenditures to be incurred by it. The initial term of the Transfer Agent Agreement was three years, which term will be automatically renewed for one year successive terms, but either party may terminate the Transfer Agent Agreement upon 90 days prior written notice. In the event that we terminate the Transfer Agent Agreement, other than for cause, we will pay our Transfer Agent all amounts that would have otherwise accrued during the remaining term of the Transfer Agent Agreement; provided, however, that when calculating the remaining months in the term for such purposes, such term is deemed to be a 12-month period starting from the date of the most recent annual anniversary date. Property Managers Pursuant to our Advisory Agreement, our Advisor is responsible for overseeing any third party property managers or operators and may delegate such responsibility to its affiliates. Our Advisor has assigned such oversight responsibilities to our Property Manager. Currently, we expect to rely on third party property managers and senior living operators to manage and operate our properties. of the gross revenues attributable to such properties; provided, however, that our Property Manager will receive an oversight fee equal to of the gross revenues attributable to any senior housing property other than such properties that are leased to third party tenants under triple-net or similar lease structures. In the event any of our properties are managed directly by our Property Manager, we will pay our Property Manager a property management fee that is approved by a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors not otherwise interested in such transaction, as being fair and reasonable to us and on terms and conditions not less favorable to us than those available from unaffiliated third parties.

Distribution Reinvestment Plans We adopted a distribution reinvestment plan in connection with the Private Offering (the Private Offering Distribution Reinvestment Plan that allowed our stockholders to have distributions otherwise distributable to them invested in additional shares of our common stock. On May 1, 2018, we amended and restated the Private Offering Distribution Reinvestment Plan in connection with the Public Offering to establish the purchase price per share under the distribution reinvestment plan of our Class A, Class T, and Class W shares. On June 21, 2019, our board of directors further amended and restated the distribution reinvestment plan (the Distribution Reinvestment Plan ), effective as of July 13, 2019, to include, as eligible participants, stockholders holding Class Y shares of our common stock and stockholders holding Class Z shares of our

 per share for all classes of shares. sales commissions or dealer manager fees are paid with respect to the sale of such shares. On September 28, 2020, our board of directors further amended the Distribution Reinvestment Plan, effective as of October 10, 2020, to state that the purchase price for shares pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan shall be equal to the estimated value per share of each class of shares. We may amend or terminate the Distribution Reinvestment Plan for any reason at any time upon days prior written notice to stockholders. On March 30, 2020, our board of directors approved the suspension of our distributions; and during such suspension, distributions will be reinvested pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan. Share Redemption Program We adopted a Share Redemption Program that enables stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. As long as our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or over-the-counter market, our stockholders who have held their stock for at least may be able to have all or any portion of their shares of stock redeemed by us. We may redeem the shares of stock presented for redemption for cash to the extent that we have sufficient funds available to fund such redemption. Our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the Share Redemption Program with 30 days notice to our stockholders. We may provide this notice by including such information in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC, or by a separate mailing to our stockholders. In order to preserve cash in light of the uncertainty relating to COVID-19 and its potential impact on our overall financial results, on March 30, 2020, our board of directors approved the suspension of our Share Redemption Program, effective May 3, 2020. Our share redemption program remains suspended as of September 30, 2024. As a result of our board of directors approving an estimated net asset value per share on January 22, 2024, the per share price for the repurchase of a given class of shares is equal to the then-current estimated net asset value per share for such class of shares; however, as noted elsewhere our Share Redemption Program is currently suspended. If we recommence our Share Redemption Program, there will be several limitations on our ability to redeem shares under the Share Redemption Program including, but not limited to: Unless the shares are being redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability (as defined under the Share Redemption Program) or bankruptcy, we may not redeem shares until the stockholder has held his or her shares for one year. 

 During any calendar year, we will not redeem in excess of of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. 

 The cash available for redemption is limited to the proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. 

 We have obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland law, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency. 

 For the year ended December 31, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did t receive any redemption requests.

ITEM 2. 	 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report, as well as with our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements preceding Part I. 
 Overview 
 Strategic Student Senior Housing Trust, Inc. was formed on October 4, 2016 and commenced formal operations on June 28, 2017, as discussed below. We were formed under the MGCL for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in student housing and senior housing properties and related real estate investments. We elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017.
 
 On January 27, 2017, pursuant to a confidential private placement memorandum, we commenced a private offering of up to 100,000,000 in shares of our common stock (the Primary Private Offering and 1,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (together with the Primary Private Offering, the Private Offering ). The Private Offering required a minimum offering amount of 1,000,000, which we met on August 4, 2017. Our Private Offering terminated on March 15, 2018. We raised offering proceeds of approximately 91.5 million from the issuance of approximately 10.7 million shares pursuant to the Private Offering. Please see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information. Upon the commencement of our Public Offering, discussed below, and the filing of the articles of amendment to our charter, all outstanding common stock was redesignated as Class A common stock.
 
 On May 1, 2018, we commenced a public offering of a maximum of 1.0 billion in common shares for sale to the public (the Primary Offering and 95.0 million in common shares for sale pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (together with the Primary Offering, the Public Offering, and collectively with the Private Offering, the Offerings ), consisting of three classes of shares: Class A shares for 10.33 per share (up to 450 million in shares), Class T shares for 10.00 per share (up to 450 million in shares), and Class W shares for 9.40 per share (up to 100 million in shares).
 
 On June 21, 2019, we suspended the sale of Class A shares, Class T shares, and Class W shares in the Primary Offering and filed a post-effective amendment to our Registration Statement to register two new classes of common stock (Class Y shares and Class Z shares) with the SEC. On July 10, 2019, the post-effective amendment to our Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC. Also on July 10, 2019, we filed articles supplementary to our charter which reclassified certain authorized and unissued shares of our common stock into Class Y shares and Class Z shares. Effective July 10, 2019, we began offering Class Y shares (up to 700 million in shares) and Class Z shares (up to 300 million in shares) in our Primary Offering at a price of 9.30 per share and are offering Class A shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares, and Class Z shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan at a price of 9.30 per share. The termination of our Primary Offering occurred on May 1, 2021.
 
 On March 30, 2020, our board of directors approved the suspension of the Primary Offering based upon various factors, including the uncertainty relating to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on us and our overall financial results. Our board of directors also approved the suspension of our share redemption program (see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies for additional detail) and the suspension of distributions to our stockholders. Primarily as a result of the suspension and subsequent termination of our Public Offering, we currently do not have the equity capital needed to acquire additional properties and, consequently, we are focusing our efforts on managing our existing properties.
 
 Subsequent to March 31, 2020, no sales were made pursuant to the Primary Offering. As of September 30, 2024, we had sold approximately 362,000 Class A shares, approximately 70,000 Class T shares, approximately 83,000 Class W shares, approximately 1.1 million Class Y shares, and approximately 165,000 Class Z shares for gross offering proceeds of approximately 17.1 million in our Primary Offering.
 
 35 

On January 22, 2024, our board of directors, upon recommendation of our nominating and corporate governance committee, approved an estimated value per share of 6.34 for our Class A shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares, and Class Z shares based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the number of shares outstanding on an adjusted fully diluted basis, calculated as of September 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024 we owned four senior housing properties.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have established accounting policies which conform to generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the U.S. Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Following is a discussion of the estimates and assumptions used in setting accounting policies that we consider critical in the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of GAAP may have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance, or on the comparability of such information to amounts reported for other periods, because of the subjectivity and judgment required to account for highly uncertain items or the susceptibility of such items to change. These estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and our reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods covered by this report. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses would have been recorded, thus resulting in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may use different estimates and assumptions that may impact the comparability of our financial condition and results of operations to those companies. 
 We believe that our critical accounting policies include the following: real estate purchase price allocations; the evaluation of whether any of our long-lived assets have been impaired; the determination of the useful lives of our long-lived assets; and the evaluation of the consolidation of our interests in joint ventures. The following discussion of these policies supplements, but does not supplant the description of our significant accounting policies, as contained in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report, and is intended to present our analysis of the uncertainties involved in arriving upon and applying each policy. 
 36 

Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation 
 We account for acquisitions in accordance with GAAP which requires that we allocate the purchase price of a property to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. This guidance requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, which requires the use of significant unobservable inputs as of the acquisition date. 
 The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. Because we believe that substantially all of the leases in place at properties we will acquire will be at market rates, as the majority of the leases are one year or less, we do not expect to allocate any portion of the purchase prices to above or below market leases. Acquisitions of portfolios of properties are allocated to the individual properties based upon an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual property along with current and projected occupancy and rental rate levels or appraised values, if available. 
 Our allocations of purchase prices are based on certain significant estimates and assumptions, variations in such estimates and assumptions could result in a materially different presentation of the consolidated financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The majority of our assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and other assets consist of long-lived real estate assets as well as intangible assets related to our acquisitions. We will evaluate such assets for impairment based on events and changes in circumstances that may arise in the future and that may impact the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets. When indicators of potential impairment are present, we will assess the recoverability of the particular asset by determining whether the carrying value of the asset will be recovered, through an evaluation of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. This evaluation is based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Based on this evaluation, if the expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we will adjust the value of the long-lived asset and recognize an impairment loss. Our evaluation of the impairment of long-lived assets could result in a materially different presentation of the consolidated financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the consolidated financial statements, as the amount of impairment loss recognized, if any, may vary based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets 
 We assess the useful lives of the assets underlying our properties based upon a subjective determination of the period of future benefit for each asset. We record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon the estimated useful lives we determine. Our determinations of the useful lives of the assets could result in a materially different presentation of the consolidated financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the consolidated financial statements, as such determinations, and the corresponding amount of depreciation expense, may vary dramatically based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 Consolidation of Investments in Joint Ventures 
 We evaluate the consolidation of our investments in joint ventures in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. This evaluation requires us to determine whether we have a controlling interest in a joint venture through a means other than voting rights, and, if so, such joint venture may be required to be consolidated in our financial statements. Our evaluation of our joint ventures under such accounting guidance could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the consolidated financial statements, as the joint venture entities included in our consolidated financial statements may vary based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 REIT Qualification 
 We made an election to be taxed as a REIT, under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to currently distribute at least 90 of the REIT s ordinary taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT and intend to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner that we will remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have derived revenues from our continuing operations principally from rents and related fees received from residents of our senior housing properties and to a lesser extent from other services provided at our senior housing properties. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have derived revenues from our discontinued operations principally from rents and related fees received from residents of our student housing property. Our operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing residents and lease our available units to new residents, while maintaining and, where possible, increasing rates. Additionally, our operating results depend on our residents making their required payments to us. 
 Competition in the markets in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental revenues, fees and operating expenses of our student housing and senior housing properties. Development of any new student housing or senior housing properties would intensify competition in the markets in which we operate and could negatively impact our results. 
 Recent Market Conditions 
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic caused state and local governments to institute quarantines, shelter in place rules and restrictions on travel, the types of business that were allowed to continue to operate, and the types of construction projects that were allowed to continue. We have implemented precautionary and protective measures intended to help ensure the well-being of our residents and staff at our student and senior housing properties. The Public Health Emergency expired in May 2023 and we expect the adverse effect the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our financial condition and results of operations to continue to mitigate. We expect revenues and expenses to continue to fluctuate, as we remain cognizant of the current economic risk factors, including interest rate fluctuations, that could negatively impact the financial performance of our portfolio in future periods.
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, occupancy at our Fayetteville property was approximately 99 . Due to increased enrollment over the last two years coupled with minimal new development in Fayetteville, we experienced more favorable supply and demand conditions, which allowed us to increase rental rates. On July 31, 2024, we sold the Fayetteville property for 72.25 million, less closing costs. 
 At our senior housing properties, during 2023 and 2024 we continue to see, COVID-19 variant breakthrough infections, however, we have experienced increased move in activity and occupancies while continuing to incur incremental, COVID-19 related expenses. During 2023 and 2024, historically low unemployment and competitors, have negatively affected the ability of our senior housing properties to maintain necessary staffing levels resulting in the need to use third party contract services and overtime.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 A comparison of our cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is as follows: 

Nine Months Ended

Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 4.7) million and 1.4 million, respectively, a change of approximately 6.1) million. The increase in cash (used in) operating activities was primarily the result of a decrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities due to the sale of the Fayetteville property in July 2024. 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 69.9 million and 2.4) million, respectively, a change of approximately 72.3 million. The increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily the result of the net proceeds from the sale of the Fayetteville property in July 2024. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 56.9 million and 1.7 million, respectively, a change of approximately 55.2 million. The increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily the result of the repayment of the 34.5 million Fayetteville Mortgage Loan and the 25.4 million KeyBank Bridge Loans in conjunction with the sale of the Fayetteville property in July 2024. 
 Short-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity needs consist primarily of our property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, regularly scheduled debt service payments, and capital expenditures. Currently, we generally expect that we will meet our 
 41 

short-term operating liquidity requirements from the combination of our cash on hand, proceeds from net cash provided by property operations, proceeds from secured or unsecured financing from banks or other lenders, issuance of preferred units in our Operating Partnership, and advances from our Advisor, which will be repaid, without interest, as funds are available after meeting our current liquidity requirements, subject to the limitations on reimbursement set forth in our Advisory Agreement. 
 We believe we have access to adequate resources to meet the needs of our existing operations, mandatory capital expenditures, and working capital, to the extent not funded by cash provided by operating activities. However, volatility in the debt and equity markets and continued and/or further impact of COVID-19, inflation and other economic events will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. While we do not expect such events to have a material impact upon our liquidity in the short-term, continued uncertainty or deterioration in the debt and equity markets over an extended period of time could potentially impact our liquidity over the long-term. 
 Distribution Policy and Distributions 
 In order to retain cash and preserve financial flexibility in light of the impact that COVID-19 has had and could continue to have on our business and the uncertainty as to the ultimate severity, duration, and effects of the outbreak, on March 30, 2020, our board of directors approved the suspension of all distributions to our stockholders. 
 Historically, we have made distributions to our stockholders using a combination of cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the Public Offering in anticipation of additional future cash flow. As such, this reduces the amount of capital we ultimately invested in properties. Because substantially all of our operations are performed indirectly through our Operating Partnership, our ability to pay distributions depends in large part on our Operating Partnership s ability to pay distributions to its partners, including to us. In the event we do not have enough cash from operations to fund cash distributions, we may borrow, issue additional securities or sell assets in order to fund. Though we have previously only paid cash distributions and may pay stock distributions in the future, we are authorized by our charter to pay in-kind distributions of readily marketable securities, distributions of beneficial interests in a liquidating trust established for our dissolution and the liquidation of our assets in accordance with the terms of the charter or distributions that meet all of the following conditions: (a) our board of directors advises each stockholder of the risks associated with direct ownership of the property; (b) our board of directors offers each stockholder the election of receiving such in-kind distributions; and (c) in-kind distributions are only made to those stockholders who accept such offer. 
 Distributions are paid to our stockholders based on the record date selected by our board of directors. Prior to the suspension of our distributions, we paid distributions monthly based on daily declaration and record dates so that investors may be entitled to distributions immediately upon purchasing our shares. Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors, which are directed, in substantial part, by its obligation to cause us to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code. Our board of directors may increase, decrease or eliminate the distribution rate that is being paid at any time. Distributions are made on all classes of our common stock at the same time. The per share amount of distributions on different classes of shares will likely differ because of different allocations of class-specific expenses. Specifically, distributions on Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares, and Class Z shares will likely be lower than distributions on Class A shares because Class T shares and Class Y shares are subject to ongoing stockholder servicing fees and Class W shares and Class Z shares are subject to ongoing dealer manager servicing fees. The funds we receive from operations that are available for distribution may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: 
 our operating and interest expenses; 

the amount of distributions or dividends received by us from our indirect real estate investments; 

our ability to keep our properties occupied; 

our ability to maintain or increase rental rates; 

the performance of any lease-up, development and redevelopment properties we may acquire; 

any significant delays in construction for development or redevelopment properties we may acquire; 

construction defects or capital improvements; and 

capital expenditures and reserves for such expenditures. 

42 

We commenced paying distributions in September 2017. From our inception through September 30, 2024, we paid cumulative distributions of approximately 17.3 million, including approximately 0.2 million related to our preferred unitholders, as compared to cumulative net loss attributable to our common stockholders of approximately 60.6 million, which includes acquisition related expenses of approximately 3.4 million and non-cash depreciation and amortization of approximately 75.7 million. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not declare or pay any distributions and had a net gain attributable to our common stockholders of approximately 25.4 million and 19.5 million, respectively. In connection with the sale of the Fayetteville Property we anticipate making a distribution to stockholders for tax year 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not declare or pay any distributions and had a net loss attributable to our common stockholders of approximately 2.8 million and 8.4 million, respectively. 
 We must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year in order to meet the requirements for being treated as a REIT under the Code. Our directors may authorize distributions in excess of this percentage as they deem appropriate. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions may not reflect our income earned in that particular distribution period, but may be made in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period and may be made in advance of actual receipt of funds in an attempt to make distributions relatively uniform. To allow for such differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses, and the effect of required debt payments, among other things, we could be required to borrow funds from third parties on a short-term basis, issue new securities, or sell assets to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We are not prohibited from undertaking such activities by our charter, bylaws or investment policies, and we may use an unlimited amount from any source to pay our distributions. These methods of obtaining funding could affect future distributions by increasing operating costs and decreasing available cash, which could reduce the value of our stockholders investment in our shares. In addition, such distributions may constitute a return of investors capital. In the future, we may decide to make stock distributions or to make distributions using a combination of stock and cash in order to meet the REIT distribution requirements under the Code or otherwise. 
 We have not been able to, and may not be able to, pay distributions, solely from our cash flows from operations, in which case distributions may be paid in part from debt financing. The payment of distributions from sources other than cash flows from operations may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
 Indebtedness 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness was approximately 105.1 million in fixed rate debt. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our indebtedness. 
 Long-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the payment of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, if resumed in the future, and for property capital improvements, and acquisitions, either directly or through entity interests, if any. 
 Long-term potential future sources of capital include secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, issuance of equity securities including private offerings, undistributed funds from operations, and potential sales of remaining properties. To the extent we are not able to secure requisite financing in the form of a credit facility or other debt, we will be dependent upon proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, cash flows from operating activities and potential sales of remaining properties in order to meet our long-term liquidity requirements and to fund our distributions, if any.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities are often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. 
 ITEM 3. 	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk. We may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and fund acquisition, expansion, and financing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt consisted of approximately 105.1 million in fixed rate debt. Our debt instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes. A change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts its fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows.

ITEM 4. 	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. 	 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 None. 
 ITEM 1A. 	 RIS K FACTORS 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We have incurred net income to date and have an accumulated deficit. 
 We incurred net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately 19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our accumulated deficit was approximately 60.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Given that (i) we are in our operational stage and (ii) due to COVID-19 we terminated our Public Offering, we currently have no plans to acquire any additional properties. 
 Our real estate investments are concentrated in senior housing properties, and we may be negatively impacted by adverse trends in the senior housing industry. 
 As of July 31, 2024, we owned four senior housing properties. On July 31, 2024, we sold the Fayetteville property for 72.25 million. The disposal of the Fayetteville property represents a strategic shift in our business as we will no longer own or operate student housing communities and no longer diversify our investments by multiple asset classes. We are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and, in particular, senior housing properties. Therefore, a negative impact on the economy or the senior housing industry in which our properties and businesses operate, could particularly negatively affect our operation and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 ITEM 2. 	 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUIT Y SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 (a) None. 

(b) Not applicable. 

(c) Our share redemption program enables our stockholders to have their shares redeemed by us, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described in our prospectus and publicly filed documents. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not redeem any shares. 

ITEM 3. 	 DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
