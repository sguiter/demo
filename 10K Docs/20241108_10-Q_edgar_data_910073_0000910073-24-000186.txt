PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Background 
 
 Flagstar Financial, Inc. is a bank holding company (collectively with its subsidiaries the Company whose principal operation is its subsidiary Flagstar Bank, N.A. (the Bank ). The Company has experienced a number of events in the last 22 months that have significantly impacted its balance sheet, results of operations, credit losses, liquidity and funding, and regulatory capital. At the end of 2022, the Company acquired and merged with Flagstar Bancorp Inc. ("Flagstar Bancorp") which increased assets by 26 billion and liabilities by 24 billion. In March 2023 the Company acquired 38 billion of assets and assumed 36 billion of liabilities from the FDIC related to the former Signature Bridge Bank. These transactions resulted in the Company exceeding 100 billion in total assets which results in being categorized as a Category IV institution for regulatory purposes, increasing requirements and expectations related to liquidity, risk management and governance. Refer to Regulatory Capital and Requirements of Category IV Standards for additional information. Effective October 25, 2024 the Company s name changed to Flagstar Financial, Inc. from New York Community Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Beginning in late 2023, the Company s loan portfolio began to experience stress, related principally to vacancy-driven declines in the office sector, and inflation and high interest rates in the multi-family sector, particularly for the sub-set of the Company s loan portfolio comprised of majority rent-regulated collateral, a portion of which is impacted by a 2019 New York State law change. Concerns about the impact of these portfolio stresses led to significant declines in the Company s stock price and customer deposit withdrawals in the first quarter 2024. In response to these declines, the Company raised 1.05 billion in equity capital in March 2024 through the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock and preferred stock convertible to common stock, and raised liquidity through brokered deposits and wholesale funding. The result of these events and conditions has led to a significantly lower net interest margin and higher loan loss provisions in 2024. Subsequent to the March 2024 capital raise, the Company s customer deposit base stabilized, and grew substantially in the second and third quarters of 2024 as a result of private banking customers returning deposits to the Bank and through promotional programs for retail customers. 
 
 To further simplify the Company s operations, reduce operational risk, and begin transitioning to a more diversified regional bank, as well as enhance its regulatory capital ratios and liquidity, in the third quarter 2024 the (i) Company completed the sale of its warehouse lending portfolio (approximately 6 billion in assets) and (ii) entered into a definitive agreement to sell its mortgage servicing, subservicing and third-party origination activities, which sale was completed on October 31, 2024. The warehouse lending sale provided significant increased liquidity, which allowed us to repay wholesale borrowings late in the third quarter of 2024. It also increased the Company's capital ratios approximately 70 basis points. We estimate the mortgage sale transaction will further increase the Company s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio by approximately 60 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company expects to incur impairment and severance charges during the fourth quarter 2024 related to the sale. These transactions will decrease interest income and fee income until the resulting capital has been redeployed by the Company in lending and investing activities. These decreases will be partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with the activities being sold. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 The Company reported a third quarter 2024 net loss of 280 million compared to a net loss of 323 million for the second quarter 2024. The net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter 2024 was 289 million, or 0.79 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of 333 million, or 1.14 per diluted share for the second quarter 2024. Included in the third quarter 2024 results are 37 million of merger-related expenses and certain items related to the sale of the mortgage warehouse business in July 2024, which aggregates to 0.10 per diluted share. Included in the second quarter 2024 results are 25 million of merger-related expenses or 0.09 per diluted share. 
 
 6 

During the first nine months of 2024, the Company reported a net loss of 930 million compared to net income of 2.6 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2024 was 957 million or 3.16 per diluted share compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of 2.6 billion for the first nine months of 2023 or 10.84 per diluted share. Included in the results for the first nine months of 2024 are a 121 million reduction in the bargain purchase gain arising from the Signature transaction, 94 million of merger-related expenses, and certain items related to the sale of the mortgage warehouse business in July 2024, which aggregate to 0.71 per diluted share. Included in the results for the first nine months of 2023 are a bargain purchase gain of 2.1 billion arising from the Signature transaction and 198 million of merger-related expenses, which aggregate to 8.10 per diluted share. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income is our primary source of income. The amount of our net interest income is a function of the amount of interest-earning assets we hold, the manner in which we fund these assets, including interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the interest rates we earn on assets and the interest rates we pay on liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by various external factors, including the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee, and market interest rates. 
 
 Our interest-bearing liabilities are comprised of customer deposits and funds we borrow. The average term of our fixed rate deposits is less than twelve months, therefore the cost of our deposits and most of our borrowed funds is largely based on short-term rates of interest, the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee. The yields on our held-for-investment loans, and the majority of our cash balances, reset based on short-term market rates. However, a sizable portion of our held-for-investment loans have fixed rates and generally reset to intermediate-term market rates when they reach repricing dates.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our net interest income and average balance sheet for the periods indicated. Average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances for the periods are derived from average balances that are calculated daily.

 Comparison to Prior Quarter 
 
 The net interest margin for the third quarter 2024 was 1.79 percent, down 19 basis points compared to the second quarter 2024 and down 148 basis points compared to the third quarter 2023. The 19 basis points reduction compared to the second quarter 2024 was the result of a 22 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to 4.37 percent. This is coupled with continued deposit growth of 4.0 billion, or a 7 percent increase, in average interest-bearing deposits to 63.6 billion. Additionally, we carried higher cash balances from the sale of the warehouse portfolio prior to paying down debt at the end of the quarter. The average cost of borrowed funds remained unchanged at 5.28 percent. 
 
 A substantial portion of our commercial real estate loan portfolio has a fixed rate through the repricing date, which can extend several years. Because most of these loans were originated when market rates were lower than present rates, they have a negative impact to our net interest margin. However, upon reaching repricing option dates, the resulting rate resets will increase our interest income if higher interest rates persist. See "Loan Maturity and Repricing" below. Other factors affecting the amount of our net interest income for the third quarter 2024 include a 0.6 billion increase in nonaccrual loans and the associated reversal of previously accrued interest income on those loans. 
 
 Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the net interest margin was 2.01 percent, down 104 basis points compared to the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily from the impact of customer deposit withdrawals in the first quarter 2024 and the resulting shift in deposit mix to the promotional high-yield savings product, short-term certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings. 
 
 Other factors affecting net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 include: 
 
 A 2.3 billion increase in nonaccrual loans and the associated reversal of previously accrued interest income on those loans. 
 
 10 

A 9.4 billion increase in cash and investment securities driven by our actions to increase on-balance sheet liquidity and the sale of our warehouse portfolio in July 2024. 
 
 An increase in the average loan yield primarily due to the impact of multi-family loans repricing to higher rates upon reaching the end of their initial fixed rate periods. 
 
 A 48 basis point increase in the average yield on investment securities driven by lower rate securities maturing and being replaced with higher rate securities, consistent with the increase in market interest rates. 

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 Comparison to Prior Quarter 
 
 For the third quarter 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled 242 million compared to a 390 million provision for the second quarter 2024. The provision reflects lower charge-offs for the third quarter 2024, principally as a result of fewer larger-balance office property downgrades and charge-offs as a large portion of that portfolio was reviewed in the first and second quarters of 2024. The Company s multi-family portfolio continues to be impacted by market conditions as higher interest rates and inflationary impacts of the previous two years persist. The Company expects continued elevated charge-offs as additional loans near their re-pricing dates and appraisals are received on those properties. 
 
 Net charge-offs totaled 240 million for third quarter 2024, compared to 349 million for second quarter 2024. Net charge-offs on a non-annualized basis represented 0.31 percent of average loans outstanding during the third quarter 2024 compared to 0.42 percent of average loans outstanding during the second quarter 2024. Included in the third quarter net charge-offs was approximately 45 million of charge-offs taken on non-accrual loans that were moved to held for sale at the agreed-upon selling price. 
 
 Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled 947 million compared to a 281 million provision for the first nine months of 2023. The provision reflects substantial increases in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and charge-offs during the current period, principally related to risk rating downgrades on commercial real estate and multi-family loans with upcoming maturities or repricing for which the estimated property net operating income would not be sufficient to fully cover pro-forma debt service when applying current market rates and terms, as well as underlying collateral value declines principally in the office portfolio. 
 
 Net charge-offs totaled 670 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 23 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by an increase in nonaccrual loans in the commercial real estate and multi-family portfolios and underlying collateral value declines.

Non-Interest Income 
 
 The following table summarizes our non-interest income for the respective periods:

 (8) (5) 3 65 Other 30 29 88 46 Bargain purchase gain (121) 2,142 Total non-interest income 113 114 236 2,560 
 
 Comparison to Prior Quarter 
 
 In the third quarter 2024, non-interest income totaled 113 million compared to 114 million in the second quarter 2024. Net gain on loan sales and securitizations declined 13 million, driven by 23 million in selling costs related to the sale of the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio. This was offset by a 15 million increase in the net return on mortgage servicing rights. The slightly higher loss on net loan administration was due to higher interest paid on subservicing custodial deposits. 
 
 As a result of the Company s October 31, 2024 sale of its mortgage servicing, subservicing and third-party origination activities, substantially all income associated with servicing rights, gain on loan sales, and loan administration income ceased upon the transaction close. 
 
 Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, non-interest income totaled 236 million compared to 2.6 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Excluding the impact due to the bargain purchase gain related to the Signature transaction, noninterest income decreased 61 million. Net loan administration income totaled 3 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 65 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in subservicing income from short-term services provided as a result of the Signature transaction. Net gain on loan sales and securitizations declined 30 million driven by 23 million of selling costs related to the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio in 2024. Other noninterest income increased 42 million driven by higher commercial loan and investment product fee income, which was partially offset by a 16 million reduction in fee income driven by lower retail deposit transaction fees.

Non-Interest Expense 
 
 The following table summarizes our non-interest expense for the respective periods: 
 
 Three Months Ended, Nine Months Ended, (in millions) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 316 312 961 854 FDIC insurance 98 91 239 56 Occupancy and equipment 59 52 163 142 General and administrative 188 183 557 440 Total operating expense 661 638 1,920 1,492 Intangible asset amortization 37 33 105 90 Merger-related and restructuring expenses 18 34 95 267 Total non-interest expense 716 705 2,120 1,849 
 
 Comparison to Prior Quarter 
 
 Total non-interest expenses were 716 million, up 11 million or 2 percent compared to the second quarter 2024. The increase was driven primarily by a 7 million or 8 percent increase in FDIC insurance expense due to an increase in the amount of criticized and classified loans and other factors affecting the assessment rate. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2024, we have taken actions to reduce operating expenses through headcount and other cost reductions. While we expect our costs related to improvements in our risk infrastructure and expansion of commercial banking business will increase, we currently expect our overall level of non-interest expense to decrease in 2025. 
 
 Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
 
 Total non-interest expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were 2.1 billion, up 271 million or 15 percent compared to the first nine months of 2023. This increase was driven primarily by a 183 million increase in FDIC insurance expense due to an increase in the amount of criticized and classified loans, sequential four-quarter loss position and other factors affecting the assessment rate. The nine month period ended September 30, 2024 also includes the full impact of the Signature transaction that closed in March 2023, including an increase in the number of employees, higher occupancy costs related to an increase in the number of Company locations, and the higher regulatory costs described previously. 

Income Tax Expense 
 
 Comparison to Prior Quarter 
 
 For the third quarter 2024, the Company reported an income tax benefit of 55 million compared to a benefit of 101 million for the second quarter 2024. The effective tax rate for the third quarter 2024 was 16.34 percent compared to 23.69 percent for the second quarter 2024. The income tax benefit for the third quarter 2024 was lower than the second quarter 2024, primarily due to a lower book loss, primarily attributable to the lower provision for credit losses. Certain non-deductible items impacted the Company's effective tax rate, including the FDIC insurance expense and the bargain purchase gain adjustment. 
 
 Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the Company reported an income tax benefit of 210 million compared to an income tax expense of 141 million for the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 18.40 percent compared to 5.09 percent in the first nine months of 2023. The lower effective tax rate in 2023 is largely due to the tax impact of the Signature transaction being recorded as a reduction to the bargain gain and not included in income tax provision, consistent with purchase accounting requirements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 Balance Sheet Summary 
 
 Total assets increased 0.3 billion to 114.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 114.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The Company increased on-balance sheet liquidity in cash and cash equivalents by 11.6 billion, which was offset by reductions in balances of loans held for investment, as discussed further below. 
 
 Total loans and leases held for investment decreased 13.5 billion to 71.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 84.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the sale of the warehouse lending portfolio in the third quarter, along with reductions in commercial and industrial loans where we made strategic decisions to decrease the size of some of our lending positions and exit certain non-relationship-based customers. In addition, our commercial real estate and multi-family portfolios continue to decline as borrowers pay off their loans and we work to strategically reduce the concentration of these portfolios. 
 
 The securities portfolio increased 1.4 billion to 10.5 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.1 billion at December 31, 2023. Our securities portfolio is classified as available-for-sale with low credit risk U.S. government agency bonds comprising over 90 percent of the total portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These instruments are recorded at fair value and interest rate driven unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income. 
 
 Total deposits increased 1.5 billion, to 83.0 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 81.5 billion at December 31, 2023. In February and March 2024, we experienced 9.7 billion in deposit attrition following downgrades in our debt and deposit ratings by third-party credit rating agencies. On March 6, 2024 we announced a 1.05 billion capital raise, after which deposits stabilized for the remainder of the first quarter 2024. In response to the customer deposit attrition, we replaced the decline in deposits and increased our on-balance sheet liquidity, primarily through 4.1 billion in brokered certificates of deposit and 5.5 billion of wholesale borrowings. Subsequently in the second and third quarter 2024 our customer deposits increased substantially through targeted deposit gathering programs and private banking customer engagement which, along with the liquidity from the warehouse lending portfolio sale, allowed us to repay the wholesale borrowings from earlier in the year. 
 
 Certain assets and liabilities have been classified as held-for sale related to the sale of our mortgage servicing, subservicing, third-party mortgage origination activities and our mortgage servicing rights asset as of September 30, 2024.

Multi-Family Loans 
 
 The multi-family loan portfolio was 35.1 billion at September 30, 2024, down 2.1 billion compared to 37.3 billion at December 31, 2023. This is reflective of our continuing efforts to strategically diversify our portfolio as borrowers without a deposit relationship seek more favorable loan terms with other lenders. 
 
 Our multi-family loans may contain an initial interest-only period ; however, they are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis, including the calculation of the debt service coverage ratio. Whether a borrower qualifies for an interest-only period is based on the individual credit profile of the borrower, particularly the loan-to-value of the property. At September 30, 2024, we had 14.0 billion of multi-family loans in their interest-only period. These loans were originated with an average interest-only period of approximately 36 months. A s of September 30, 2024, there is a weighted average interest-only period of approximately 20 months rem aining . Approximately 56 percent of these loans enter their amortization period by the end of 2025. 
 
 The majority of our multi-family loans are non-recourse and are secured by rental apartment buildings. At September 30, 2024, 19.8 billion or 56 percent of the Company s total multi-family loan portfolio was secured by properties in New York State, many of which are subject to rent regulation laws to varying degrees. The New York Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (the "Act") significantly limits the ability to increase rents on regulated apartments upon vacancy. These limitations may reduce a borrower s ability to generate additional revenues on those units to offset higher operating expenses due to inflation and the current interest rate environment. This could result in lower net operating income and could impact a 
 15 

borrower s ability to satisfy repayment obligations during the term of the loan. In addition, the level of income generated by the property may be insufficient to qualify for refinancing at maturity. The impact on current and future cash flows has adversely impacted the value of properties with a high concentration of rent regulated units which has increased charge-offs in 2024. 
 
 To mitigate our exposure to rent regulated properties, we are curtailing future originations of such loans secured by rent-regulated properties. We are no longer utilizing mortgage brokers to refer loan origination opportunities to us. We are focusing originations and renewal retention on borrowers with whom we will have broader customer relationships beyond lending. Additionally, we are strategically diversifying our loan portfolio to shift from multi-family loans to other loan sectors. We have begun to add experienced commercial banking lenders and credit personnel which will impact our noninterest expense. 
 
 We continue to monitor our loans held for investment portfolio and the related allowance for credit losses, particularly 
 given the economic pressures facing the commercial real estate and multi-family markets. Although occupancy levels have historically tended to be stable due to below market rents, rent-regulated loans that are repricing are incurring debt service levels that, when combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, approach or exceed some properties net operating income and may require the borrower to support the loan from sources unrelated to the collateral until elevated interest rates subside. 
 
 The following table presents a geographical analysis of the multi-family loans in our held-for-investment loan portfolio:

Commercial Real Estate 
 
 At September 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans represented 9.2 billion, or 13.0 percent, of total loans held for investment, reflecting a 1.3 billion decrease compared to 10.5 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to payoffs, as well as charge-offs and loan sales. 
 
 Certain of our commercial real estate loans may contain an interest-only period; however, these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis, including calculation of the debt service coverage ratio. Whether a borrower qualifies for an interest-only period is based on the individual credit profile of the borrower and the loan-to-value of the property. 
 
 Substantially all commercial real estate loans we originate are non-recourse and are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use buildings, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. Occupancy levels for office space have declined substantially over the past three years which has had an impact on borrowers' 
 16 

net operating income and their ability to cover debt service. These unfavorable market conditions also lower the value of underlying collateral which has had a material impact on loan charge-offs in 2024.

Commercial and Industrial 
 
 The commercial and industrial loans we produce are primarily made to small and mid-size businesses and finance companies. Such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers, and include term loans, demand loans, and revolving lines of credit. 
 
 A broad range of commercial and industrial loans, both collateralized and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and other general corporate needs. In determining the term and structure of commercial and industrial loans, several factors are considered, including the purpose, the collateral, and the anticipated sources of repayment. Commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower, and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower s financial stability. 

One-to-Four Family Loans 
 
 At September 30, 2024, one-to-four family loans represented 5.2 billion, inclusive of 386 million of loans with government guarantees, or 7.4 percent of total loans held for investment, compared to 6.1 billion at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, non-government guaranteed loans in this portfolio had an average current FICO score of 743 and an average LTV of 51 percent. 
 
 17 

Other Loans 
 
 At September 30, 2024, other loans totaled 1.8 billion and consisted primarily of home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans, including home equity loans, second mortgage loans and overdraft loans. As of September 30, 2024, loans in this portfolio had an average curre nt FICO score of 751. 

Loans Held for Sale 
 
 Loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 totaled 1.9 billion, an increase of 0.7 billion compared to 1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. We classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell and when we change our intent for loans originated as held for investment. Our mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value. We estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, where available, or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates, prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral. 
 
 During the third quarter 2024, we completed the sale of our warehouse lending portfolio for approximately 6 billion. We sold the loans at par and incurred transaction costs of approximately 23 million related to the sale. 
 
 Assets Held for Sale 
 
 On October 31, 2024, we closed the previously announced sale of the residential mortgage servicing and sub-servicing business, the mortgage servicing rights asset and the third-party origination platform for approximately 1.3 billion in total cash consideration. This includes the sale of nearly all of the mortgage servicing rights, loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities classified as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale at September 30, 2024. This transaction is expected to increase our capital ratios by approximately 60 basis points. We expect to recognize a net gain on sale in the fourth quarter 2024 of approximately 175 million. We also expect to incur costs of approximately 75 million, primarily the impairment of capitalized assets and severance costs associated with the transaction. Additionally, we expect approximately 4 billion of custodial deposits associated with our mortgage servicing activities to transfer out of the Bank over the course of the five months following the October 31, 2024 close. 

Securities 
 
 Total securities were 10.5 billion, or 9 percent of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.2 billion, or 8 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2023 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of our securities were designated as Available-for-Sale . At September 30, 2024, 20 percent of our portfolio is comprised of floating rate securities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale, net of tax, was 468 million, compared to 581 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting changes in market interest rates. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, available-for-sale securities had an estimated weighted average life of six years. Included in the quarter-end amount were mortgage-related securities of 8.5 billion and other debt securities of 2.0 billion . 
 
 At the prior year-end, available-for-sale securities were 9.2 billion and had an estimated weighted average life of six years. Mortgage-related securities accounted for 6.6 billion of the year-end balance, with other debt securities accounting for the remaining 2.6 billion.

Borrowed Funds 
 
 The majority of our borrowed funds consist of secured wholesale borrowings, including Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances, Discount Window loans from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("FRB"), and repurchase agreements. We also have outstanding unsecured borrowings consisting of junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. At September 30, 2024, total borrowed funds decreased 8.6 billion to 20.3 billion from 28.9 billion at June 30, 2024, and 0.9 billion from December 31, 2023. The linked quarter decrease was a result of deploying liquidity from the sale of the warehouse lending portfolio and increased customer deposits to pay down debt. We expect to further decrease wholesale borrowings in the fourth quarter 2024 by approximately 2 billion. 
 
 Wholesale Borrowings 
 
 Wholesale borrowings at September 30, 2024 were 19.3 billion compared to 20.3 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 FHLB advances decreased to 18.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from 19.3 billion at December 31, 2023. FHLB advances are secured by eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities, under blanket collateral agreements with the FHLB. 250 million of our wholesale borrowings had callable features at September 30, 2024 and 2.0 billion had callable features at December 31, 2023. In the first quarter 2024, we increased our borrowing from the FHLB. In the third quarter 2024, the Company repaid over 4.5 billion of FHLB advances. We reclassified 5 million to interest expense from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the third quarter 2024 related to previously terminated hedges of forecasted cash flows associated with the repaid advances. 
 
 In the third quarter 2024, the Company also repaid 4 billion it had drawn from the FRB discount window early in the second quarter 2024, with available liquidity from customer deposit growth and the sale of the warehouse lending portfolio. The Company had 1.0 billion drawn under the Bank Term Funding Program in 2023 that remained outstanding at September 30, 2024, scheduled to mature in December 2024. The Company repaid this advance in October 2024. See Note 20 - Subsequent Events. 
 
 Repurchase agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 were 60 million. We did not have any repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2023 . These agreements primarily U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprise ("GSE") obligations as collateral and were entered into with either the FHLB or specific brokerage firms, in large part to ensure operational readiness of securities collateralized borrowing as a source of readily available funding. 
 
 See Note 11, Borrowed Funds, in Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings, our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt.

Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 816 million of FHLB-NY stock, at cost, and 329 million of FHLB-Indianapolis stock, at cost. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 861 million of FHLB-NY stock, at cost, and 329 million of FHLB-Indianapolis stock, at cost. The Company maintains an investment in FHLB stock partly in conjunction with its membership in the FHLB and partly related to its access to the FHLB funding it utilizes. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 219 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock, at cost. 

Credit Risk 
 
 To mitigate the potential for credit losses, we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent as described more fully in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 

Credit Quality 
 
 It is our practice to continually review the risk in our loan portfolio. The Company receives financial information from borrowers annually, and most of the financial information is received in the second calendar quarter. Upon receipt of updated borrower financial information, we perform an analysis to determine whether the cash flow from the underlying collateral is sufficient to meet the contractual loan payments, commonly referred to as the debt service coverage ratio. We consider the ability to cover debt service based upon the current contractual rate, or where a borrower s initial fixed rate period expires within 18 months, the lowest contractual rate reset option available under the loan terms using the current level for referenced indices. Loans for which the collateral does not have a debt service coverage ratio of 1.0 or higher under this analysis are rated substandard. We order appraisals for all substandard loans. Where an appraisal, net of estimated selling costs, does not support recovery of the loan carrying amount for collateral-dependent loans, we classify the loan as non-accrual, regardless of payment status, and charge the loan down to its recoverable amount. Once an appraisal is ordered it takes approximately two to three months to receive and appropriately review the results. All substandard loans, including non-accrual loans, are reappraised annually and evaluated to determine if an adjustment to the carrying amount is required. Loans that are on non-accrual and, separately, the largest substandard loans are reported and reviewed with the Risk Assessment Committee at least quarterly. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, 2.1 billion of multi-family loans reached their repricing date. Approximately one-third of these loans paid off, and over 80 percent of the remaining loans are current on their contractual payments at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Classified loans increased 1.2 billion to 11.4 billion in t he third quarter 2024, from 10.2 billion in the second quarter 2024 . These downgrades were principally related to loans with upcoming maturities or repricing where the estimated net operating income of the property would not be sufficient to fully cover pro-forma debt service when applying current market rates and terms. Classified loans reflect the potential that a loss may occur if deficiencies in the primary source of repayment are unable to be corrected and borrowers are unwilling or unable to otherwise support the loans. Refer to Note 6 - Loans and Leases in Item 1, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional details. 
 
 The procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories, with late charges assessed, and notices mailed to the borrower, at specified dates. We attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment. When contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property, we attempt to obtain full payment, and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action. Delinquencies are addressed by our Loan Workout Unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings. 

A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because there is significant uncertainty about whether we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement (principal and interest). When a loan is in non-accrual, we cease recording interest income on the loan, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income, and any subsequent interest collected is recorded as a reduction in the loan carrying amount. A loan is returned to accrual status only when the loan is current (minimum of six months of payment performance) and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible as to all contractual principal and interest. At September 30, 2024, 1.7 billion, or approximately 68 percent, of non-accrual loans were current based on their existing payment terms. 
 
 In accordance with our charge-off policy, collateral-dependent loans are written down to their current appraised values, less certain transaction costs. Workout specialists from our Loan Workout Unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in 
 20 

repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment. In addition, outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to support these efforts. Charge-offs o f 599 million w ere recorded on commercial real estate and multi-family loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily driven by appraisals received on those loans. 
 
 It is our policy to order updated appraisals for all substandard and non-accrual loans that are collateralized by multi-family buildings, commercial real estate properties, or land, if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old. Appraisals are ordered at least annually until such time as the loan becomes pass rated. It is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans that are not showing signs of credit weakness. However, appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount, a modification in loan terms, or an extension of a maturing loan, or when we determine an updated appraisal is needed as a result of our ongoing credit analysis. We evaluate loans that were previously placed on non-accrual at least quarterly to determine if additional charge-offs may be needed. 
 
 Properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less the estimated cost of selling the property. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in non-interest expense. It is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as other real estate owned before foreclosure and to re-appraise the properties on an as-needed basis, and not less than annually, until they are sold. We dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible, given current market conditions and the property s condition.

 (1) Includes home equity, consumer and other loans. 
 (2) Excludes 189 million of non-accrual held for sale loans. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the Company received updated financial information for a substantial portion of the commercial real estate and multi-family portfolio. Additionally a substantial number of appraisals on loans exhibiting credit weakness were received, which resulted in an increase in non-accrual loans from December 31, 2023. Approximately 68 percent of our non-accrual loans are current on their contractual payment terms. In determining whether to place a loan on non-accrual we have considered whether a borrower will be able to service its debt under terms expected within the next 18 months based on current collateral and net operating income. Where net operating income is below the projected debt service and the collateral value is below the loan amount, we place loans on non-accrual. Updated financial information from borrowers and appraisals received have led to an increase in non-accruals loans in 2024. 
 
 The following table sets forth the changes in non-accrual loans over the first nine months of 2024:

 23 

At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases was 1.3 billion compared to 1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, up 272 million. Market interest rates remain persistently high which will put pressure on the ability for certain borrowers with interest rates resetting at current levels to cover debt service. When combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties' net operating income, which increases the risk of loss. We believe that higher interest rates for a longer period of time will have a more significant impact on our loans that will reprice during the next 18 months. Therefore, we have incorporated a higher probability of default related to those loans as they approach their scheduled repricing date in the measurement of our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses is determined based on quantitative modeling that incorporates various economic forecast scenarios. The key inputs to our quantitative allowance for credit losses models include borrowers' projected debt service based on the most recent financial information available and underlying collateral property values. Property values are particularly meaningful for our multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios. Our models consider the entire life of the loan, including both the interest only period of the loan, if applicable, and the amortization period, to assess the probability of default and the loss given default. For our multi-family portfolio, we obtain and utilize current and projected geography-specific market information in our forecasts. In estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses, we have adjusted key inputs used by the model on an average basis for certain loans, most notably net operating income and property values to reflect weaknesses in the underlying data, including the recency of appraisal values, and the lack of significant loss history in available data, particularly for rent-regulated multi-family loans. We have also considered our recent appraisal experience and the valuation risk present in loans with outstanding appraisals in estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans held for investment ratio increased to 1.78 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.17 percent at December 31, 2023. Excluding loans with government guarantees and warehouse loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.80 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2023.

Liquidity Risk 
 
 We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, and to protect against temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. 
 
 On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: retail, institutional, and brokered deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 
 
 Bank Liquidity and Sources of Funding 
 
 We monitor our liquidity daily, and reporting to management and the Board occurs more frequently during times of stress. Our most liquid assets are cash, cash equivalents, and highly liquid investment securities classified as available-for-s. Additional liquidity stems from deposits, wholesale funding sources (including wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits) and approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the FHLB. These funding sources depend on the amount of mortgage loan collateral and available securities pledged. The Bank also has agreements with the Federal Reserve Bank to access the discount window, pledging certain loans and securities as collateral. 
 
 The following table summarizes our total liquidity from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources: 
 
 (in billions) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash at Federal Reserve 22.5 11.5 High-quality Liquid Assets 
 7.7 6.3 Total On-Balance Sheet Liquidity 
 30.2 17.8 FHLB Available Capacity 2.9 8.4 Discount Window Available Capacity 8.3 1.7 Total Liquidity 41.4 27.9 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our total liquidity (cash and cash equivalents, high-quality liquid assets and borrowing capacity), was 41.4 billion. The 11.6 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by actions to further bolster our on-balance sheet liquidity levels required of Category IV banks. Our FHLB available capacity is currently limited to overnight funding requests. 

Deposits 
 
 Our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors, including customer satisfaction, the rates of interest we pay, the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms. The majority of our deposits are retail in nature (i.e., they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or retail deposits acquired through business combinations); however, we also utilize brokered deposits depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources. From December 31, 2023 to March 7, 2024, we experienced 9.7 billion in core deposit attrition following the credit rating agency downgrades of our Company's credit and deposit ratings in February and March 2024. On March 6, 2024, we announced a 1.05 billion capital raise, after which deposits stabilized. We replaced the decline in deposits and increased our on-balance sheet liquidity, primarily through brokered certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings in the first quarter of 2024. Subsequently, in the second and third quarters of 2024, targeted deposit gathering programs and customer engagement increased customer deposits over 7 billion. 
 
 The following table presents the composition of the Company's brokered deposits:

 (1) Includes brokered certificate of deposit accounts of 11,559 million and 6,201 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, each of which includes all funds gathered from a single issuance. While each brokered certificate of deposit account has balances in excess of 250,000, the funds are fully insured by the FDIC as each of the ultimate owners of the funds maintain balances below FDIC insurance limits. 
 
 The following table indicates the amount of custodial deposits by source: 
 
 (in billions) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Custodial deposits from owned servicing 
 1.1 0.7 Custodial deposits from subservicing relationships 
 3.0 2.2 Non-servicing custodial deposits 
 5.1 3.7 9.2 6.6 
 
 Uninsured Deposits 
 
 We manage our liquidity to ensure our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand. As a result, we have total liquidity of 41.4 billion, which exceeds the balance of our uninsured deposits by 24.8 billion. Our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently 250,000). These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and exclude internal accounts. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our deposit base includes 16.6 billion of uninsured deposits. Uninsured deposits decreased following our earnings announcement in January 2024 and subsequent credit rating agency downgrades of our credit ratings in February and March 2024. 

Credit Ratings 
 
 We maintain credit ratings from three rating agencies: Moody s, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS. As of each of the dates indicated, our credit ratings were as follows: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Long-Term Issuer Rating: 
 Moody's 
 B2 Baa3 Baa3 Fitch 
 BB BBB BBB Morningstar DBRS 
 BBB (low) BBB (high) BBB (high) Short-Term Deposits Rating: 
 Moody's 
 NP P-2 P-2 
 
 The primary mortgage loan agencies maintain standards that define the criteria that must be met for an institution to qualify as an eligible custodial depository for the deposits related to loans owned by those entities, including have an investment grade short-term issuer/deposit rating from Moody s or S P. We are currently not in compliance with that criteria. We have received a waiver of these criteria for all of our custodial deposits which could be revoked at any of the agencies' discretion. We have no other direct contractual relationships tied to further downgrades in our credit ratings, but may suffer reputational risk that could have an adverse effect on our business should that occur. 
 
 27 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities, fund loan growth, operate our branch network, and address our capital needs. 
 
 For example, we offer certificates of deposit with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the FHLB. These contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition under Deposits and Borrowed funds, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we had certificates of deposit of 29.3 billion and long-term debt (defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more) of 14.3 billion. 
 
 We also are obligated under certain non-cancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our back-office responsibilities. These obligations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Condition in other liabilities and totaled 484 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 38 million compared to 446 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations, as well as commercial, performance stand-by and financial stand-by letters of credit. These commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in Fee income in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. 
 
 Based upon our current cash and cash equivalent balance of 23.1 billion and our total liquidity position of 41.4 billion, we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term. 
 
 For the third quarter 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no commitments to purchase securities. 

Parent Company Liquidity 
 
 The Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. At September 30, 2024, the Parent Company held cash and cash equivalents of 613 million. In addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases, the Parent Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our common and preferred stockholders. 
 
 Various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the Company s subsidiary bank can supply funds to the Parent Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank would currently require the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to declare dividends. We have reduced our quarterly cash dividends to common stockholders to 0.01 per common share and we do not anticipate material dividends from the Bank to the Parent Company until the Bank is able to achieve a return to repeatable operating income. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations through 2028. 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As a financial institution, we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility, which represents our primary market risk. Changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance, as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. To reduce our exposure to changing rates, the Board of Directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate. 
 
 The actual duration of held-for-investment mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates. The level of prepayments may, in turn, be impacted by a variety of factors, including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated; seasonal factors; demographic 
 28 

variables; and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 
 
 Interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The estimated percentage change in EVE, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The model assumes estimated loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayment rates, current market value spreads, and deposit decay rates and betas. 
 
 Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2024, the following table sets forth our EVE, assuming the changes in interest rates noted: 
 Change in Interest Rates (in basis points) Estimated Percentage Change in Economic Value of Equity -200 shock 3.1 -100 shock 2.0 +100 shock (3.4) +200 shock (6.1) 
 
 The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 
 
 While the EVE analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income, and may very well differ from actual results. 
 
 Interest rate risk is also monitored through the use of a model that generates net interest income ("NII") simulations over a range of interest rate scenarios. Modeling changes in NII requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NII analysis presented below assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. The assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table, due to the frequency, timing, and magnitude of changes in interest rates; changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories; and prepayments, among other factors, coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes. 
 
 Based on the information and assumptions in effect at September 30, 2024, the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months, assuming the changes in interest rates noted , and the current balance sheet mix : 
 
 Change in Interest Rates (in basis points) (1) 
 Estimated Percentage Change in Future Net Interest Income -200 shock (3.1) -100 shock (1.4) +100 shock 0.6 +200 shock 0.7 
 (1) In general, short- and long-term rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged. 
 
 The net changes in NII presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank. 
 
 Future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our EVE, and/or NII simulations. 
 
 29 

In the event that our EVE and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits, we would inform the Board of Directors and undertake actions to remediate, generally through capital market transactions. 
 
 Where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk, strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing other balance sheet management activities including the potential use of derivatives to reduce the risk exposure. Where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products, a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques. Other strategies might include: 
 
 Asset restructuring, involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles, or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets; 
 
 Liability restructuring, whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities; 
 
 Expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities; and/or 
 
 Use or alteration of off-balance sheet positions, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, options, and forward purchase or sales commitments. 
 
 A t September 30, 2024, the estimated change in net interest income over the next twelve months for a 100 basis point reduction in short term interest rates with no change in long term interest rates is -0.20 percent and the estimated change for a 100 basis point increase in short term rates is -0.6 percent.

Regulatory Capital and Requirements of Category IV Standards 
 
 The Company is a bank holding company subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve while the Bank is a national bank subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Effective October 1, 2023 we became subject to Category IV prudential standards which included heightened requirements related to capital, liquidity and risk management, as follows: 
 
 As a Category IV firm we maintain a capital plan approved by the Board of Directors which includes analysis under various company-derived stress scenarios. The Company submitted its 2024 capital plan to the Federal Reserve as required by regulation and received written feedback on the plan and associated governance which it has begun to address as part of the capital planning activities for 2025 and subsequent periods. Category IV institutions are subject to a supervisory stress test every other year. The supervisory stress test will first be applicable to the Company in 2026. 
 Category IV institutions are required to perform liquidity stress tests that consider the potential impact of market and idiosyncratic stresses over various time horizons, and to maintain an on-balance sheet liquidity buffer at least equal to the 30-day stress horizon. The Company has developed and continues to enhance its liquidity stress capabilities. As a result of the requirement to maintain a liquidity buffer, the Company significantly increased its on balance sheet liquidity during 2024. 
 Category IV firms are required to prepare and maintain formal resolution plans for actions to be undertaken in the event of firm failure. The FDIC issued a final rule revising the resolution plan requirements effective October 1, 2024. The Company will submit its first resolution plan under the final rule in mid-2025. The Company has a program underway to develop the resolution plan and does not expect any material impact to the Company in developing the plan. 
 Under regulatory heightened standards, a risk governance framework is required to be developed and maintained to manage and control the risk-taking activities of the firm. Management has developed a written framework and is implementing the various components in an integrated fashion as underlying business processes mature. Heightened standards also require risk limits, metrics, and analytics which monitor the size and direction of key risks in the organization. The Company has established risk limits which are monitored by the Board of Directors and continues to enhance related metrics and analytics. 
 
 The Bank is subject to the Prompt Corrective Action regulatory capital framework that establishes five categories of capital adequacy ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized. An institution s capital category affects various matters, including legal requirements for regulators to take prompt corrective action and the level of a bank s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") deposit insurance premium assessments. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weighting assets, among other factors, and the regulators have discretion to require that institutions maintain capital in excess of minimum levels. 
 
 The quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks and bank holding companies maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets (as such measures are defined in the regulations). At September 30, 2024, our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank. The following tables set forth the common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and leverage capital amounts and ratios for the Company on a consolidated basis and for the Bank on a stand-alone basis, as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements, as of the dates shown: 
 The following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company: 
 
 Risk-Based Capital September 30, 2024 Common Equity Tier 1 Tier 1 Total Leverage Capital (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total capital 8,182 10.76 8,686 11.42 10,585 13.92 8,686 7.32 Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,422 4.50 4,562 6.00 6,083 8.00 4,746 4.00 Excess 4,760 6.26 4,124 5.42 4,502 5.92 3,940 3.32 December 31, 2023 Total capital 8,009 9.05 8,512 9.62 10,415 11.77 8,512 7.75 Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,983 4.50 5,310 6.00 7,081 8.00 4,392 4.00 Excess 4,026 4.55 3,202 3.62 3,334 3.77 4,120 3.75 
 
 31 

The increase in our capital ratios from December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a 1.05 billion capital investment in the first quarter 2024 and a 12.5 billion reduction in risk weighted assets as a result of our strategic decisions to exit certain non-relationship-based businesses, including the sale of our warehouse lending portfolio which closed in the third quarter 2024. At the date of the capital investment, 413 million of the capital investment was recorded in common equity, with the remainder in mezzanine equity until the associated preferred stock was converted or exchanged into common stock. In the second and third quarters 2024, substantially all of the preferred stock converted to common stock. Refer to Note 17 - Mezzanine and Stockholders' Equity for additional details. 
 
 The following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the Bank: 
 
 Risk-Based Capital September 30, 2024 Common Equity Tier 1 Tier 1 Total Leverage Capital (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total capital 9,061 11.94 9,061 11.94 10,014 13.19 9,061 7.64 Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,415 4.50 4,554 6.00 6,072 8.00 4,743 4.00 Excess 5,646 7.44 4,507 5.94 3,942 5.19 4,318 3.64 December 31, 2023 Total capital 9,305 10.52 9,305 10.52 10,271 11.61 9,305 8.48 Minimum for capital adequacy purposes 3,980 4.50 5,307 6.00 7,076 8.00 4,389 4.00 Excess 5,325 6.02 3,998 4.52 3,195 3.61 4,916 4.48 
 
 The Bank also exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be categorized as well capitalized. To be categorized as well capitalized, a bank must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of 6.50 percent; a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent; a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent; and a minimum leverage capital ratio of 5 percent. 
 
 On July 25, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its residential mortgage servicing business, including mortgage servicing rights and third-party origination platform to an operating subsidiary of Mr. Cooper, Inc., a leading mortgage originator and servicer for approximately 1.3 billion. The transaction closed on October 31, 2024 and is expected to increase the common equity tier 1 ratios by approximately 60 basis points. 

Other Recent Developments 
 
 On November 16, 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register its final rule that imposes special assessments to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC continues to provide an updated estimate of each institution s quarterly and total special assessment expense and while we expect this may result in an increase, we do not expect the increase to be material. The final rule calls for the FDIC to collect special assessments over eight quarterly assessment periods, We have made two payments to date, the first of which was paid in June 2024. 
 
 On July 27, 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would make significant amendments to the Basel III Capital Rules applicable to both the Company and the Bank. In general, the proposed rule would align the regulatory capital calculation methodology for Category III and IV banking organizations with the methodology applicable to Category I and II banking organizations. In addition to calculating risk-weighted assets under the current U.S. standardized approach, the proposal introduces a new Expanded Risk-Based Approach, including standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, as well as a new approach for market risk that would be based upon internal models and standardized supervisory models. If adopted as proposed, the Company and the Bank would be required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the current U.S. standardized approach and the Expanded Risk-Based Approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for each risk-based capital ratio. In addition, the proposal would require banking organizations to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital, including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and lower thresholds for deductions from CET1 capital for mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets, among other things. The proposal, if enacted, would have an effective date of July 1, 2025, with certain elements, such as the recognition of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital and changes in risk-weighted assets calculated under the Expanded Risk-Based Approach, having a three-year phase-in period. The proposal has not been finalized. Recent public statements suggest changes to the proposal will ultimately be made before it is finalized and the only significant provisions likely to affect the Company are those related to AOCI. We are in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact on the Company and the Bank if adopted as proposed. 
 32 

On August 29, 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies issued for public comment a proposal that would require banks with more than 100 billion in total consolidated assets, to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt LTD that can be used, in the instance of a bank s failure, to absorb losses and increase options to resolve the failed bank. Under the proposal, the required minimum amount of LTD would be the greater of 6 percent of an entity s total risk-weighted assets, 3.5 percent of an entity s average total consolidated assets, or 2.5 percent of an entity s total leverage exposure if it is subject to the supplementary leverage ratio. Debt instruments issued to satisfy the minimum LTD requirement would need to be unsecured, have maturities greater than one year and have plain vanilla features (e.g., no structured notes or credit sensitive instruments). The proposal would further subject banks to certain clean holding-company requirements, such as a prohibition on entering into derivatives with external counterparties. The proposal would provide a three-year transition period with the incremental phase-in of the requirements during this period. The proposal has not been finalized. 
 
 We identified certain material weaknesses in management's report on internal control over financial reporting included within Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our progress toward remediation as of September 30, 2024 is discussed within Item 4 of this Form 10-Q. We do not expect the operational costs to remediate these material weaknesses to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Certain accounting policies that, due to the judgment, estimates and assumptions are critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes, are described in Item 1. These policies relate to: (a) the determination of our allowance for credit losses, (b) valuation of mortgage servicing rights and (c) the acquisition method of accounting. We believe the judgment, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations and/or financial condition. 
 
 For further information on our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is available on our website, under the Investor Relations section, or on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission, at sec.gov.

The Company has grown organically and through a series of mergers and acquisitions, culminating in its acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. ("Flagstar Bancorp"), which closed on December 1, 2022 and the Signature Transaction (as defined within Note 3 - Business Combinations) which closed on March 20, 2023. 
 
 Flagstar Bank, N.A. currently operates branches across states, including strong footholds in the Northeast and Midwest and exposure to markets in the Southeast and West Coast. Flagstar Mortgage operates nationally. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 On a consolidated basis, our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources: retail, institutional, and brokered deposits; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. 
 
 We manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations, to protect against temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand, and to meet our financial obligations.

anniversary of the Signature Transaction. In addition, as part of the consideration for the Signature Transaction, the Company granted the FDIC equity appreciation rights in the common stock of the Company under an equity appreciation instrument (the "Equity Appreciation Instrument"). On March 31, 2023, the Company issued shares of Company common stock to the FDIC pursuant to the Equity Appreciation Instrument. On May 19, 2023, the FDIC completed the secondary offering of those shares. 
 
 The Company has determined that the Signature Transaction constitutes a business combination as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements as to how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Accordingly, the Company recorded the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of March 20, 2023, which was subject to adjustment for up to after March 20, 2023 (the Measurement Period ). The Measurement Period concluded on March 20, 2024, and the Company has finalized its review of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 
 Under the Agreement, the Company provided certain services to the FDIC to assist the FDIC in its administration of certain assets and liabilities which were not assumed by the Company and which remain under the control of the FDIC (the Interim Servicing ). The FDIC reimbursed the Company for costs associated with the Interim Servicing based upon an agreed upon fee which approximates the cost to provide such services. The Interim Servicing was completed in March 2024. 
 
 The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash ows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change.

 In connection with the Signature Transaction, the Company recorded a bargain purchase gain, as adjusted, of approximately billion. This includes a million reduction in the bargain purchase gain during the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to final adjustments to the fair value of assets received and liabilities assumed, including the in-transit and other shared accounts. This adjustment is included in non-interest income in the Company s Consolidated Statement of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. No adjustments have been made subsequent to the conclusion of the Measurement Period on March 20, 2024. 
 
 The bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the assets acquired (including cash payments received from the FDIC) over the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed and was influenced significantly by the FDIC-assisted transaction process.

 During the Measurement Period, the Company recorded adjustments to the estimated fair value of loans and leases acquired based on information received after the transaction date, and to adjust other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities for balances ultimately retained by the FDIC. The Company also recognized a net change in the deferred tax liability due to the measurement period adjustments and the secondary offering of shares completed by the FDIC.

 The Company s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Signature subsequent to the acquisition on March 20, 2023. Due to the use of multiple systems and integration of the operating activities into those of the Company, historical reporting for the former Signature operations is impracticable and thus disclosures of the revenue from the assets acquired and income before income taxes is impracticable for the period subsequent to acquisition. 
 
 Signature was only in operation from March 12, 2023 to March 20, 2023 and does not have historical financial information on which we could base pro forma information. Additionally, we did not acquire all assets or assume all liabilities

 The Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions at least quarterly to determine if an allowance for credit losses is required. We also assess whether (i) we intend to sell, or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, any previously recognized allowances are charged off and the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. If neither of these criteria are met, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount

 We classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell and when we change our intent about holding for investment. Mortgage loans held for sale for which, we have elected the fair value option are carried at fair value. Loans originally held for investment that we have changed our intent and plan to sell are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market. We estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans, where available, or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates, prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral.

 Asset Quality 
 
 All asset quality information excludes loans with government guarantees that are insured by U.S. government agencies. A s of September 30, 2024, these loans totaled million. 
 
 A loan generally is classified as a non-accrual loan when it is 90 days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, management ceases recording interest income, and previously accrued interest is reversed against interest income. A loan is only returned to accrual status when the loan is current (typically a minimum of of payment performance) and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible. Interest received on non-accrual loans is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had loans that were 90 days or more past due and still accruing.

billion compared to billion at December 31, 2023, up million. Interest rates remain persistently high which will put pressure on the ability for certain borrowers with interest rates resetting at current levels to cover debt service. When combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates, debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties' net operating income, which increases the risk of loss. We believe that higher interest rates for a longer period of time will have a more significant impact on our loans that will reprice during the next months. Although the short-term interest rate reduction announced by the Federal Reserve during the third quarter 2024 does alleviate some pressure on our borrowers, rates remain high and uncertainty remains for future potential rate reductions. Therefore, we have incorporated a higher probability of default related to those loans as they approach their scheduled repricing date in the measurement of our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses is determined based on quantitative modeling that incorporates and weighs economic forecast scenarios. The key inputs to our quantitative allowance for credit losses models include borrowers' projected debt service based on the most recent financial information available and underlying collateral property values. Property values are particularly meaningful for our multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios. Our models consider the entire life of the loan, including both the interest only period of the loan, if applicable, and the amortization period, to assess the probability of default and the loss given default. For our multi-family portfolio, we obtain and utilize current and projected geography-specific market information in our forecasts. In estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses, we have adjusted key inputs used by the model on an average basis for certain loans, most notably net operating income and property values to reflect weaknesses in the underlying data, including the recency of appraisal values, and the lack of significant loss history in available data, particularly for multi-family loans and, most notably, rent-regulated multi-family loans. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for unfunded commitments totaled million and million, respectively. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans held for investment ratio increased to percent at September 30, 2024, compared to percent at December 31, 2023. Excluding loans with government guarantees and warehouse loans, the allowance for credit losses was percent at September 30, 2024, compared to percent at December 31, 2023.

 to months. At the end of the lease term, the lessee usually has the option to return the equipment, to renew the lease or purchase the equipment at the then fair market value FMV price. For leases with a FMV renewal/purchase option, the relevant residual value assumptions are based on the estimated value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, including evaluation of key factors, such as, the estimated remaining useful life of the leased asset, its historical secondary market value including history of the lessee executing the FMV option, overall credit evaluation and return provisions. The Company acquires the leased asset at fair market value and provides funding to the respective lessee at acquisition cost, less any volume or trade discounts, as applicable. Therefore, there is generally no selling profit or loss to recognize or defer at inception of a lease.

For the vast majority of the Company s leases, we are not reasonably certain we will exercise our options to renew to the end of all renewal option periods. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 
 Right of use asset assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the vast majority of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate (FHLB borrowing rate) is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. The operating lease right of use asset is measured at cost, which includes the initial measurement of the lease liability, prepaid rent and initial direct costs incurred by the Company, less incentives received.

 Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of amounts subject to variability caused by changes in interest rates from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
 
 Interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling billion as of December 31, 2023 were designated as cash flow hedges of certain FHLB borrowings. There were designated hedging relationships as of September 30, 2024.

 In the third quarter 2024, the Company repaid billion of FHLB advances that were associated with previously de-designated cash flow hedging relationships. As no future cash flows will occur as a result of the repayments, the Company reclassified the gain of approximately million out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense during the quarter. 
 
 Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate borrowings. We will recognize million of lower interest expense over the next rolling twelve month period related to the reclassification.

 The Company reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications for its assets on a quarterly basis. Changes from one quarter to the next that are related to the observability of inputs for a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from one hierarchy level to another. 
 A description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair values of securities follows: 
 Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government securities and exchange-traded securities. 
 If quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, models incorporate transaction details such as maturity and cash flow assumptions. Securities valued in this manner would

 The fair values of collateral-dependent impaired loans are determined using various valuation techniques, including consideration of appraised values and other pertinent real estate and other market data. 
 Other Fair Value Disclosures 
 For the disclosure of fair value information about the Company s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments, when available, quoted market prices are used as the measure of fair value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on present-value estimates or other valuation techniques. Such fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used, the timing of future cash flows, and the discount rate. 
 Because assumptions are inherently subjective in nature, estimated fair values cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes. Furthermore, in many cases, the estimated fair values provided would not necessarily be realized in an immediate sale or settlement of such instruments.

 The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair values for the Company s financial instruments follow: 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and federal funds sold. The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to equal their carrying values, as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities. 
 Securities 
 If quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, pricing models also incorporate transaction details such as maturities and cash flow assumptions. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 
 Ownership in equity securities of the FHLB is generally restricted and there is no established liquid market for their resale. The carrying amount approximates the fair value. 
 76 

. 
 
 Rate lock commitments 
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the rate lock commitments is the pull through rate. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e. the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 
 Deposits 
 The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., interest-bearing checking and money market accounts, savings accounts, and non-interest-bearing accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair values of certificates of deposit represent contractual cash flows, discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. These estimated fair values do not include the intangible value of core deposit relationships, which comprise a portion of the Company s deposit base. 
 Borrowed Funds 
 The estimated fair value of borrowed funds is based either on bid quotations received from securities dealers or the discounted value of contractual cash flows with interest rates currently in effect for borrowed funds with similar maturities and structures. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 
 The fair values of commitments to extend credit and unadvanced lines of credit are estimated based on an analysis of the interest rates and fees currently charged to enter into similar transactions, considering the remaining terms of the commitments and the creditworthiness of the potential borrowers. The estimated fair values of such off-balance sheet financial instruments were insignificant at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Fair Value Option 
 We elected the fair value option for certain items as discussed throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to more closely align the accounting method with the underlying economic exposure. Interest income on loans held for sale is accrued on the principal outstanding primarily using the "simple-interest" method.

 Mortgage Servicing Rights 
 
 The Company has investments in mortgage servicing rights that result from the sale of loans to the secondary market for which we retain the servicing. The Company accounts for mortgage servicing rights at fair value. A primary risk associated with mortgage servicing rights is the potential reduction in fair value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments due to loan refinancing prompted, in part, by declining interest rates or government intervention. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. The Company utilizes derivatives as economic hedges to offset changes in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments stemming from changing interest rate environments. There is also a risk of valuation decline due to higher than expected default rates, which we do not believe can be effectively managed using derivatives. For further information regarding the derivative instruments utilized to manage our mortgage servicing rights risk, see Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities. On October 31, 2024, the Company completed the sale of a significant portion of its mortgage servicing rights. See Note 20 - Subsequent Events.

 The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. To isolate the effect of the specified change, the fair value shock analysis is consistent with the identified adverse change, while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, a change in one assumption generally impacts other assumptions, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. For further information on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, see Note 16 - Fair Value Measures . 
 Contractual servicing and subservicing fees, including late fees and other ancillary income are presented below. Contractual servicing fees are included within net return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

 Loans held-for-investment and Other Liabilities 
 
 The Company originated government guaranteed loans which were pooled and sold as Ginnie Mae MBS. Pursuant to Ginnie Mae servicing guidelines, the Company has the unilateral right to repurchase loans securitized in Ginnie Mae pools that are due, but unpaid, for consecutive months. As a result, once the delinquency criteria have been met, and regardless of whether the repurchase option has been exercised, the Company accounts for the loans as if they had been repurchased. At December 31, 2023, the Company recognized the loans and corresponding liability as loans held for investment and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. At September 30, 2024, the loans and corresponding liability were presented as assets held for sale and liabilities associates with assets held for sale, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. On October 31, 2024, million of the loans held for sale and the corresponding liability related to the repurchase option were sold. See Note 20 - Subsequent Events. 
 
 Other Assets 
 
 Other assets included in assets held for sale at September 30, 2024 are substantially all related to corporate and escrow advances, which are short-term receivables related to advances made by the Company in connection with the servicing of mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024, corporate and escrow advances classified as assets held for sale totaled million.

 Under the supervision, and with the participation, of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b), as adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, based on additional analyses and other procedures performed, management concluded that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial position, results of operations, capital position, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Per Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In the fourth quarter of 2023, management identified the following internal control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses. 
 
 Control environment : Our Board of Directors did not exercise sufficient oversight responsibilities which led to us lacking a sufficient complement of qualified leadership resources to conduct effective risk assessment and monitoring activities. 
 
 Risk assessment : We lacked effective periodic risk assessment processes to identify and timely respond to emerging risks in certain financial reporting processes and related internal controls, including internal loan review that were responsive to changes in the business operations and regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates. 
 
 Monitoring : Our recurring monitoring activities over process level control activities, including internal loan review were not operating effectively. 
 
 Control activities : We did not sufficiently maintain effective control activities related to internal loan review. Specifically, our internal loan review processes lacked an appropriate framework to ensure that ratings were consistently accurate, timely, 
 85 

and appropriately challenged. These ineffective controls impact the Company s ability to accurately disclose loan rating classifications, identify problem loans, and ultimately the recognition of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. 
 
 These control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and therefore we concluded the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Remediation Status of Reported Material Weaknesses 
 
 The Company is continuing to actively work to remediate the material weaknesses described above, including assessing the need for additional remediation steps and implementing additional measures to remediate the underlying causes that gave rise to the material weaknesses, including governance and oversight to ensure an effective control environment. 
 
 To address the material weakness in our control environment, we have taken the following actions: 
 
 Appointed several new members to the Board of Directors with extensive experience as financial experts in our industry and backgrounds in risk management, including a new Lead Independent Director, a new Chairman of the Audit Committee and a new Chairman of the Risk Assessment Committee. The number of Audit Committee meetings held has increased substantially, and both Audit and Risk Assessment Committee meetings have dedicated sessions related to evaluating credit risk in the portfolio and the Company s methodology and results in determining the allowance for credit losses. Additionally the Company has hired a new Chief Credit Officer and new Senior Director of Credit Review, obtained current financial information for the majority of the portfolio, and revised procedures and criteria for grading of loans. 
 
 To address the material weakness in our risk assessment processes, we have taken or are in the process of taking the following actions: 
 
 Appointed a new Chief Risk Officer, a new Chief Credit Officer and, during the third quarter of 2024, a new Senior Director of Credit Review with large bank commercial loan credit review experience. 
 We are enhancing the current depth and breadth of our independent Credit Review program to make the necessary changes to the scoping approach, the risk assessment and identification processes, and to enhance the independence and stature of the independent Credit Review function. We have improved the framework being utilized by the independent Credit Review function and the level of experience of the personnel performing those reviews. 
 
 To address the material weakness in our monitoring activities, we have taken the following actions: 
 
 Increased the frequency and nature of reporting from our independent Credit Review team and first line business units to the Risk Assessment Committee to support the Board of Directors' risk oversight role. 
 
 To address the material weakness related to independent Credit Review control activities, we have taken or are in the process of taking the following actions: 
 
 Expanding the use of independent credit analysis and reducing the Company's reliance on tools and analysis prepared by our lines of business. 
 Hired a new Senior Director of Credit Review, and increased the Credit Review team's ability and stature within the organization to independently challenge risk rating scorecard model methodologies and results. 
 Assessing the adequacy of staffing levels and expertise within the Company s internal loan review practices, considering, among other things, the size, complexity, and risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio and while in the hiring process are utilizing third parties to increase independent credit review capacity to deal with emerging risk and the pace of change in our portfolio. 
 Providing additional risk rating process training for all employees involved in the lending and credit review processes. 
 Enhancing processes to identify and assess risks associated with determining the allowance for credit losses, including developing challenger approaches based on estimating collateral values using recent market and borrower property financial information. 
 
 86 

While we believe our actions will be effective in remediating the material weaknesses, we are continuing to assess the need for additional remediation actions to ensure we have the controls in place to accurately disclose loan rating classifications, identify problem loans, and ultimately the recognition of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, which may include the continued enhancement of reserving calculations to supplement existing models as well as the development of new models. The material weaknesses will not be fully remediated until all aspects of the credit risk management and allowance for loan loss quantification weaknesses are addressed, the applicable remedial processes and procedures have been in place for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that our efforts have been effective. Accordingly, the material weaknesses in our control environment were not remediated as of September 30, 2024 and therefore management concluded the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except for the actions noted above related to remediation of the Company's material weaknesses, there have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company is involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business. All such actions in the aggregate involve amounts that are believed by management to be immaterial to the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 and below for information regarding risk factors that could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition, or future results of operations. Other than as set forth below, there have been no other changes with regard to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 
 Failure to maintain an adequate level of liquidity could result in an inability to fulfill our financial obligations, could subject us to material reputational and compliance risk, and could lead to financial failure of the Company. 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are the retail and institutional deposits we gather or acquire in connection with acquisitions, and the brokered deposits we accept; borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the FHLB-NY and various Wall Street brokerage firms; cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans; and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities. In addition, and depending on current market conditions, we may have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time to generate additional liquidity. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings, and the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived; local and national economic conditions; and competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve. Deposit outflows can occur for a number of reasons, including clients seeking higher yields, clients with uninsured deposits may seek greater financial security or clients may simply prefer to do business with our competitors, or for other reasons. The withdrawal of more deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding, if not replaced by similar deposit funding, would need to be replaced with more expensive wholesale funding, the sale of interest-earning assets, other sources of funding, or a combination of them all. In extreme situations, withdrawals could exceed our capacity to fund the withdrawals and lead to financial failure of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 20 percent of our total deposits of 83.0 billion were not FDIC-insured. 
 
 In addition, large-scale withdrawals of brokered or institutional deposits could require us to pay significantly higher interest rates on our retail deposits or on other wholesale funding sources, which would have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income. Furthermore, changes to the FHLB-NY s underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow, and therefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity. A decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, and meet our expenses, or to fulfill such obligations as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands. Downgrades of the credit ratings of the Company and the Bank, such as those announced by certain credit rating agencies in February, March and May 2024, could result in an acceleration in deposit outflows and additional collateral needs, They could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or to purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including our liquidity. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses might not be sufficient to cover our actual losses, which would adversely impact our financial condition, regulatory capital ratios and results of operations. 
 
 In addition to mitigating credit risk through our underwriting processes, we attempt to recognize such risk through the establishment of an allowance for credit losses. The process of determining whether or not the allowance is sufficient to cover potential credit losses is based on the current expected credit loss model or current expected credit loss. Current expected credit loss may result in greater volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses, depending on various assumptions and factors 
 88 

used in determining the allowance for credit losses principally through mathematical modeling. If the judgments and assumptions we make with regard to the allowance are incorrect, our allowance for losses on such loans might not be sufficient, and an additional provision for credit losses might need to be made. 
 
 Depending on the amount of such loan loss provisions, the adverse impact on our earnings could be material. 
 
 Furthermore, bank regulators have the authority to require us to make provisions for credit losses or otherwise recognize loan charge-offs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio, our underwriting procedures, and our allowance for losses on such loans. Any increase in the loan loss allowance or in loan charge-offs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our concentration in multi-family loans and commercial real estate loans could expose us to increased lending risks and related loan losses. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, 35.1 billion or 49.4 percent of our total loans and leases, held for investment portfolio consisted of multi-family loans and 9.2 billion or 13.0 percent consisted of commercial real estate loans. These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the sale of such properties securing the loans. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential loans. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. In addition, if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 The commercial real estate loans we make are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use buildings, and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At September 30, 2024, 2.5 billion, or 27.6 percent of our commercial real estate loan portfolio was secured by office buildings. We may incur future losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates in office buildings, which could occur as a result of less need for office space due to more people working from home or other factors. 
 
 Our New York State multi-family loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 On June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the New York Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. This legislation represents the most extensive reform of New York State s rent laws in several decades and generally limits a landlord s ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing the Company s multi-family loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Economic weakness in the New York City metropolitan region, where the majority of the properties collateralizing our multi- family, commercial real estate, and acquisition, development and construction loans, and the majority of the businesses collateralizing our other commercial and industrial loans, are located could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in the New York City metropolitan region, where the majority of the buildings and properties securing the multi-family, commercial real estate, and acquisition, development and construction loans we originate for investment and the businesses of the customers to whom we make our other commercial and industrial loans are located. Accordingly, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans, may be significantly affected by economic conditions in this region, including changes in the local real estate market. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, acts of terrorism, extreme weather, or other factors beyond our control, could therefore have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because multi-family and commercial real estate loans represent the majority of the loans in our portfolio, a decline in tenant occupancy or rents, due to such factors, or for other reasons, such as new legislation, could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans on a timely basis, which could have a negative impact on our net income. Furthermore, economic or market turmoil could occur in the near or long term. This could 
 89 

negatively affect our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain the level of cash dividends we currently pay to our stockholders. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risk 
 
 Inability to fulfill minimum capital requirements could limit our ability to conduct or expand our business, pay a dividend, or result in termination of our FDIC deposit insurance, and thus impact our financial condition, our results of operations, and the market value of our stock. 
 
 We are subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation set forth by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Such regulation includes, among other matters, the level of leverage and risk-based capital ratios we are required to maintain. Depending on general economic conditions, changes in our capital position could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and risk profile, and also could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or otherwise. Compliance with regulatory capital requirements may limit our ability to engage in operations that require the intensive use of capital and therefore could adversely affect our ability to maintain our current level of business or expand. Furthermore, it is possible that future regulatory changes could result in more stringent capital or liquidity requirements, including increases in the levels of regulatory capital we are required to maintain and changes in the way capital or liquidity is measured for regulatory purposes, either of which could adversely affect our business and our ability to expand. For example, federal banking regulations adopted under Basel III standards require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with higher capital requirements. Any additional requirements to increase our capital ratios or liquidity could necessitate our liquidating certain assets, perhaps on terms that are unfavorable to us or that are contrary to our business plans. In addition, such requirements could also compel us to issue additional securities, thus diluting the value of our common stock. In addition, failure to meet established capital requirements could result in the Federal Reserve Board and/or Office of the Comptroller of the Currency placing limitations or conditions on our activities and further restricting the commencement of new activities. The failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends; issuing a directive to increase our capital; and terminating our FDIC deposit insurance. 
 
 Our results of operations could be materially affected by the imposition of restrictions on our operations by bank regulators, further changes in bank regulation, or by our ability to comply with certain existing laws, rules, and regulations governing our industry. 
 
 We are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the following entities: (1) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; (2) the FDIC; (3) the Federal Reserve Board-NY; and (4) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as state licensing restrictions and limitations regarding certain consumer finance products. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank holding company and its banking subsidiaries may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund, the banking system in general, and bank customers, rather than for the benefit of a company s stockholders. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company, the imposition of significant fines, the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications, the payment of dividends, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses, among other matters. Failure to comply (or to ensure that our agents and third-party service providers comply) with laws, regulations, or policies, including our failure to obtain any necessary state or local licenses, could result in enforcement actions or sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Penalties for such violations may also include: revocation of licenses; fines and other monetary penalties; civil and criminal liability; substantially reduced payments by borrowers; modification of the original terms of loans, permanent forgiveness of debt, or inability to, directly or indirectly, collect all or a part of the principal of or interest on loans provided by the Bank. Changes in such regulation and supervision, or changes in regulation or enforcement by such authorities, whether in the form of policy, regulations, legislation, rules, orders, enforcement actions, ratings, or decisions, could have a material impact on the Company, our subsidiary bank and other affiliates, and our operations, including restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company and changes in FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. In addition, failure of the Company or the Bank to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and capital. See Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1, Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a detailed description of the federal, state, and local regulations to which the Company and the Bank are subject. 
 
 90 

As a Category IV banking organization with over 100 billion in assets, we are subject to stringent regulations, including reporting, capital stress testing, and liquidity risk management. Non-compliance could result in regulatory risks and restrictions on our activities. 
 
 As a result of the Signature Transaction, our total assets exceeded 100 billion and therefore we became classified as a Category IV banking organization under the rules issued by the federal banking agencies that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to large bank holding companies and the capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. As a Category IV banking organization we are subject to enhanced liquidity risk management requirements which include reporting, liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer and resolution planning, subject to the applicable transition periods. If we were to meet or exceed certain other thresholds for asset size, we would become subject to additional requirements. Failure to meet these requirements could expose us to compliance risks, higher penalties, increased expectations, and limitations on our activities. As a Category IV banking organization, we are required to implement and maintain an adequate liquidity risk management and monitoring process to ensure compliance with these requirements, and our failure to ensure compliance may have adverse consequences on our operations, reputation and future profitability. We anticipate incurring significant expenses to develop policies, programs, and systems that comply with the enhanced standards applicable to us. 
 
 Our enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject, based upon the size, scope, and complexity of the Company. 
 
 As a financial institution, we are subject to a number of risks, including interest rate, credit, liquidity, legal/compliance, market, strategic, operational, and reputational. Our Enterprise Risk Management framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. For example, economic and market conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, and increases in the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated, highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques. As a result, the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, an ineffective Enterprise Risk Management framework, as well as other risk factors, could result in a material increase in our FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. 
 
 Legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and risks can subject us to heightened scrutiny and reputational damage. 
 
 Data privacy and cybersecurity risks have become a subject of heightened legislative and regulatory focus in recent years. Federal Banking Agencies have proposed regulations to enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to us and our third-party service providers. These regulations focus on areas such as cyber risk governance, management of dependencies, incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. State-level legislation and regulations have also been proposed or adopted, requiring notification to individuals in the event of a security breach of their personal data. Examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other state-level privacy, data protection, and data security laws and regulations. We collect, maintain, and use non-public personal information of our customers, clients, employees, and others. The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of this information are governed by federal and state laws. Compliance with these laws is essential to protect the privacy of personal information and avoid potential liability and reputational damage. Failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations may expose us to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions. It may also require changes to our systems, business practices, or privacy policies, which could adversely impact our operating results. Privacy initiatives have imposed and will continue to impose additional operational burdens on us. These initiatives may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of personal data. New privacy and data protection initiatives, such as the CCPA, may require changes to policies, procedures, and technology for information security and data segregation. Non-compliance with these initiatives may make us more vulnerable to operational 
 failures and subject to monetary penalties, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions. 
 
 We are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings. 
 
 At any given time, we are involved with a number of legal proceedings and regulatory investigations and examinations as a part of reviews conducted by regulators and other parties, which may involve banking, securities, consumer protection, employment, tort, and numerous other laws and regulations. The outcome of pending or threatened litigation, or of investigations or any other matters before regulatory agencies is uncertain, whether currently existing or commencing in the 
 91 

future, including with respect to any litigation, investigation or other regulatory actions related to (i) the business and disclosure practices of acquired companies, including our acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp and the purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities of Signature, (ii) the capital raise transaction we completed in March of 2024, (iii) the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, (iv) past cyber security breaches, and (v) recent events and circumstances involving the Company, including our full year 2023 earnings announcement, disclosures regarding credit losses, provisioning and goodwill impairment, and negative news and expectations about the prospects of the Company (and associated stock price volatility and changes). Proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, business improvement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, ratings downgrades, restrictions on our business activities, changes in FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments or other results adverse to us, which could materially and negatively affect our business. If such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations. We are currently subject to stockholder class and derivative actions which seek significant damages and other relief, and may be subject to similar actions in the future. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a materially adverse effect on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition and results of operations. Claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop, making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations. Although we establish accruals for legal or regulatory proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal or regulatory proceedings where we face a risk of loss. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question. As a result, our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. 
 
 Oversight and Operational Risk 
 
 The Company recently experienced turnover in its Board of Directors and executive management team and is embarking upon a new strategic plan, which creates uncertainties and could harm its business. 
 
 The Company has experienced significant changes in its Board of Directors and executive leadership during 2024. On or shortly after March 11, 2024, Thomas Cangemi, James Carpenter, Leslie Dunn, Lawrence Rosano Jr, Ronald Rosenfeld, Lawrence Savarese, David Treadwell and Robert Wann resigned as directors of the Board. Additionally, Toan C. Huynh and Hanif (Wally) Dahya resigned as directors of the Board in February 2024 and Peter Schoels resigned as a director of the Board in October 2024. Three directors who were serving on the Board as of December 31, 2023 continue to serve on the Board: Alessandro P. DiNello, Marshall J. Lux, and Jennifer R. Whip. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, Peter Schoels resigned as a director of the Board. Additionally, on or shortly after March 11, 2024, five new directors were appointed to the Board: Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Joseph Otting, Milton Berlinski, Allen Puwalski and Alan Frank. Additionally, there have been a number of new appointments to the executive management team during the year. 
 
 On July 25, 2024, the Company announced five strategic objectives for the remainder of 2024: (1) bolster management and the Board; (2) ongoing execution of the operating plan; (3) achievable capital and earnings forecast; (4) improve funding profile; and (5) focus on credit risk. The Company is in the process of developing a 2025-2027 Strategic Plan and expects to obtain Board approval by year end 2024. 
 
 Changes to strategic or operating goals, which can often times occur with the appointment of new Board members and new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact the Company's ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of the Company's operations. Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. If the Company does not integrate new executives and Board members successfully, the Company may be unable to manage and grow its business, and its financial condition and profitability may suffer as a result. 
 
 In addition, the Company s future success will depend on the ability of the Board and the executive management team to effectively develop, implement, and execute a strategic plan. There are risks and uncertainties associated with the creation, implementation and execution of a new strategic plan, including the investment of time and resources, the possibility that such strategic plan will ultimately be unprofitable or unsuccessful, and the risk of additional liabilities associated with such strategic 
 92 

plan. The Company s successful execution of any strategic plan will require market conditions that will allow the Company to achieve its strategic goals. To the extent the Company is unable to successfully develop, implement, and execute a strategic plan, or if it experiences delays in the development, planning and implementation process, the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 Completing the diversification of the Company s loan portfolio may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the plan may not be realized. 
 
 The Company is pursuing a plan to diversify its loan portfolio, which contemplates reducing its commercial real estate concentration, and allow other non-strategic assets to be run off or sold. Implementing and completing this plan is expected to take a considerable amount of time and attention of management and staff as they work to identify, negotiate and execute upon opportunities to reposition the loan portfolio, divest certain assets and effect potential transactions. 
 
 It is possible that the process of diversifying the Company s loan portfolio could result in substantial disruption of the Company's business and operations, as the Company may face the unexpected loss of key employees that it relies on to assist with the transition or to work on the Company s continuing operations, disruption of its ongoing businesses, higher than anticipated costs, adverse impacts to its relationships with its customers and employees, or a failure to achieve the anticipated benefits and/or cost savings. If difficulties with diversifying the Company s loan portfolio are encountered, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. The process of diversifying the Company s loan portfolio will also divert management attention and resources, and could have an adverse effect on the Company s ability to operate efficiently as well as its results of operations and financial condition during the transition period and beyond. 
 
 The process of effecting the run off or sale of non-strategic or other assets of the Company could also result in substantial disruption of the Company's business and operations for similar reasons as stated above. Further, for any sales or divestitures of assets, the Company s ability to effect such divestiture or sale will depend upon various factors, such as the Company s ability to identify interested counterparties, counterparties willingness to negotiate and enter into transactions with the Company, the potential of required regulatory approvals associated with such divestitures, and the prices and other terms upon which any counterparty would be willing to transact with the Company. No assurances can be made that the Company will be able to enter into or complete any sale or divestiture of any assets or that the failure to do so may have a negative impact on the Company s business, operations, liquidity and financial condition. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Shares Repurchased Pursuant to the Company s Stock-Based Incentive Plans 
 
 Participants in the Company s stock-based incentive plans may have shares of common stock withheld to fulfill the income tax obligations that arise in connection with the vesting of their stock awards. Shares that are withheld for this purpose are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the applicable stock-based incentive plan, rather than pursuant to the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors, described below. 
 
 Shares Repurchased Pursuant to the Board of Directors Share Repurchase Authorization 
 
 On October 23, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of the Company s common stock. Under said authorization, shares may be repurchased on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
