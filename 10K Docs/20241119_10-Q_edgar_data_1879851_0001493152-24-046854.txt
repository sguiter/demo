 Notes
to the UNAUDITED CONDENSED consolidated financial statementS 

. The Company was formed for the purpose
of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with
one or more businesses. 

The
Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a business combination. The Company is an early
stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth
companies. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity from July 6, 2021 (inception) through September 30,
2024 relates to the Company s formation, the Initial Public Offering IPO and post-offering activities in search
for a target to consummate a business combination, which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until
after the completion of an initial business combination, at the earliest. The Company generated non-operating income in the form of interest
income from the proceeds derived from the IPO. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

The
Company s ability to commence operations is dependent upon financial resources obtained through an IPO of units on March
27, 2023 (the Units and, with respect to the ordinary share included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares at per Unit, which is discussed in Note 3, and the sale of Units (the Private Placement Units at a price
of per Private Placement Unit in private placements to 2TM Holding LP (the Sponsor that was closed simultaneously
with the IPO (see Note 4). 

The
Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of IPO to purchase up to additional Units to cover over-allotments,
if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On March 30, 2023, ordinary shares stand forfeited
as the overallotment option was not exercised. 

The
underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of per Unit, or in the aggregate, which was paid upon the
closing of the IPO. 

The
Trust Account 

Following
the closing of the IPO, an aggregate of of the net proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units was
deposited in a trust account (the Trust Account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth
in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that
holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment
Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution
of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s shareholders, as described below. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
registration statement for the Company s IPO was declared effective on March 27, 2023. On March 30, 2023, the Company consummated
the IPO of Public Units ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of which is described in
Note 3. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement of units (the Private Placement Units at a price of per Placement Unit in a private placement to the Sponsor generating gross proceeds of which is described
in Note 4 and 5. 

Transaction
costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees and of other offering costs. 

As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had 
and in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of and , respectively.
The Company expects that it will need additional capital to satisfy its liquidity needs beyond the net proceeds from the
consummation of the IPO and the proceeds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and
evaluating prospective business combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel
expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Initial
Business Combination. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the
Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management believes that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period and such period is not extended, there will be a liquidation and subsequent dissolution. As a result,
management has determined that such additional condition also raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern.

Sub ). The A R Merger Agreement amends and restates the Merger Agreement. The A R Merger Agreement was entered into to

Prior to the effective time (the Effective Time of the Merger, Elong will effect a share cancellation of Elong Class
A Ordinary Shares and Elong Class B Ordinary Shares (together, Elong Ordinary Shares ), such that, immediately thereafter,

MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

 FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

References
to the Company, our, us or we refer to TMT Acquisition Corp. The following discussion
and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth
below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
as a result of many factors. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 

We
intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private
placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business combination, our shares, debt or
a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

Results
of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception to September 30, 2024,
have been organizational activities and those necessary to consummate the Initial Public Offering IPO and activities
for the initial business combination, described below. Following our IPO, we will not generate any operating revenues until the completion
of our initial business combination. We generated non-operating income in the form of interest income after the IPO. We expect to incur
increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well
as for due diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 493,852, which consists of income from trust of 863,959 being net
off by loss of 340,107 derived from formation and operating costs and of 30,000 derived from administrative fees. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 1,251,902, which consists of income from trust of 2,259,388 being
net off by loss of 917,486 derived from formation and operating costs and of 90,000 derived from administrative fees. 

3 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 685,420, which consists of income from trust of 804,420 being net
off by loss of 89,000 derived from formation and operating costs and 30,000 derived from administrative fees. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 1,056,943, which consists of income from trust of 1,406,946 being
net off by loss of 280,003 derived from formation and operating costs and 70,000 derived from administrative fees. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
March 30, 2023, we consummated our IPO of 6,000,000 units (the Units ), at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of
 60,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of 370,000 Private Placement Units at a price of 10.00
per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating total gross proceeds of 3,700,000. 

Transaction
costs amounted to 3,868,701 consisting of 1,200,000 of underwriting discount and 2,668,701 of other offering costs. 

Following
the closing of our IPO, an aggregate of 61,200,000 10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds and the sale of the Private Placement
Units was held in a Trust Account Trust Account ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had marketable
securities held in the Trust Account of 67,059,866 and 63,460,478, respectively, consisting of securities held in a treasury trust
fund that invests in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes with a maturity of 180 days or less. We intend to use
substantially the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less
amounts released to us for taxes payable) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes, if
any. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the
Trust Account. We expect the interest income earned on the amount in the Trust Account (if any) will be sufficient to pay our taxes.
Through September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not withdraw any income earned on the Trust Account to pay our taxes, respectively. To the extent that our
equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds
held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other
acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a cash balance of 89,180 and 46,778 and a working capital deficit of
 2,650,198 and 302,711, respectively. The Company expects that it will need additional capital to satisfy its liquidity needs beyond the net proceeds from
the consummation of the IPO and the proceeds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and
evaluating prospective business combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel
expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Initial
Business Combination. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the
Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , management believes that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period and such period is not extended, there will be a liquidation and subsequent dissolution. As a result,
management has determined that such additional condition also raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

4 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our founders or an affiliate of our founders may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial
business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use
a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would
be used for such repayment. Up to 1,800,000 of such loans may be convertible into working capital units, at a price of 10.00 per unit
at the option of the lender. The working capital units would be identical to the private units, each consisting of one ordinary share
and one right with the same exercise price, exercisability and exercise period, subject to similar limited restrictions as compared to
the units sold in our IPO. The terms of such loans by our founders or their affiliates, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

Pursuant
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination
up to three times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination) without submitting
such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection therewith.
In order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees,
upon ten days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account 600,000 0.10 per share) on or prior
to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension (or up to an aggregate of 1,800,000, or 0.30 per share if we
extend for the full nine months). Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loans will be non-interest bearing
and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. If we do not complete a business combination, we will not
repay such loans. 

On
December 1, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), by and among the Company,
TMT Merger Sub, Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and eLong Power Holding Limited,
a Cayman Islands exempted company Elong ). Pursuant to such a merger agreement, the corporate existence of TMT Merger Sub
will cease. Upon consummation of the Merger (the Closing ), among other things, the Company will acquire all outstanding
equity interests in Elong in exchange for ordinary shares of the Company with a value of 450,000,000 (based on an assumed value of 10.00

A Ordinary Shares and Company s Class B Ordinary (the Initial Consideration ), respectively, less the number of Company s
Class A Ordinary Shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of the Assumed Warrants (as defined below), allocated among Elong s
shareholders on a pro rata basis. 

On
February 29, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the A R Merger Agreement ),
by and among the Company, Elong and ELong Power Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Elong Merger
Sub ). The A R Merger Agreement amends and restates the Merger Agreement. The A R Merger Agreement was entered into to
modify the structure of the Merger as described below, while the overall economic terms of the business combination contained in the
Merger Agreement remain unchanged. 

Prior to the effective time (the Effective Time of the Merger, Elong will effect a share cancellation of Elong Class
A Ordinary Shares and Elong Class B Ordinary Shares (together, Elong Ordinary Shares ), such that, immediately thereafter,
Elong will have forty-five million (45,000,000) Elong Ordinary Shares, issued and outstanding, comprising thirty-nine million four hundred
and seventeen thousand and seventy-eight (39,417,078) Elong Class A Ordinary Shares and five million five hundred and eighty-two thousand
nine hundred and twenty-two (5,582,922) Elong Class B Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding, less the number of shares reserved for
issuance upon exercise of the Elong Warrants. The ratio of the reverse share split is based on a valuation of Elong of four hundred and
fifty million U.S. Dollars 450,000,000).

at their election, convert the note, in whole or in part, into the Company s units, provided that written notice of such intention
is given to the Company at least two (2) business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. The number of units to
be received by the note payee in connection with such conversion shall be an amount determined by dividing (x) the sum of the outstanding
principal amount payable to such payee by (y) 10.00. Each unit consists of one (1) ordinary share and one (1) right to receive two-tenths
(2/10) of one (1) ordinary share. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 1,965,000 and 0 is outstanding in total under the convertible notes, respectively. Among
all the convertible notes, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 1,190,000 and 0 is outstanding under the convertible notes
issued to related party, and 775,000 and 0 is outstanding under the convertible notes issued to Elong, respectively. Refer to Note
2 - Organization and Business Operations section of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for details. 

On
October 23, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note with no interest, with the principal amount of 140,000 to Ms.
Xiaozhen Li Convertible Note 10 ). Refer to Note 9 Subsequent Events section of the notes to the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements for details. 

Accordingly,
the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates
continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Further,
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Management plans
to address this uncertainty during period leading up to the initial business combination. The Company cannot provide any assurance that
its plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial business combination will be successful. Based on the foregoing, management believes
that the Company lacks the financial resources it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time. Moreover, management s
plans to consummate the initial business combination may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Party Transactions 

Please
refer to Note 5 - Related Parties section of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have
not identified any critical accounting estimates. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06,
Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates
the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies
the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard
also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s
own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for
all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within
those fiscal year for smaller reporting companies. The Company adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2024. The Company has issued convertible
notes in 2024, and it did not have any convertible notes before January 1, 2024. There was no impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements after this adoption. 

On November 4, 2024, FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense
Disaggregation Disclosure (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires public business entities PBEs to disclose, in interim and annual reporting periods, additional information about certain expenses in the notes to financial statements.
ASU 2024-03 will begin effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted as well. The Company assessed the impact of ASU 2024-03 and does not believe that
such amendments would have an impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements or future financials. 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 6 for commitments and contingencies. We do not participate in transactions that
create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or
purchased any non-financial assets. The Company has obligations towards the loans raised in the form of convertible notes from the
Sponsor and unrelated party. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements
for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are
electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective
dates. 

Additionally,
we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions,
we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over
financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth
public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted
by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about
the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items
such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee
compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an
 emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024, respectively, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the
consummation of our IPO, the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement units held in the trust account have
invested in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the
short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024.
Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective, due solely to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the
Company s lack of qualified SEC reporting professional. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to
ensure that our condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Accordingly, management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q
present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented.
Management intends to continue implement remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal
control over financial reporting. Specifically, we intend to expand and improve our review process for complex securities and
related accounting standards. We have improved this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of
third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with
the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
