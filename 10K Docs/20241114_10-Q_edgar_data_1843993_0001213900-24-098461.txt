Note 3). 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of units (the Private Placement
Units at a price of per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to TBCP IV, LLC (the Sponsor ),
generating gross proceeds of (the Private Placement (see Note 4). The Private Placement Units consist
of share of Class A Common Stock (the Private Placement Shares ), and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant
(the Private Placement Warrants and together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants ). Each whole Private
Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of per

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on July 2, 2021, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds
of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Units in the Private Placement was placed in an U.S.-based
trust account Trust Account ), which were initially invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth
in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of
185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting
the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company. To mitigate the risk that the Company might
be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, on June 22, 2023, the Company instructed Continental Stock
Transfer Trust Company Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account, as of July 1, 2023,
and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A,
with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution
of the Trust Account to the Company s stockholders, as described below.

with the Over-Allotment, the Company consummated a sale of an additional Private Placement Units to the Sponsor at a
price of per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of . Following the Over-Allotment, an additional of
proceeds was placed in the Trust Account. In connection with the partial exercise of the over-allotment option and the expiration of
the over-allotment option, shares of the Class B Common Stock were forfeited for no consideration. 

The
Company s executive officers and directors Management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application
of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended
to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq provide
that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 
of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account)
at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination
if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

The
Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting
called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the
Company may seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which Public Stockholders may
seek to redeem their Public Shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with
a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least either immediately prior to or upon such consummation
of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor
of the Business Combination. 

If
the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules,
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company currently in effect, as amended (the Amended and Restated
Charter ), provides that, a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such
stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to or more of the
Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

The
Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account 
per share, as of September 30, 2024, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released
to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Stockholders who redeem their Public Shares
will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering
(see Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Warrants. These shares
of Class A Common Stock have been recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial
Public Offering, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). 

If
a stockholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the
Company will, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Charter, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and
file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior
to completing a Business Combination.

per
Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account,
if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets, less taxes payable, provided that such
liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to
monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s
indemnity of the underwriters of Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification
obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations
and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its stockholders
that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company
for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek
to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have
all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements
with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

The
Company completed its Initial Public Offering, at which time, capital in excess of the funds deposited in the Trust Account and/or used
to fund offering expenses was released to the Company for general working capital purposes. Additionally, the Sponsor executed the (i)
WCL Promissory Note (as defined in Note 5) and (ii) 2024 Promissory Note (as defined in Note 5) to loan the Company up to 
and , respectively. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowed and repaid under the WCL Promissory
Note. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowed approximately under the 2024 Promissory Note,
and approximately remained available to finance transaction costs in connection with the initial Business Combination. 

Extensions
of the Combination Period 

The
Company initially had until July 2, 2023, 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, to consummate its initial
Business Combination (the Combination Period ). On June 21, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders
in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders (the 2023 Special Meeting at which its stockholders approved, among
other things, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Charter to (i) extend the Combination Period from July 2, 2023 to July 2, 2024
(or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors (the Board of Directors )) (the First
Extension Amendment Proposal and (ii) provide for the right of a holder of shares of Class B Common Stock, to convert such
shares into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of a Business Combination (the Founder

(the 2023 Redemptions ), for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately million. The 2023 Redemptions were
effected on July 3, 2023. 

On
June 26, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders (the 2024 Special
Meeting at which its stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Charter to extend
the Combination Period from July 2, 2024 to January 2, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the Board of Directors) (the Second
Extension Amendment Proposal ). 

In
connection with the 2024 Special Meeting and the vote to approve the Second Extension Amendment Proposal, Public Stockholders holding
 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem such Public Shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 
per share (the 2024 Redemptions ), for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately million. The 2024 Redemptions
were effected on July 2, 2024. 

As
a result of the Founder Share Conversion (as defined in Note 5), the 2023 Redemptions and the 2024 Redemptions, as of September 30, 2024,
there were shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding. (See Note 2). 

If
the Company has not completed a Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Charter,
the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than
ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on
deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company
to pay taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares,
which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further
liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Board of Directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby
a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. The underwriters of the Initial Public Offering have agreed
to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a
Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust
Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the
per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ). 

Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 

On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for,
among other things, a new U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations
and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023 (the Excise
Tax ). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased.
The amount of the Excise Tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However,
for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock
issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the
Excise Tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other
guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the Excise Tax. In April 2024, the Treasury issued proposed regulations
providing guidance with respect to the Excise Tax. Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Under the proposed regulations, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax.
In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year as a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax.

In
connection with the 2023 Special Meeting and the vote to approve the Charter Amendment Proposals, Public Stockholders exercised their
right to redeem Public Shares for a total of approximately million. In connection with the 2024 Special Meeting
and the vote to approve the Second Extension Amendment Proposal, Public Stockholders exercised their right to redeem Public
Shares for a total of approximately million. 

The
Excise Tax should be recognized in the period incurred, that is when the repurchase occurs. Any reduction in the tax liability due to
a subsequent stock issuance, or an event giving rise to an exception, that occurs within a tax year should be recorded in the period
of such stock issuance or event giving rise to an exception. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded

Nasdaq
Notice 

On
October 24, 2023, the Company received a letter (the Total Stockholders Notice from the Listing Qualifications
Department of Nasdaq (the Nasdaq Staff notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2),
which requires the Company to maintain at least total holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market (the Total

to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to
the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless
basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance
of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption
from registration is available. 

The
Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of the Business Combination,
it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC, and within 60 business days following the Business Combination to have declared effective,
a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and to maintain
a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A Common Stock until the Warrants expire or are redeemed. If a registration statement
covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is not effective by the 60 th business
day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement
and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise Warrants on a cashless

the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 

The
Warrant Agreement contains an Alternative Issuance provision that if less than of the consideration receivable by the holders
of the Class A Common Stock in the Business Combination is payable in the form of common equity in the successor entity, and if the holders
of the warrants properly exercise the Warrants within thirty days following the public disclosure of the consummation of Business Combination

price in effect prior to such reduction minus (ii) (A) the Per Share Consideration (as defined below) minus (B) the Black-Scholes Warrant
Value (as defined below). The Black-Scholes Warrant Value means the value of a warrant immediately prior to the consummation
of the Business Combination based on the Black-Scholes Warrant Model for a Capped American Call on Bloomberg Financial Markets. Per
Share Consideration means (i) if the consideration paid to holders of the Common Stock consists exclusively of cash, the amount
of such cash per Common Stock, and (ii) in all other cases, the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as reported during

and , respectively, and (ii) Private Placement Warrants outstanding with a fair value of and ,
respectively. 

The
Company accounts for the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants issued and outstanding
in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the Warrants do not meet the criteria for
equity treatment thereunder, each Warrant must be recorded as a derivative liability. 

The
Company believes that the adjustments to the exercise price of the Warrants is based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value
of a fixed-for-fixed option as defined under ASC 815 40, and thus the Warrants are not eligible for an exception
from derivative accounting. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record a derivative
liability upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. Accordingly, the Company classifies each Warrant as a liability at its fair
value and the Warrants have been allocated a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Units equal to its fair value determined
by the Monte Carlo simulation. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such remeasurement,
the Warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the accompanying unaudited condensed
statements of operations. The Company will reassess the classification at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a
result of events during the period, the Warrants will be reclassified as of the date of the event that causes the reclassification.

30, 2024 (this Report including, without limitation, statements under this Item regarding our financial position, business
strategy and the plans and objectives of Management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Report,
words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and
similar expressions, as they relate to us or our Management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are
based on the beliefs of our Management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our Management. Actual
results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in
our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a Business Combination. We intend
to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement,
the proceeds of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial Business Combination (pursuant to any backstop agreements we
may enter into), our shares, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

The
issuance of additional shares in connection with an initial Business Combination to the owners of the target or other investors: 

may significantly
 dilute the equity interest of holders of our Common Stock; 

may subordinate the rights
 of holders of our Common Stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our Common Stock; 

could cause a change in
 control if a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use
 our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of
 delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control
 of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing
 market prices for our Units, Public Shares and/or Public Warrants. 

Similarly,
if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in: 

default and foreclosure
 on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations
 to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require
 the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of
 all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain
 necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the
 debt security is outstanding; 

25 

our inability to pay dividends
 on our Common Stock; 

using a substantial portion
 of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Common Stock
 if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility
 in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability
 to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations on our ability
 to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy;
 and 

other purposes and other
 disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

The
SEC has adopted new rules and regulations relating to SPACs, which became effective on July 1, 2024. The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among
other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC sponsors and related persons; (ii) additional disclosures relating to SPAC
Business Combination transactions (iii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors
and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iv) additional disclosures regarding
projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions and (v) the requirement that
both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s
adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company
Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance
of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may
increase the costs and time related thereto. 

Recent
Developments 

On
September 11, 2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel determined to grant our request to continue our listing on Nasdaq, subject to the following:
on or before January 14, 2025, we will complete the Coincheck Business Combination and demonstrate compliance with the 36-Month Rule
and all applicable initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Nasdaq Hearings Panel advised us that January 14, 2025,
represents the full extent of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel s discretion to grant continued listing while we are non-compliant with
the 36-Month Rule. 

During
the Exception Period, we must provide prompt notification of any significant events occurring that may affect compliance with Nasdaq
requirements, including, but not limited to, any event calling into question our ability to meet the terms of the granted exception.
The Nasdaq Hearings Panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of the granted exception based on any event, condition or circumstance
that exists or develops that would make continued listing of our securities inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of the Nasdaq Hearings
Panel. Any compliance document will also be subject to review by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel during the Exception Period, and the Nasdaq
Hearings Panel reserves the right to request additional information before determining compliance by us with the terms of the exception. 

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to, on or before January 14, 2025, (i) complete the Coincheck Business Combination, (ii) demonstrate
compliance with the 36-Month Rule and all applicable initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market and (iii) maintain compliance
with other Nasdaq listing requirements within the Exception Period. 

On October
8, 2024, the Coincheck Business Combination Parties entered into the Third BCA Amendment to delete the Sponsor s and Company Shareholders 
right to receive Sponsor Earn Out Shares and Company Shareholder Earn Out Shares, respectively (as defined in the Coincheck Business Combination
Agreement). Further, at the Closing, the Sponsor shall automatically forfeit and surrender, and PubCo shall repurchase for no consideration,
2,365,278 of the PubCo Ordinary Shares to be delivered to the Sponsor. 

On November 12, 2024, a registration statement on Form F-4 in connection with the Coincheck Business Combination was declared effective
by the SEC and we filed and mailed a definitive proxy statement/prospectus to seek stockholder approval of the Coincheck Business Combination
at a special meeting of stockholders to be held on December 5, 2024. 

26 

Coincheck
Business Combination 

On
March 22, 2022, we entered into the Coincheck Business Combination Agreement, b y and among the
Coincheck Business Combination Parties, as amended on May 31, 2023, May 28, 2024 and October 8, 2024. The Coincheck Business
Combination Agreement was unanimously approved by our Board of Directors. If the Coincheck Business Combination Agreement is
approved by our stockholders, and the Coincheck Business Combination is consummated, (i) Coincheck equity holders will conduct a
share exchange pursuant to which they will receive shares of PubCo and Coincheck will become a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo and
(ii) we will merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, with our Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, with our stockholders and warrant holders, receiving identical numbers of securities of
PubCo. 

For
a full description of the Coincheck Business Combination Agreement and the proposed Coincheck Business Combination, please see Item
1. Business of our 2023 Annual Report. 

Extensions
of Our Combination Period 

We
initially had until July 2, 2023, 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, to consummate our initial Business Combination.
On June 21, 2023, we held the 2023 Special Meeting at which our stockholders approved, among other things, the Charter Amendment Proposals.
In connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment Proposals, the holders of 20,135,697 shares of Class A Common Stock
properly exercised their right to redeem their Public Shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.28 per share, for an
aggregate redemption amount of approximately 207.1 million in the 2023 Redemptions. The 2023 Redemptions were effected on July
3, 2023. On June 26, 2024, we held the 2024 Special Meeting at which our stockholders approved, among other things, the Second Extension
Amendment Proposal. 

In
connection with the 2024 Special Meeting and the vote to approve the Second Extension Amendment Proposal, Public Stockholders holding
592,601 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem such Public Shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.64
per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 6.3 million. The 2024 Redemptions were effected on July 2, 2024. 

Founder
Share Conversion 

On June
29, 2023, following the approval by our stockholders of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal at the 2023 Special Meeting, we issued an
aggregate of 5,913,195 shares of Class A Common Stock to the Sponsor, upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B Common
Stock held by the Sponsor in the Founder Share Conversion. The 5,913,195 shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection
with the Founder Share Conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B Common Stock before the Founder Share
Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor
of an initial Business Combination as described in the IPO Registration Statement; consequently, the shares of Class A Common Stock issued
in connection with the Founder Share Conversion are not registered under the Securities Act and will remain unregistered until registration
is demanded by the Sponsor. 

Following
the Founder Share Conversion, the 2023 Redemptions and the 2024 Redemptions, (i) there were 9,485,736 shares of Class A Common Stock
and one share of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding and (ii) the Sponsor held approximately 69.1 of the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock as of September 30, 2024. 

Nasdaq
Notice 

On
October 24, 2023, we received the Total Stockholders Notice from the Nasdaq Staff notifying us that we were not in compliance
with the Total Stockholders Rule. The Total Stockholders Notice stated that we had until December 8, 2023 to provide Nasdaq with a plan
to regain compliance. If the plan was accepted, Nasdaq Staff may grant an extension of up to 180
calendar days from the date of the Total Stockholders Notice to evidence compliance. If Nasdaq Staff did not accept our plan, we would
have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. The Total Stockholders Notice had no immediate effect
on the listing of our securities, and our securities continued to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market. 

27 

On
October 26, 2023, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose our receipt of the Total Stockholders Notice in accordance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5810(b). 

On
December 8, 2023, we submitted our plan to meet the requirements under the Total Stockholders Rule. On December 13, 2023, we received
a letter from the Nasdaq Staff granting us until April 22, 2024 to file documentation with the Nasdaq Staff from our transfer agent,
or independent source, that demonstrates that our Common Stock has a minimum of 400 total holders. We submitted such documentation to
the Nasdaq Staff on April 17, 2024. 

On
April 26, 2024, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Staff (i) confirming receipt of the submitted documentation, (ii) determining that
we are in compliance with the Total Stockholders Rule and (iii) declaring the matter now closed. 

On
July 18, 2024, we received the 36-Month Notice from the Nasdaq Staff indicating that unless we timely request a hearing before the Nasdaq
Hearings Panel, trading of our securities on Nasdaq would be suspended due to our non-compliance with the 36-Month Rule, which requires
that a SPAC complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration
statement. We timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the 36-Month Notice. On July 25, 2024, Nasdaq granted
our hearing request, which stayed the suspension of trading of our securities on Nasdaq until the hearing process concluded and the Nasdaq
Hearings Panel issued a written decision. We attended the hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel on August 22, 2024. On September 11,
2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel determined to grant the Company s request to continue its listing on Nasdaq, subject to the Company
complying with certain requirements on or before January 14, 2025. 

Results
of Operations 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net income of 122,259 and 205,799, respectively. The net income consisted
of formation and operating costs of 308,884 and 134,002, interest income of 325,781 and 376,608, income from the change in fair value
of our Warrant liability of 195,703 and 390,110 and a provision of income taxes of 90,341 and 426,917, respectively. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net income (loss) of (228,570) and 4,131,687 respectively. The net income
(loss) consisted of formation and operating costs of 880,026 and 849,809, interest income of 1,100,321 and 5,769,361, income (loss)
from the change in fair value of our Warrant liability of (243,008) and 390,110 and a provision of income taxes of 205,857 and 1,177,975,
respectively. 

Since
the consummation of our Initial Public Offering through September 30, 2024, our activity has been limited to the evaluation of potential
initial Business Combination candidates, and consummating the initial Business Combination, and we will not be generating any operating
revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We are incurring increased expenses as a result of being
a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

Factors
That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in
interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical
instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more
of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete
an initial Business Combination.

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
indicated in the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1. Financial Statements ,
we had 196 held outside of the Trust Account that is available to us to fund our working capital requirements and approximately 31,467,808
held inside the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024. 

Prior
to the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, our only sources of liquidity were an initial purchase of Founder Shares for 25,000
by the Sponsor, and a total of 105,000 of loans and advances by the Sponsor. 

On
July 2, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering in which we sold 22,500,000 Units at a price of 10.00 per Unit generating gross
proceeds of 225,000,000 before underwriting fees and expenses. Simultaneously with the consummation of our Initial Public Offering,
we consummated the Private Placement of 625,000 Private Placement Units, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of 6,250,000. Each
Private Placement Unit consists of one Public Share and one-fifth of one Public Warrant. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder
to purchase one Public Share at an exercise price of 11.50 per whole share. 

On
August 9, 2021, the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering exercised the over-allotment option in part and purchased an additional 1,152,784 Over-Allotment
Units, generating gross proceeds of 11,527,840 and consummated a sale of an additional 23,055 Private Placement Units to the Sponsor
at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of 230,550. Following the Over-Allotment, an additional
 11,527,840 of proceeds was placed in the Trust Account. In connection with the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, 555,554
shares of Class B Common Stock were forfeited for no consideration. 

In
connection with our Initial Public Offering and the Over-Allotment, we incurred offering costs of 12,793,700 (including an underwriting
fee of 4,730,557 and deferred underwriting commissions of 8,278,474). Other incurred offering costs consisted principally of formation
and preparation fees related to our Initial Public Offering. A total of 236,527,840, comprised of 231,797,283 of the proceeds from
the Initial Public Offering and the underwriters exercise of the over-allotment option and 4,730,557 of the proceeds of the Private
Placement, was placed in the Trust Account, established for the benefit of our Public Stockholders. 

On
June 22, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account as of July 1, 2023, and instead
to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental continuing
to act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, at September
30, 2024, the assets held in the Trust Account were invested in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank and are no longer
invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. 

On
March 25, 2022, the Sponsor executed the WCL Promissory Note, representing a Working Capital Loan from the Sponsor to us, of up to 1,500,000.
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 896,000 and 781,000 outstanding under the WCL Promissory Note, respectively,
and 0 and 115,000 remained available to finance transaction costs in connection with the initial Business Combination. Through September
30, 2024, we had borrowed 1,500,000 and repaid 604,000 of the total advanced. 

On
March 28, 2024, we issued the 2024 Promissory Note to the Sponsor in the principal amount of up to 1,000,000. The 2024 Promissory Note
bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (i) the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination,
and (ii) the date of our liquidation. On May 15, 2024, we amended and restated the 2024 Promissory Note to increase the principal amount
from up to 1,000,000 to up to 2,000,000. The rest of the terms of the 2024 Promissory Note remain the same. At September 30, 2024,
there was approximately 1,131,529 outstanding under the 2024 Promissory Note and approximately 868,000 remained available to borrow
under the 2024 Promissory Note. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of approximately 6,511,000, including approximately 200 in our operating bank
account. 

29 

Our
liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through (i) a contribution of 25,000 from the Sponsor to cover certain expenses in
exchange for the issuance of the Founder Shares, (ii) an advance from an affiliate of the Sponsor of the payment of certain formation
and operating costs on our behalf, (iii) the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account and
(iv) borrowings under the WCL Promissory Note and the 2024 Promissory Note. 

In
connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASC 205-40, we have evaluated our liquidity and financial
condition and determined that it is probable we will not be able to meet our obligations over the period of one year from the issuance
date of the unaudited condensed financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements . In addition, while our plans
to seek additional funding or to consummate an initial Business Combination, there is no guarantee we will be able to borrow such funds
from our Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors in order to meet our obligations through the
earlier of the consummation of an initial Business Combination or one year from this filing. We have determined that the uncertainty
surrounding our liquidity condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed
financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

Contractual
Obligations 

At
September 30, 2024, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities
other than the Warrant liability of 633,118. 

Underwriting
Agreement 

The underwriters
of the Initial Public Offering were paid a cash underwriting fee of 2 of gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the over-allotment
option, or 4,730,557. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to aggregate deferred underwriting commissions of 8,278,474, consisting
of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering. The deferred underwriting commissions will become payable to the underwriters
from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete an initial Business Combination, subject to the terms
of the Underwriting Agreement. 

On
July 29, 2024, the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held
in the Trust Account in the event we do not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, pursuant to the Underwriting
Agreement, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to
fund the redemption of the Public Shares in the event of our liquidation (as described elsewhere in this Report). 

Administrative
Services Agreement 

We
have entered into the Administrative Services Agreement with First Capital, an affiliate of our Sponsor, pursuant to which we pay a total
of 10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services to such affiliate. Upon completion of our initial Business
Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Accordingly, in the event the consummation of our initial Business
Combination takes the maximum 42 months, an affiliate of our Sponsor will be paid a total of 420,000 10,000 per month) for office
space, administrative and support services. Under the Administrative Services Agreement, we had incurred 30,000 and 30,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 90,000 and 90,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Administrative Service fees included in accrued expenses were 190,000 and 110,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Advisory
Agreement 

We
have entered into the Advisory Agreement with an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which we pay a total of 20,000
per month for advisory services relating to our search for and consummation of an initial Business Combination. Upon completion of our
initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Accordingly, in the event the consummation
of our initial Business Combination takes the maximum 42 months, an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer will be paid a total of
 840,000 20,000 per month) for such advisory services and will be entitled to be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses. Under the
Advisory Agreement, we had incurred 60,000 and 60,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 180,000
and 180,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Advisory Agreement fees included in accrued expenses
were 320,000 and 180,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

30 

Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires our Management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could
materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies: 

Liquidity
and Going Concern Consideration 

In
connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASC 205-40, we have until January 2, 2025 to consummate
a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If we do not complete
our Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as
promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the Common Stock sold as part of the Units
in the Initial Public Offering, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account,
including interest (which interest shall be net of franchise and income taxes payable and less up to 100,000 of such net interest which
may be distributed to us to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will
completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
our remaining stockholders and the Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under the DGCL
to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

In
the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including
Trust Account assets) will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit in the Initial Public Offering. In addition, if we
fail to complete our Business Combination within the Combination Period, there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions
with respect to the Warrants, which will expire worthless. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation,
should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate
after January 2, 2025. The amount of time remaining to finalize a Business Combination does raise substantial doubt in our Company as
a going concern. 

In
addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had current liabilities of 6,538,470and 5,977,615, respectively, and working
capital (deficit) of (6,510,523) and (5,959,611), respectively. These amounts include accrued expenses owed to professionals, consultants,
advisors and others who are working on seeking a Business Combination. Such work is continuing after September 30, 2024 and amounts are
continuing to accrue. In order to finance ongoing operating costs, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor may provide us with additional
working capital via the 2024 Promissory Note. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment Proposals and the 2023 Redemptions, and during 2023, we received 1,565,444
from Continental, the Trustee of the Trust Account, from the excess interest in the Trust Account, pursuant to our letter of instructions
requesting a withdrawal sufficient to meet any potential estimated tax obligations. In connection with the vote to approve the Second
Extension Amendment Proposal and the 2024 Redemptions, we received 518,050 from Continental, from the excess interest in the Trust Account,
pursuant to our letter of instructions requesting a withdrawal sufficient to meet any potential estimated tax obligations. We anticipate
continuing to make payments on our operating expenses, including taxes as they become due and payable through a combination of cash held
on the balance sheet and advances from the WCL Promissory Note and 2024 Promissory Note. We estimate as of September 30, 2024, income
taxes payable of 330,970. As of September 30, 2024, our cash balances are insufficient to pay our estimated income tax obligation. The
Sponsor has advised us that it is prepared to honor advances to meet our income tax obligations, less any cash held on our balance sheet,
as they become due. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made payments for operating expenses, including taxes, as well as other expenses and obligations. 

31 

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and
stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended
transition period. which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private
companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised
standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth
company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of
the potential differences in accounting standards used. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a
material effect on the unaudited condensed financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

32 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. The material weakness was due to an ineffective control environment surrounding
the lack of effectively designed controls to properly evaluate and assess certain period end expense accruals. Such ineffective control
environment led to a misstatement that was corrected prior to the issuance of the financial statements contained in the 2023 Annual Report.
This deficiency represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 because it created
a possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements might not be detected or prevented on a timely basis. 

In
light of this material weakness, we have enhanced our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements
to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements including making
greater use of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation
plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.
We believe our efforts will enhance our controls relating to accounting for complex financial transactions, but we can offer no assurance
that our controls will not require additional review and modification in the future as industry accounting practice may evolve over time. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended
September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

To
the knowledge of our Management, there is no material litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or
directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company
under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. For
additional risks relating to our operations, other than as set forth below, see the section titled Risk Factors contained
in our (i) IPO Registration Statement, (ii) Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, as filed
with the SEC on March 30, 2022 and March 31, 2023, respectively, (iii) 2023 Annual Report, (iv) Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023
and September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022, July 27, 2022, November 14, 2022, May 15, 2023, August 18, 2023 and November
14, 2023, respectively, and (v) Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as filed with the SEC on June 11, 2024 . Any of these
factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks
could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such
risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

For risks
related to Coincheck and the Coincheck Business Combination, please see the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on November
12, 2024. 

Our
securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq and delisted if we do not (i) complete the Coincheck Business Combination and (ii)
demonstrate compliance with the 36-Month Rule and all applicable initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market within the Exception
Period. Any trading suspension or delisting could have a material adverse effect on the trading of our securities and may adversely affect
our ability to consummate an initial Business Combination. 

On
September 11, 2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel determined to grant our request to continue our listing on Nasdaq, subject to the following:
on or before January 14, 2025, we will complete the Coincheck Business Combination and demonstrate compliance with the 36-Month Rule
and all applicable initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Nasdaq Hearings Panel advised us that January 14, 2025,
represents the full extent of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel s discretion to grant continued listing while we are non-compliant with
the 36-Month Rule. 

During
the Exception Period, we must provide prompt notification of any significant events occurring that may affect compliance with Nasdaq
requirements, including, but not limited to, any event calling into question our ability to meet the terms of the granted exception.
The Nasdaq Hearings Panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of the granted exception based on any event, condition or circumstance
that exists or develops that would make continued listing of our securities inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of the Nasdaq Hearings
Panel. Any compliance document will also be subject to review by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel during the Exception Period, and the Nasdaq
Hearings Panel reserves the right to request additional information before determining compliance by us with the terms of the exception. 

Under
the previous Nasdaq rule, a SPAC not in compliance with the 36-Month Requirement could request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearing Panel,
which would have the effect of staying any potential delisting. However, in rules that became effective on October 7, 2024 (the New
Nasdaq Rules ), which includes removing the stay relating to the 36-Month Rule. Under the New Nasdaq Rules, a SPAC s Nasdaq-listed
securities will be immediately suspended from trading through the pendency of the Nasdaq Hearing Panel s review. In addition, the
scope of the Nasdaq Hearing Panel s review is limited, as the Nasdaq Hearing Panel may only reverse a delisting determination by
the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (a Staff Delisting Determination where it determines that
the Staff Delisting Determination was made in error and that the SPAC never failed to satisfy the 36-Month Rule. In such cases, the Nasdaq
Hearing Panel is no longer able to consider facts indicating that the SPAC had regained compliance since the date of the Staff Delisting
Determination, nor may the Nasdaq Hearing Panel grant an exception allowing the SPAC additional time to regain compliance. If a SPAC completes
a Business Combination after receiving a Staff Delisting Determination and/or demonstrates compliance with all applicable initial listing
requirements, the combined company will apply to list its securities on Nasdaq pursuant to the normal application review process. The
New Nasdaq Rules contained a list of deficiencies that would immediately result in a Staff Delisting Determination, which includes noncompliance
with the 36-Month Rule. 

34 

Accordingly,
unless we are able to (i) complete the Coincheck Business Combination on or before January 14, 2025, (ii) demonstrate compliance with
the 36-Month Rule and all applicable initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market and (iii) maintain compliance with other
Nasdaq listing requirements within the Exception Period, our securities will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq and delisted. If Nasdaq
were to suspend our securities from trading and delist our securities, our securities could potentially be quoted on an over-the-counter
market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

appearing
 to be less attractive to potential target companies than an exchange listed SPAC; 

a
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced
 liquidity for our securities; 

a
 determination that our Class A Common Stock is a penny stock, which will require
 brokers trading in our Class A Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly
 result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a
 limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a
 decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

In
addition, if our securities are delisted from Nasdaq, trading in our securities, and offers and sales of our securities by us, may be
subject to state securities regulation and additional compliance costs. 

Our
Public Stockholders exercise of redemption rights with respect to a large number of Public Shares in the 2023 Redemptions and
2024 Redemptions may affect our ability to complete an initial Business Combination in the most desirable manner that will optimize the
capital structure of the combined company, or at all. 

Over
the past two years, the redemption rate of shares held by Public Stockholders of SPACs at the time of a stockholder meeting that approves
an amendment to the charter of the SPAC or the initial Business Combination of the SPAC has been very high, thereby increasing the likelihood
that we, too, may be subject to significant redemptions that may affect our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment Proposals at the 2023 Special Meeting, 20,135,697 Public Shares were redeemed
at a price per Public Share of approximately 10.28. In connection with the vote to approve the Second Extension Amendment Proposal at
the 2024 Special Meeting, 592,601 Public Shares were redeemed at a price per Public Share of approximately 10.64. The 2023 Redemptions
and the 2024 Redemptions reduced the (i) number of total outstanding Public Shares to 2,924,486 (as of September 30, 2024), and (ii)
total amount held in the Trust Account to approximately 31,467,808 (as of September 30, 2024). 

Due
to the high rates of redemptions of Public Shares in connection with stockholder votes on extensions or Business Combinations of SPACs,
we may need to rely upon significant PIPE or other outside financing to provide cash to our post-Business Combination company. Obtaining
financing in connection with initial Business Combinations of SPACs has in recent times been very difficult, with many financings available
only on terms that are onerous to the surviving company of the Business Combination. The failure to secure additional financing on reasonable
terms could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of the Sponsor or our
other stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial Business Combination. Raising additional
third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels or on onerous
terms. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete a Business Combination in the most desirable manner that will optimize
the capital structure of the combined company, or at all. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination, our Public Stockholders
may only receive approximately 10.76 per Public Share on the liquidation of our Trust Account, as of September 30, 2024, and our Warrants
will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our Public Stockholders may receive less than 10.76 per share on the redemption of
their Public Shares.

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

None. 

Use
of Proceeds 

For
a description of the use of proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, see Part II, Item 2 of our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021, as filed with the SEC on August 16, 2021. There has been no material
change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as described in the IPO Registration Statement.
The specific investments in our Trust Account may change from time to time. 

On
June 22, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account as of July 1, 2023, and
instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, with Continental
continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result,
following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and
the Private Placement are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. 

Purchases
of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 

On
June 26, 2024, we held the 2024 Special Meeting and our stockholders approved, among other things, the Second Extension Amendment Proposal,
which extended the date by which we must consummate a Business Combination from July 2, 2024 to January 2, 2025 (or such earlier date
as determined by the Board of Directors). In connection with the 2024 Special Meeting and the vote to approve the Second Extension Amendment
Proposal, Public Stockholders holding 592,601 Public Shares properly exercised
their right to redeem such Public Shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.64 per share, for an aggregate redemption
amount of approximately 6.3 million. The 2024 Redemptions were effected on July 2, 2024.
