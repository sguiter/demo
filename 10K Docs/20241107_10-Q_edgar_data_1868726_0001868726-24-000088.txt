 of the federal, state or local tax cash savings that the Company actually realizes on its taxable income following the IPO, as a result of the amortization of intangible assets and capitalized transaction costs that existed as of the date of the IPO. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, generally the Company will retain the benefit of the remaining of the applicable tax savings. 
 The Tax Receivable Agreement liability is calculated based on current tax laws and the assumption that the Company and its subsidiaries will earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Updates to the Company s blended state tax rate, allocation of U.S. versus foreign sourced income and changes in tax rules on the amortization and depreciation of assets may significantly impact the established liability, and changes to that established liability would be recorded to other income (expense) in the period the Company made the determination regarding the applicable change. The C ompany expects that future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement relating to the Pre-IPO Tax Assets could aggregate to million over the remaining period under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which bega n in the year ended December 31, 2022, are not conditioned upon the parties continued ownership of equity in the Company.

 million. The 2022 Interest Rate Cap expired on July 31, 2024. 
 In advance of the expiration of the 2022 Interest Rate Cap, on May 7, 2024, the Company entered into a second interest rate cap transaction (the 2024 Interest Rate Cap and, together with the 2022 Interest Rate Cap, the Interest Rate Caps in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, with a notional amount of million. The 2024 Interest Rate Cap expires on July 31, 2026. 
 The 2024 Interest Rate Cap asset is, and the 2022 Interest Rate Cap was, measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value the Interest Rate Caps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the Interest Rate Caps utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company has determined that the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to the Interest Rate Caps were not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, the 2024 Interest Rate Cap as of September 30, 2024 and the 2022 Interest Rate Cap as of December 31, 2023 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 (1) As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have outstanding amounts drawn on the 2022 Revolver, including letters of credit and swingline loan sub-facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of available borrowing capacity under the 2022 Revolver. 
 The interest rate on outstanding debt under the 2022 Term Loan Facility was per annum as of September 30, 2024. The interest rates for all facilities under the 2022 Credit Agreement are calculated based upon the Company s election among (a) an adjusted term secured overnight financing rate SOFR (subject to a floor with respect to the 2022 Term Loan Facility, and a floor with respect to the 2022 Revolver) plus an additional interest rate spread, (b) with respect to a borrowing in Euros under the 2022 Revolver, a euro interbank offered rate (subject to a floor) plus an additional interest rate spread, or (c) an Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) (subject to a floor with respect to the 2022 Term Loan Facility, and a floor with respect to the 2022 Revolver) plus an additional interest rate spread. 
 Interest expense, inclusive of debt amortization, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was million and million , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was million and million , respectively. 
 The fair value of the Company s long-term debt is based on the market value of its long-term debt instrument. Based on the inputs used to value the long-term debt, the Company s long-term debt is categorized within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company s long-term debt under the 2022 Credit Agreement was million, and the fair value of the Company s long-term debt was million. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company s long-term debt under the 2022 Credit Agreement was million, and the fair value of the Company s long-term debt was million. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement includes, among other things, customary negative and affirmative covenants (including reporting, financial and maintenance covenants) and events of default (including a change of control) for facilities of this type. In addition, the 2022 Credit Agreement includes a springing first lien leverage ratio financial covenant, which is applicable only to the lenders under the 2022 Revolver. The Co mpany was in compliance with these affirmative and negative covenants on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 2022 Term Loan Facility and the 2022 Revolver are secured by substantially all of the assets of Olaplex, Inc. and the other guarantors, subject to certain exceptions and thresholds. 
 Interest Rate Cap Transactions 
 
 The Company s results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement, including the 2022 Term Loan Facility. The Company may, from time to time, utilize interest rate derivatives in an effort to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. See further discussion in Note 5 - Fair Value Measurement .

 million and million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the same periods, the Company also recognized a million and million reduction, respectively, in interest expense related to the Company s receipt of funds as a result of the interest rate cap settlements with the Company s counterparty with respect to the Interest Rate Caps, partially offset by million and million, respectively, of interest expense related to amortization of the interest rate cap premiums paid by the Company in connection with the Interest Rate Caps. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s 2022 Interest Rate Cap generated an unrecognized pre-tax loss of million and a gain of million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the same periods, the Company also recognized a million and a million reduction, respectively, in interest expense related the Company s receipt of funds as a result of the interest rate cap settlements with the Company s counterparty, partially offset by million and million, respectively, related to amortization of the interest rate cap premium paid by the Company in connection with the 2022 Interest Rate Cap. 
 The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it hold or issue leveraged derivative instruments. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate fluctuations, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk. The Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of the applicable contracts.

 Company Overview 
 OLAPLEX is an innovative, science-enabled, technology-driven beauty company. Since our inception in 2014, we have focused on delivering effective, patent-protected and proven performance in the prestige hair care category. 
 OLAPLEX disrupted and revolutionized the prestige hair care category by creating the bond-building space in 2014. We have grown from an initial assortment of three products sold exclusively through the professional channel to a broader suite of products offered through the professional, specialty retail and DTC channels that have been strategically developed to address three key uses: treatment, maintenance and protection. Our patent-protected bond-building technologies relink disulfide bonds in human hair that are destroyed via chemical, thermal, mechanical, environmental and aging processes. Our current product portfolio is comprised of twenty-two unique and complementary products. 
 The strength of our business model and ability to scale have created a compelling financial profile. We have developed a synergistic omnichannel model that leverages the strength of each of our channels and our strong digital capabilities that we apply across our sales platforms. Our professional channel serves as the foundation for our brand. Through this channel, professional hairstylists introduce consumers to our products and, we believe, influence consumer purchasing decisions. Our specialty retail channel works to increase awareness of, and education for, our products and expand consumer penetration. Our DTC channel, comprised of Olaplex.com and sales through third-party e-commerce platforms, also provides us with the opportunity to engage directly with our consumers to provide powerful feedback that drives decisions we make around new product development. 
 Strategic Pillars 
 We are focused on executing against our key strategic pillars that we believe will support our long-term growth. These include igniting our global brand, disrupting with innovation, amplifying channel coverage and charting new geographies. These key strategic pillars are supported by our efforts to build capabilities and infrastructure that we believe will enable our aspirations. 
 Igniting our Global Brand 
 We believe we have built one of the most powerful brands in the prestige hair care category. We plan to continue growing awareness of our global brand, in an effort to deepen connections with existing customers as well as reach new audiences. We will also continue to invest in enhancing our brand equity. Our marketing model remains focused on implementing high return on investment, performance marketing activities aimed at fueling growth. Key levers of our marketing include organic social media activations, strategic paid media, education and training regarding our brand, community engagement with our professional hairstylists, influencer partnerships, and retailer activations such as sampling and in-store events. 
 Disrupting with Innovation 
 We believe we have a strong pipeline of disruptive innovation that leverages our science-based technology and patented ingredients. We plan to launch two-to-four products annually over the next three years. To support this pipeline, we intend to continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our internal innovation capabilities. We recently entered into hair care adjacent categories and remain excited about the opportunity to further grow where our technology can serve as a foundation for entry that we believe is supported by consumer trust in our brand.

 Amplifying Channel Coverage 
 In our professional channel, we have undertaken efforts to support and reassert strong relationships with the professional hairstylist community and maintain brand awareness by increasing our field support efforts, deepening partnerships with distributors and customers, and refreshing educational content. We are also pursuing opportunities to further penetrate premium and prestige salons. In specialty retail, we are enhancing visual merchandising in stores, investing in brand store pages online and deploying targeted communications intended to enable new customer acquisition. For our DTC business, we are evolving the digital experiences on Olaplex.com and third party e-commerce websites. On Olaplex.com, we expect to continue to invest in site enhancements and more advanced personalization efforts. 
 Charting New Geographies 
 We believe there is substantial opportunity to grow globally. Our priority international regions are currently key markets in Europe and Asia. Across Europe and other regions, we aim to implement our business model by first establishing a strong professional channel and then complementing that channel through entry into specialty retail and DTC. In Asia, we intend to partner with distributors in the region that will support omni-channel distribution and sales for our brand. 
 Supporting our Strategic Pillars 
 To enable these key growth pillars, we intend to continue to build our capabilities and infrastructure. These efforts extend across our organization, including focusing on cultivating top talent and building a strong corporate culture, evolving our operational capabilities as we scale, creating a strong financial foundation for growth, and ensuring that we have the right organizational infrastructure, technology and data to support our growth. 
 Business Environment Trends 
 We continue to monitor the effects of the global macro-economic environment, including the risk of recession, inflationary pressures, competitive products and discounting, currency volatility, high interest rates, social and political issues, geopolitical tensions and regulatory matters. We also are mindful of inflationary pressures on our consumers, and are monitoring the impact that increasing inflationary pressures may have on consumer spending and preferences and inventory rebalancing at our customers in an increasingly competitive industry. 
 Competition in the beauty industry is based on a variety of factors, including innovation, product efficacy, accessible pricing, brand recognition and loyalty, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce initiatives, sustainability and other activities. We have seen increased competitive activity including discounting in the prestige hair care category, which may continue in a heightened inflationary environment. We believe we have a well-recognized and strong reputation in our core markets and that the quality and performance of our products, our emphasis on innovation, and our engagement with our professional and consumer communities position us to compete effectively.

 Net Sales 
 We distribute products in the U.S. and internationally through professional distributors in salons, directly to retailers for sale in their physical stores and e-commerce sites, and DTC through sales to third party e-commerce customers and through our Olaplex.com website. As such, net sales by our three business channels consisting of professional, specialty retail and DTC for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:

 Total net sales decreased 3.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily attributed to a lower level of demand. This decline was partially offset by our launch of Browbond Building Serum in March 2024 and the launches of No. 5 Leave-In Moisturize Mend Leave-In Conditioner, No. 10 Bond Shaper Curl Defining Gel and Bond Shaper Curl Rebuilding Treatment in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as well as the impact of new customers within each channel. Net sales declined in the United States and certain markets in Western Europe, partially offset by increases in Eastern Europe and Latin America.

 As a result of the activity described above, our gross profit margin increased from 67.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 68.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary recurring source of cash is the collection of proceeds from the sale of our products to our customers, including cash periodically collected in advance of delivery or performance. 
 Our primary use of cash is for working capital and payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses as well as general operating expenses for marketing, fulfillment costs of customer orders, overhead costs, innovation, capital expenditures and debt servicing. We also utilize cash for strategic investments. Fluctuations in working capital are primarily caused by customer demand of our product, timing of when a retailer rearranges or restocks our products, timing of inventory purchases, and timing of our payables and expenses. Capital expenditures typically vary and are currently limited, and future capital expenditure requirements depend on strategic initiatives selected for the fiscal year, including investments in infrastructure, expansion into new national and international distributors and expansion of our customer base. 
 A considerable portion of our operating income is related to sales to customers outside of the U.S.; however, the majority of our bank deposits are held within the U.S. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 538.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had borrowing capacity of 150.0 million under the 2022 Revolver, plus 74.3 million of working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents for a combined liquidity position of 763.1 million.

 Net cash provided by operating activities was 93.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting our net income of 28.3 million, net of non-cash cost items and changes in operating working capital. Non-cash adjustments were primarily driven by amortization of other intangibles of 32.8 million, share-based compensation expense of 8.6 million and amortization of patent formulations of 7.1 million . Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by 8.9 million . 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 128.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily reflecting our net income of 47.5 million, net of non-cash cost items and changes in operating working capital.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash provided by operating activities by 21.7 million .

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Requirements

Table of Contents 

 If necessary, we may borrow funds under our 2022 Revolver to finance our liquidity requirements, subject to customary borrowing conditions. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to meet our operating, investing and financing needs depends, to a significant extent, on our future financial performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, competitive, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including those described in Item 1A. - Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. In addition to these general economic and industry factors, the principal factors in determining whether our cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements will be our ability to continue providing innovative products to our customers and consumers and manage production and our supply chain. 
 2022 Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding indebtedness under the 2022 Credit Agreement of 658.1 million , of which 6.8 million was classified as current. As of September 30, 2024, we had 150.0 million of available borrowing capacity unde r the 2022 Revolver. 
 The interest rate on outstanding amounts under the 2022 Term Loan Facility was 8.4 per annum as of September 30, 2024. We have not drawn on the 2022 Revolver as of September 30, 2024. The 2022 Term Loan Facility is repayable in mandatory quarterly installments equal to 1.6 million, with the balance payable at maturity. The maturity date of the 2022 Term Loan Facility is February 23, 2029, and the maturity date of the 2022 Revolver is February 23, 2027. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company s ability to (subject to certain exceptions) pay dividends and distributions or repurchase its capital stock, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations and sell or otherwise dispose of assets. The 2022 Credit Agreement also includes reporting, financial and maintenance covenants, including a springing first lien leverage ratio financial covenant. The Company was in compliance with these affirmative and negative covenants on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Substantially all the assets of the Company constitute collateral under the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 On August 11, 2022, we entered into the 2022 Interest Rate Cap in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, with a notional amount of 400.0 million, in order to limit our exposure to potential increases in future interest rates related to the 2022 Term Loan Facility. The 2022 Interest Rate Cap expired on July 31, 2024. 
 On May 7, 2024, in advance of the expiration of the 2022 Interest Rate Cap, we entered into the 2024 Interest Rate Cap in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, with a notional amount of 400.0 million, amortizing to 200.0 million on August 29, 2025. The 2024 Interest Rate Cap expires on July 31, 2026. We have designated the Interest Rate Caps as cash-flow hedges for accounting purposes. 
 See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement Obligations 
 In connection with the Reorganization Transactions, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement under which we will be required to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders 85 of the federal, state or local tax cash savings that we actually realize on our taxable income following the IPO, as a result of the amortization of intangible assets and capitalized transaction costs that existed as of the transaction date. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, generally we will retain the benefit of the remaining 15 of the applicable tax savings. 
 The Tax Receivable Agreement liability is calculated based on current tax laws and the assumption that we and our subsidiaries will earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Updates to our blended state tax rate, allocation of U.S. versus foreign sourced income and changes in tax rules on the amortization and depreciation of assets may significantly impact the established liability and changes would be recorded to other income (expense) in the period we made the determination. We expect that future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement relating to the Pre-IPO Tax Assets could aggregate to 185.4 million over the 11-year remaining period under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which began in the year ended December 31, 2022, are not conditioned upon the parties continued ownership of equity in the Company.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There were no material c hanges to our contractual obligations since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K . 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness. Although actual amounts may differ from such estimated amounts, we believe such differences are not likely to be material. For additional detail regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our discussion for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these critical accounting estimates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business. This includes risk associated with interest rates, our interest rate cap transactions, inflation and foreign exchange. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement. Our borrowings bear interest at a variable rate; therefore, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes generally affect the amount of our interest payments and, therefore, our future earnings and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024 , we h ad 658.1 million of outstanding variable rate loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility. Based on our September 30, 2024 variable rate lo an balances, an increase or decrease of 1 in the effective interest rate would cause an increase or decrease in interest cost of approxim ate ly 6.6 million over the next 12 months. 
 Interest Rate Cap 
 On May 7, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Interest Rate Cap in connection with the 2022 Term Loan Facility, as more fully described in Note 5 - Fair Value Measurement in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. We use the 2024 Interest Rate Cap to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The fair value of the 2024 Interest Rate Cap is measured at the end of each reporting period using observable inputs other than quoted prices. The fair value of the 2024 Interest Rate Cap recorded in other assets at September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase to the fair value of the 2024 Interest Rate Cap of approximately 0.3 million. A hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease to the fair value of the 2024 Interest Rate Cap of approximately 0.1 million. 
 Inflation 
 Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost to produce our products and overhead costs have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect , our operating results. Sustained increases in warehousing costs, transportation costs, wages and raw material costs, or other inflationary pressures in the future, may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit margin if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs, or if we cannot identify other cost efficiencies. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Our reporting currency, including our U.K. foreign subsidiary, Olaplex UK Limited, is the U.S. dollar. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income under the line-item Other income (expense), net. We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. We do not believe that an immediate 10 increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We have, and may in the future, from time to time, become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings incidental to our business, including litigation related to intellectual property, regulatory matters, contract, advertising and other consumer claims.

Regardless of outcome, litigation (including the litigation referenced below) can have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition and business, including by utilizing our resources and potentially diverting the attention of our management from the operation of our business.
