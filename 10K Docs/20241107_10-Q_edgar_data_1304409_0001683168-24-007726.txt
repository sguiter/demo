18 

The increase in share-based compensation is due
 to the following: 
 
 On March 22, 2021, the Company granted 2,000,000
 options at a price of 0.09 to four individuals, three Directors of the Company, the other a consultant to the Company. The options
 vest 50 upon issuance, and 25 on each of the first and second anniversaries of the grant date. The options were valued at 190,202 on
 the grant date and 50 vested on grant date with 25 vesting one year from grant date and the remaining 25 vesting two years from grant
 date. SBC expense totaling 14,262 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 On January 16, 2023, the Company granted 250,000
 options at a price of 0.0675 pursuant to the terms of the Company s Stock Option Plan. The options were issued to a consultant
 to the Company. The options were valued at 13,267 on the grant date and 50 vested on grant date with the remaining 50 vesting
 one year from grant date. Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) expense totaling 555 and 9,396 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
 and 2023. All options issued are fully vested. 
 
 On June 7, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate
 of 600,000 shares in the common stock of the Company to two independent directors and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company as compensation
 for their services resulting in SBC expense of 24,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The increase in stock exchange fees and related expenses was a result of fees paid in 2024 for state franchise fees. 

The decrease in other general expenses is due to a decrease in travel expenses in 2024 when compared to 2023 for various investor meeting and other administrative expenses. 

During the nine months September 30, 2024, we
incurred an increase of approximately 72,000, of exploration costs, which were costs associated with our geological surveys and mapping. 

Other income and expense: 

The revaluation of warrant liability for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is based on the following warrants that were issued as part of the private placements as detailed
in Note 3 to the financial statements.

During the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, the Company granted
3,333,333 options to purchase the Company s investment in Nubian Resources Ltd at an exercise price of CAD 0.06, the options expire
on January 31, 2025. The options had an initial valuation of 30,243. Outstanding warrants were revalued as of September 30, 2024, with
various inputs using a Black Scholes model and had a valuation of 34,215, resulting in an adjustment of 3,972 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company has no revenue
generating operations from which it can internally generate funds. To date, the Company s ongoing operations have been financed
by the sale of its equity securities by way of public offerings, private placements and the exercise of incentive stock options and share
purchase warrants. The Company believes that it will be able to secure additional private placements and public financings in the future,
although it cannot predict the size or pricing of any such financings. This situation is unlikely to change until such time as the Company
can develop a bankable feasibility study on one of its projects. 

In January 2024 the Company
completed a private placement in which we sold 5,000,000 units. We realized net proceeds of 148,341. 

Going Concern 

Our financial statements have been prepared on
a going concern basis, which assumes that we will be able to meet our obligations and continue our operations during the next fiscal year.
Asset realization values may be significantly different from carrying values as shown in our consolidated financial statements and do
not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values of assets and liabilities should we be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately
 7,000 of cash and a negative working capital of approximately 255,000. This compares to cash on hand of approximately 37,000 and negative
working capital of approximately 138,000 as at September 30, 2023. 

The Company expects that it will operate at a
loss for the foreseeable future and believes the current cash and cash equivalents and working capital will be sufficient for it to maintain
its currently held properties, fund its planned exploration, and fund its currently anticipated general and administrative costs for at
least the next 12 months from the date of this report. 

However, the Company does expect that it will
be required to raise additional funds through public or private equity financings in the future in order to continue in business in the
future past the immediate 12-month period. Should such financing not be available in that timeframe, the Company will be required to reduce
its activities and will not be able to carry out all of its presently planned exploration and, if warranted, development activities on
its currently anticipated scheduling. 

Capital Management 

The Company s objectives
when managing capital are to safeguard the Company s ability to continue as a going concern in order to pursue the development and
exploration of its mineral properties and to maintain a flexible capital structure, which optimizes the costs of capital to an acceptable
risk. 

20 

As of September 30, 2024,
the capital structure of the Company consists of 173,723,633 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001. The Company manages the capital
structure and adjusts it in response to changes in economic conditions, its expected funding requirements, and risk characteristics of
the underlying assets. The Company s funding requirements are based on cash forecasts. In order to maintain or adjust the capital
structure, the Company may issue new debt, new shares and/or consider strategic alliances. Management reviews its capital management approach
on a regular basis. The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have and never had any off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements.
The accounting positions described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. 

We believe that the significant estimates, assumptions
and judgments used when accounting for items and matters such as capitalized mineral rights, asset valuations, recoverability of assets,
asset impairments, taxes, and other provisions were reasonable, based upon information available at the time they were made. Actual results
could differ from these estimates, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures: 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily
applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable
assurance regarding management s control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our
CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date as a result of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties,
a limited corporate governance structure and insufficient formal management review processes over certain financial and accounting reports
as discussed in Item 9A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

While we strive to segregate duties as much as
practicable, there is an insufficient volume of transactions at this point in time to justify additional full-time staff. We believe that
this is typical in many exploration stage companies. We may not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until we commence mining
operations at which time, we would expect to hire more staff. We will continue to monitor and assess the costs and benefits of additional
staffing. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting: 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
