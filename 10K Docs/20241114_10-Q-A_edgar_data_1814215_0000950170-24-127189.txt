 and respectively, and the Company has an accumulated deficit of as of March 31, 2024. The Company anticipates that it will incur net losses for the foreseeable future and, even if it increases revenue, there is no guarantee that it will ever become profitable. All of the aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to continue to expand its operations, including by investing in manufacturing, sales and marketing, research and development and infrastructure to support its growth. Until the Company can generate sufficient revenue to cover its operating expenses, working capital, and capital expenditures, it will rely on private and public capital raising efforts. The Company plans to finance its operations with proceeds from the issuance and sale of equity securities or debt; however, there is no assurance that management's plans to obtain additional debt or equity financing will be successfully implemented or implemented on terms favorable to the Company. Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties The Company s current business activities consist of business planning, research and development efforts to design and develop high-power, high-brightness blue laser technology, and capital raising to finance the Company through full commercialization. The Company is subject to the risks associated with such activities, including the need to further develop its technology and its marketing and distribution channels; further develop its supply chain and manufacturing; and hire additional management and other key personnel. Successful completion of the Company s development program and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations, are dependent upon future events, including its ability to access potential markets and secure long-term financing. The Company s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company s future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, rapid technological change, competition from substitute products and larger companies, protection of proprietary technology, ability to maintain distributor relationships and dependence on key individuals. Restatement See Note 14, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements and Previously Issued Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , for additional information regarding the restatement of amounts included in the Company's previously issued financial statements as of March 31, 2024 .

 the cancellation and conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Legacy Nuburu common stock into shares of Nuburu Common Stock as adjusted by the Exchange Ratios; 

 the net exercise of all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Legacy Nuburu common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms and subsequent conversion into shares of Nuburu Common Stock at the Effective Time; 

 the cancellation and conversion of all Legacy Nuburu Convertible Notes, which were accounted for as liabilities at fair value due to certain variable share settlement features contained within the notes, into shares of Legacy Nuburu common stock in accordance with its terms as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shares were then outstanding as Legacy Nuburu common stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and subsequently converted into shares of Nuburu Common Stock and shares of Nuburu Series A preferred stock at the Effective Time; and

 The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP because Legacy Nuburu has been determined to be the accounting acquirer. Under this method of accounting, Tailwind, which is the legal acquirer, is treated as the accounting acquiree for financial reporting purposes and Legacy Nuburu, which is the legal acquiree, is treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of Legacy Nuburu have become the historical financial statements of Nuburu, and Tailwind s assets, liabilities and results of operations have been consolidated with Legacy Nuburu s beginning on the acquisition date. For accounting purposes, the financial statements of Nuburu represent a continuation of the financial statements of Legacy Nuburu with the Business Combination being treated as the equivalent of Legacy Nuburu issuing stock for the net assets of Tailwind, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Tailwind are stated at historical costs and no goodwill or other intangible assets have been recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination will be presented as those of Legacy Nuburu in future reports of Nuburu. Legacy Nuburu was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on evaluation of the following facts and circumstances: Legacy Nuburu stockholders comprise a majority of the voting power of Nuburu; 

 The Nuburu board of directors consists only of members of the Legacy Nuburu board of directors or nominees selected by Legacy Nuburu; 

 Legacy Nuburu s operations prior to the acquisition comprise the only ongoing operations of Nuburu; 

 Legacy Nuburu s senior management comprises the senior management of Nuburu; 

 Nuburu has assumed the Legacy Nuburu name; and 

 Legacy Nuburu s headquarters have become Nuburu s headquarters. 

 All periods prior to the Business Combination have been retrospectively adjusted using the Exchange Ratios for the equivalent number of shares outstanding immediately after the Closing to effect the reverse recapitalization. In connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, the Company received net proceeds from the Business Combination totaling million, prior to deducting transaction and issuance costs. Legacy Nuburu s total transaction expenses were approximately million and Tailwind s total transaction expenses were approximately million after taking into account waivers of costs incurred by Legacy Nuburu and Tailwind.

shares of Legacy Nuburu Series C Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million. Series A Preferred Stock Ranking The Company s Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company s Common Stock with respect to rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company. Dividends Holders of the Company s Preferred Stock participate, on an as-converted basis (without regard to any conversion limitations) in all dividends paid to the holders of the Company s Common Stock. Conversion Rights The Preferred Stock is convertible at any time into Common Stock at a conversion rate equal to (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock consolidation, subdivision or certain other events of a similar nature that increase or decrease the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding (the Original Issuance Price )) divided by the lesser of (i) and (ii) the greater of (x) of the lowest volume-weighted average price per share of the Company s Common Stock as displayed under the heading Bloomberg VWAP (the VWAP for any consecutive ninety-trading day period prior to the calculation of such VWAP and (y) , in each case subject to adjustment as set forth in the Certificate of Designations (the Conversion Price ). Any conversion will be settled only in shares of Common Stock; provided, that, upon any conversion that would result in the holders beneficially owning greater than of the Company s voting stock outstanding as of the conversion date or any individual holder beneficially owning Common Stock in excess of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that could be issued to the holder without triggering a change of control under the applicable stock exchange listing rules, the excess, if any, of the conversion consideration otherwise payable upon such conversion shall be paid in cash, based on an amount per share of Common Stock equal to the last reported price per share of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date.

of the Conversion Price for any trading days in a trading day period, the Company may elect to convert all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Stock then outstanding into the Company s Common Stock at a conversion rate with respect to each share of Preferred Stock equal to the Original Issuance Price as of the date of such conversion divided by the then applicable Conversion Price. Voting Rights The holders of Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote at or receive notice of any meeting of stockholders, except the holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to certain consent rights on matters related to (i) the creation or authorization of the creation of any equity or debt securities of the Company that rank senior or equal to certain rights of the Preferred Stock and (ii) the authorization of any adverse change to the powers, preferences, or special rights of the Preferred Stock set forth in the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, and shall have voting rights as required by law. Redemption On the second anniversary of the Closing Date, or January 31, 2025 (the Test Date ), the Company is obligated to redeem the maximum portion of the Preferred Stock permitted by law in cash at an amount equal to the Original Issuance Price as of such date if the Conversion Price exceeds the VWAP. If, on the Test Date, the Conversion Price is equal to or less than the VWAP, the Company must convert all shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding into shares of the Company s Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to redeem any shares of Preferred Stock to the extent the Company does not have legally available funds to effect such redemption. The mandatory redemption and conversion provisions described herein are further subject to certain limitations detailed in the Certificate of Designations. As a result of such redemption feature, the Company recorded the Preferred Stock at its redemption value and classified the Preferred Stock as mezzanine equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Series A Preferred Stock Issuances The Company is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock with a par value of per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company s board of directors. As of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Upon the Closing of the Business Combination, all shares of issued and outstanding convertible preferred stock were cancelled and converted into shares of Legacy Nuburu common stock based upon the conversion rate as calculated pursuant to Legacy Nuburu's Certificate of Incorporation, multiplied by the Exchange Ratios at the Effective Time. Additionally, upon the Closing of the Business Combination, the cancellation and conversion of all Legacy Nuburu Company Notes into shares of Legacy Nuburu common stock in accordance with its terms as of immediately prior to the Effective Time resulted in the issuance of shares which were then outstanding as Legacy Nuburu common stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and subsequently converted into shares of Nuburu Common Stock and shares of Nuburu Series A preferred stock at the Effective Time. As of the Closing, each Legacy Nuburu stockholder waived its right to participate in the Preferred Stock Issuance (for clarity, excluding any shares received as a result of the conversion of any Legacy Company Notes prior to the Closing, which were entitled to participate in the Preferred Stock Issuance). Legacy Nuburu stockholders were entitled to receive approximately of the Common Stock issued as merger consideration pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement agreed to waive such right by entering into the Stockholder Support Agreement (for clarity, excluding any shares received as a result of the conversion of any Legacy Company Notes). Those Legacy Nuburu stockholders who did not waive their right to participate resulted in the issuance of shares of Nuburu Series A preferred stock at the Effective Time. Each Tailwind stockholder who did not redeem their shares received a share of Nuburu Series A preferred stock. This resulted in the issuance of shares of Nuburu Series A preferred stock to those non-redeeming stockholders. Tailwind and the Tailwind Sponsor entered into the Sponsor Support and Forfeiture Agreement. In connection with the Business Combination, the Founder Shares were forfeited other than shares of Common Stock (of which, shares were transferred to Nautilus Maser Fund, L.P. and shares were transferred to Cohen Company Capital Markets at Closing) and shares of Series A preferred stock. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich Rosati, Professional Corporation WSGR was engaged by Legacy Nuburu to act as its counsel for the Business Combination. As partial compensation for the services provided by WSGR to Legacy Nuburu in connection with the Business Combination, the Company agreed to issue to WSGR shares of Common Stock and shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into by and between the Company and WSGR on March 10, 2023. The foregoing issuance was made in a transaction not involving a public offering pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Legacy Nuburu entered into an engagement letter with Anzu Partners on August 30, 2022 pursuant to which Legacy Nuburu, in recognition of past Services, (i) agreed to pay to Anzu Partners upon the closing of the Business Combination and (ii) issued a warrant with a strike price of per share to Anzu Partners for shares of Preferred Stock (the Anzu Partners Warrant ). This warrant was exercised by Anzu Partners in connection with the Closing and the payment was made during 2023.

shares of the Company's common stock. The Junior Note Warrants currently outstanding have an exercise price equal to per share (subject to adjustment per the Junior Note Purchase Agreements) and expire on . The Junior Note Purchase Agreements also provide for additional warrants to be issued if the Junior Notes remain outstanding for certain periods of time: (i) if the Junior Notes have not been repaid six months after issuance, additional warrants will be issued to each Lender in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Note multiplied by , and such quotient divided by a per share cash exercise price equal to of the Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") of the Company's Common Stock during the trading days immediately prior to issuance and (ii) if the Junior Notes have not been repaid nine months after issuance, additional warrants will be issued to each Lender in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Note multiplied by , and such quotient divided by a per share cash exercise price equal to of the VWAP of the Company's Common Stock during the trading days immediately prior to issuance. Based on the terms of the Junior Note Purchase Agreements, the Junior Note Warrants were evaluated under FASB ASC 815-40 - Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity ("ASC 815-40") and the Company concluded they did not initially meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity (deficit). Specifically, there were contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions that existed, as described above, where the number of shares available under the Junior Note Warrants may be adjusted. Because the number of outstanding common shares was not a fair value input to a fixed-for-fixed model, the Junior Note Warrants are treated as liabilities and are remeasured at each reporting date. The proceeds of were allocated first to the Junior Note Warrant liability at fair value and then to the Junior Notes. The Company further determined that the Junior Warrant liability meets the criteria to be accounted for as a bifurcated derivative due to the significant discount it creates on the Junior Notes. The aggregate fair value of the Junior Note Warrants was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation based approach, a Level 3 valuation.

Public Warrants In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, Nuburu assumed the Public Warrants outstanding on the date of Closing. As of March 31, 2024 , all Public Warrants remain outstanding. However, on December 12, 2023, the NYSE American notified the Company and publicly announced that the NYSE American had determined to (a) commence proceedings to delist the Company s Public Warrants, each whole Public Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of per share, and listed to trade on the NYSE American under the symbol BURU WS , and (b) immediately suspend trading in the Public Warrants due to abnormally low trading price levels. As such, the Public Warrants were determined to have no value in the financial statements as of March 31, 2024. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing days after the completion of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its Public Warrants only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. The Public Warrants will expire after the completion of the Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

 if the closing price of the Common Stock for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than per share, the Private Placement Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the estimated fair value of the underlying Common Stock and the exercise price of outstanding, in-the-money options. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. As of March 31, 2024 , total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to stock options was , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. Determining the appropriate fair value of stock based awards requires the input of subjective assumptions including the fair value of the Company s Common Stock, the expected life of the option, and expected stock price volatility. The Company used the Black Scholes option pricing model to value its stock option awards. The Company estimates the fair value of the options utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is dependent upon several variables, including expected option term, expected volatility of the Company s share price over the expected term, expected risk-free interest rate over the expected option term, and expected dividend yield rate over the expected option term, and actual forfeiture rates.

income tax expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. During these periods, the Company s activities were limited to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions, as it does not have any significant foreign operations. Due to the Company s history of cumulative losses and after considering all the available objective evidence, management concluded that it is not more likely than not that all of the Company s net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. Accordingly, the Company s deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss NOL carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development, continue to be subject to a valuation allowance as of March 31, 2024. The Company expects to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until there is sufficient evidence to support recoverability of its deferred tax assets. Utilization of the NOL carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Generally, in addition to certain entity reorganizations, the limitation applies when one or more "5-percent stockholders" increase their ownership, in the aggregate, by more than percentage points over a 36-month time period testing period, or beginning the day after the most recent ownership change, if shorter. The Company has determined that a Section 382 change in ownership occurred during 2023. As a result of this change in ownership, we expect that certain of the Company's NOLs may not be utilized in the future to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. However, due to the full valuation allowance recorded as of March 31, 2024, the limitation does not affect the Company's results of operations for the periods presented.

In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 Unless otherwise indicated, references in this section to Nuburu, we, us, our and the Company refer to Nuburu, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary, Nuburu Subsidiary, Inc. 
 The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 
 Company Overview 
 Nuburu, Inc. is a leading innovator in high-power, high-brightness blue laser technology that is focused on bringing breakthrough improvements to a broad range of high-value applications, including welding and 3D printing. By delivering increased speed and quality we hope to enhance productivity and cost efficiency for manufacturers in the e-mobility, consumer electronics, aerospace and defense, and 3D printing markets as well as to find additional applications currently not yet serviced by existing laser technologies. 
 We have invented, patented, and developed what we believe to be the next pivotal point for manufacturing technology, with the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing industry by changing how products are made. Our technology is also aligned with the need to reduce carbon generation in manufacturing. The Nuburu laser system outperforms currently available alternatives by more efficiently coupling heat into the material being processed, thereby helping to promote a more sustainable future by using less energy and, in turn, generating less carbon in the manufacturing process. 
 A fundamental physical characteristic is that metals absorb blue laser light better than infrared laser light. In the case of materials such as gold, copper, silver and aluminum, the advantage of blue laser light is substantial. The better absorption results in substantial improvements in the quality of the part produced, the yield of parts during production and the speed at which the part can be produced. We believe that these advantages enable efficiencies in the overall productivity of the manufacturing line and can extend the life of the products produced. We also believe that these characteristics will be advantageous to our customers, whether in upgrading existing manufacturing processes or enabling entirely new approaches to manufacturing through the use of Nuburu s laser systems in either industrial welding or 3D printing technology applications. 
 Nuburu is currently shipping blue laser systems for welding applications such as batteries, large screen displays, and cell phone components. Nuburu has over 220 granted and pending patents and patent applications globally, which include: blue laser applications such as welding, blue laser technologies, single mode blue laser technology, blue Raman laser technologies, addressable array technologies, and 3D printing using blue lasers. Notably, Nuburu has been awarded patent protection for the use of high-power blue lasers. 
 Given the size, complexity and value of our blue laser technology, our sales to date have come from long-term discussions between our management team and our current customers. Based on our experiences so far, we expect the approximate adoption timelines of our customers from first contact to first purchase order to range up to 22-24 months. Going forward, we intend to expand our marketing efforts and as we pursue a more widespread adoption of our blue laser technology. 
 We have developed and trained and expect to continue to develop and train third-party distributors that provide sales and customer support functions in their specific territory, including business development and sales, application and service support and local marketing. Our distributors are, and are expected to be, an integral part of our sales and marketing strategy. The Americas region is managed from our headquarters, but we have distributor partners located in key countries worldwide to help target current and prospective customers in Asia (particularly in China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, India, and Taiwan) and in Europe. 
 We generated total revenue of 93,549 and 469,989 and had net losses of 5,700,653 and 4,767,517 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we: 
 continue our research and development efforts; 

devote substantial resources to commercializing new products; and 

operate as a public company. 

Accordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity financings, debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition.

The Business Combination 
 On January 31, 2023, we consummated the Business Combination. We received net proceeds from the Business Combination totaling 3,243,079, prior to deducting transaction and issuance costs, which exceed this amount. 
 The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization for financial statement reporting purposes with Legacy Nuburu deemed to be the acquirer and Tailwind deemed to be the acquiree. Under this method of accounting, Tailwind will be treated as the acquired company for financial statement reporting purposes. 
 Being an SEC-registered and publicly traded company has required us to hire additional personnel and to implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. Compared to the operations of Legacy Nuburu, we have incurred and expect to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees, and additional internal and external accounting, legal, and administrative resources, including increased personnel costs, audit and other professional service fees. 
 Recent Developments 
 Operational Efficiency and Cost Reduction Measures 
 In the first quarter of 2024, management initiated measures designed to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs during fiscal year 2024, which included implementing temporary furloughs of employees. Management is reallocating resources and reducing operating and general administrative expenses to more properly align the Company s costs to anticipated near-term revenue, given the time required to qualify products with certain customers and establish long-term financing to support operations. 
 Special Shareholder Meeting 
 On February 22, 2024, we held a Special Meeting of Stockholders where stockholders of record as of January 22, 2024 approved proposals to authorize the Company to: (i) effect a reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Stock within a range from 1-for 30 to 1-for-75, with the exact ratio of the reverse stock split to be determined by the Company's board of directors, and (ii) issue up to 50.0 million of securities in one or more non-public offerings, where the maximum discount at which securities may be offered may be equivalent to a discount of up to 30 below the market price of the Company's Common Stock. As of the date of this report, we have not effected the reverse stock split, but intend to effect the split in the near future. 
 April 2024 SPA Agreement 
 On April 3, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with certain accredited investors pursuant to which such investors agreed to purchase from the Company 3,000,000 of newly issued shares (the Shares of the Company s Common Stock, at a per Share purchase price of 0.125 per Share, or 24,000,000 shares. 
 Pursuant to the SPA, the Company issued to the investors warrants exercisable for an amount of Common Stock equal to 100 of the Shares, which will be exercisable for 0.1625 per share of Common Stock and have a 5-year term. The investors also have the right to nominate two directors for election to the Company s board of directors. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Commercial Launch of Products 
 In 2022 and early 2023, we began the production and shipment of our AO-650 laser. We announced the commercial launch of the first laser in the NUBURU BL TM series, the BL-250, in January 2023. We announced the commercial launch of the BL-1Kw in June 2023 and in the early second quarter of 2024, we have expanded our BL product line to include the BL-300. We have shifted our future focus to manufacturing and shipping the BL series. 
 Adoption of our Blue Laser Technology 
 We believe that Nuburu blue laser technology offers a superior solution to improving a variety of aspects of welding and 3D printing, particularly in the manufacturing of batteries, consumer electronics, electric vehicles, renewable energy products and displays. However, our financial results will depend on the degree to which potential and current customers recognize the benefits of our blue laser technology and invest in our products. The selection process for our products is lengthy, typically up to 22-24 months, and may require us to incur costs in pursuing opportunities with no assurance that our products will be selected. 
 Capital Equipment 
 Our business is expected to depend substantially on capital expenditures by end users, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials processing, which includes general manufacturing, automotive (particularly electric vehicles), other transportation, aerospace, heavy industry, consumer, semiconductor, and electronics. Although applications within materials processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by end users of materials processing equipment and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending. 
 Recent inflationary pressures are resulting in global central banks adopting less accommodating monetary policies and increasing interest rates. Higher interest rates could impact global growth and could lead to a recession that may reduce the investment in capital equipment. In addition, higher interest rates would increase the cost of equipment financed with leases or debt.

Establishing Manufacturing Capacity 
 Nuburu s lasers are designed to be compatible with automated manufacturing methods. Nuburu continually improves the design of its lasers as well as the automation equipment required to manufacture these systems. We expect to work to reduce waste and limit costs while developing robust manufacturing processes with the aim of enhancing our competitive advantage in the marketplace. To do this, we are incorporating the Six Sigma Lean methodologies as well as ISO quality standards to ensure we meet customer expectations. With Six Sigma, we expect to further improve the quality of our products and decrease the variations that cause rework or defects. By incorporating the 5S pillars of the Six Sigma process into our day-to-day work life, we expect to develop a streamlined productive work environment ensuring organized and improved cycle times, with the aim of reducing the cost of goods sold. Through these tools we aim to create an environment that demands quality and performance, while reducing downtime and defects that are generated from undefined processes and underutilized talent. 
 We anticipate that as we ramp up our manufacturing, we will require additional engineers and production personnel to build out and then operate our manufacturing capabilities. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. We believe that these investments will sustain our position as a leader in the blue laser industry and will support the development of new products that can address new markets and growth opportunities. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period. 
 Inflationary Pressure 
 The U.S. economy has experienced increased inflation recently, including as a result of expansive monetary policy. Our cost to manufacture our systems is heavily influenced by the cost of the key components and materials used in each system, cost of labor, as well as cost of equipment. 
 Components of Statements of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Revenue consists of revenue recognized from sales and installation services of high-powered lasers. We have customers in the United States, Europe and Asia. In all sales arrangements, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of materials, overhead and employee compensation associated with the manufacturing of our high-powered lasers. Product cost also includes lower of cost or net realizable value inventory LCNRV adjustments if the carrying value of the inventory is greater than its net realizable value. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits, training, travel, third-party consulting services and laboratory supplies incurred to further our commercialization development efforts. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We anticipate research and development expenses to increase significantly as we expand our product portfolio. 
 Selling and Marketing 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for our direct sales force, sales management and marketing, and include stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel expenses. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs related to trade shows and marketing programs. We expense selling and marketing costs as incurred. We expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as we expand our sales force, marketing, and customer support organizations and increase our participation in trade shows and marketing programs. 
 General and Administrative 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for our finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, and include stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel expenses. In addition, general and administrative expenses include our third-party consulting and advisory services, legal, audit, accounting services and facilities costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable

future as we scale headcount with the growth of our business, and as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, legal, audit, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists primarily of interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest owed on our outstanding debt, as further described in Note 8 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of changes in the fair value of our liability-classified warrants, which are re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding gain or loss from the adjustment recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. Refer to Note 10 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information.

Revenue. Revenue decreased 376,440 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of laser system sales during the period as we work to optimize the BL TM series. 
 Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased 355,481 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a period-over-period decrease of 861,000 of direct job costs due to decreased production of the laser systems as we focus on optimizing the BL-250 and the BL-300. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately 410,000 of operations personnel expenses as we expanded our production team later in 2023 and approximately 146,000 of other overhead costs period-over-period. 
 Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased 565,810 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to approximately 242,000 of lower spend on the BL TM series as it transitioned to production in 2023 as well as 241,000 of lower personnel costs due to the cost reduction measures instituted by management in the first quarter of 2024, as further discussed in "Recent Developments" above. 
 Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased 169,334 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase is primarily due to the addition of our new Chief Marketing and Sales Officer in March 2023 as well as other sales and marketing personnel hired during late 2023 and early 2024. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 160,914 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily driven by decreased professional fees associated with legal, compliance and accounting matters, which were heightened in the first quarter of 2023 due to the Business Combination and the transition to being a public company.

Table of Contents 

Interest Income. Interest income decreased 20,687 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to lower cash balances between periods. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 950,867 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher debt balances between periods. Interest expense in the first quarter of 2024 was comprised of interest accrued on the Senior Convertible Notes and the debt discount amortization for the Junior Notes. No interest was incurred during the first quarter of 2023. Refer to Note 8 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information on our debt obligations. 
 Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net decreased 498,013 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the decrease in the fair value of the Public Warrants as of March 31, 2023. The difference in the fair value of the Public Warrants as of March 31, 2023 and the Closing decreased significantly and led to a gain of 501,324 recorded during the first quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Public Warrants have a zero value due to being delisted from the NYSE American, as further discussed in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. The gain recorded in the first quarter of 2024 resulted from the slight decrease in fair value of the Junior Note Warrants between December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, contractual obligations, and other commitments. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have yet to generate meaningful revenue from our business operations and have funded capital expenditure and working capital requirements through debt and equity financing. 
 As of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 231,885 as compared to 2,148,700 as of December 31, 2023. Our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our current operating model and expansion plans. On the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company must also, under certain circumstances, redeem the maximum portion of the Preferred Stock as permitted by law in cash at an amount equal to the Original Issuance Price as of such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to redeem any shares of Preferred Stock to the extent the Company does not have legally available funds to effect such redemption. 
 From inception through March 31, 2024, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we have incurred operating losses, including net losses of 5,700,653 and 4,767,517, respectively, and we have an accumulated deficit of 102,987,442 as of March 31, 2024. We anticipate that we will incur net losses for the foreseeable future and, even if we increase our revenue, there is no guarantee that it will ever become profitable. All of the aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expects to continue to expand our operations, including by investing in manufacturing, sales and marketing, research and development and infrastructure to support our growth. 
 Until we can generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses, working capital, and capital expenditures, we will rely on private and public capital raising efforts. 
 We would also obtain additional funds if the holders of our Public Warrants and private warrants issued in 2023 (refer to Note 10 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information) were to exercise their warrants. However, the exercise price is 11.50 per share of Common Stock for our Public Warrants, 1.03 per share of Common Stock for our Senior Note Warrants, and 0.25 per share of Common Stock for our Junior Note Warrants, respectively, which exceeds 0.131, the closing price of our Common Stock on the NYSE American on May 14, 2024. The likelihood that warrant holders will exercise the warrants and any cash proceeds that we would receive is dependent upon the market price of our Common Stock. If the market price for our Common Stock is less than the exercise price per share, we believe warrant holders will be unlikely to exercise their warrants. 
 The further development of our products, commencement of commercial operations and expansion of our business will require a significant amount of cash for expenditures. Our ability to successfully manage this growth will depend on many factors, including our working capital needs, the availability of equity or debt financing and, over time, our ability to generate cash flows from operations. 
 Given the Company s current liquidity position, the Company will need to raise additional capital. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, this would result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds by issuing any additional preferred stock, such securities may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of Common Stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, such debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of Common Stock. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of uncertainty that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing.

Cash flows from operating activities 
 Our cash flows used in operating activities to date have been primarily comprised of costs related to research and development, selling and marketing, and other general and administrative activities. We expect our expenses related to personnel, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative activities to increase as a result of operating as a public company. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 2,093,442 and 4,050,573 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net cash flows used in operating activities is primarily driven by decreased operating expenses and changes in working capital, partially offset by decreases in revenue. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Our cash flows from investing activities have been comprised primarily of purchases of equipment and installation of improvements to our leased facilities and headquarters. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was nil and 344,801 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to purchases of equipment to build out our production line that occurred during the first quarter of 2023. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of preferred stock and promissory notes. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 176,627 and 3,038,166 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing in activities in the first quarter of 2024 is comprised of proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock, offset by payments of accrued debt issuance costs for the Junior Notes. Net cash provided by financing in activities in the first quarter of 2023 is comprised of proceeds received from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and warrants, proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock from the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, and the proceeds received from the Closing of the Business Combination. These combined proceeds were partially offset by payments of transaction costs associated with the Business Combination. 
 Key Operating and Financial Metrics (Non-GAAP Results) 
 We regularly review several metrics, including the metrics presented in the table below, to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. The calculation of the key metrics and other measures discussed below may differ from other similarly-titled metrics used by other companies. 
 The following table presents our key performance indicators for the three months ended.

Table of Contents 

Non-GAAP Information 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operational performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively and in context, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies that may present similar non-GAAP financial measures. 
 EBITDA and Free Cash Flow 
 We define EBITDA as income (loss), plus (minus) depreciation and amortization expenses, plus (minus) interest, plus (minus) taxes and define Free cash flow as net cash from (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. EBITDA and Free cash flow are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP and these measures should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss), and net cash used in operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. Our computation of EBITDA and Free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA or Free cash flow in the same fashion. 
 Limitations of Non-GAAP Measures 
 There are a number of limitations related to EBITDA, including the following: 
 EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets. While these are non-cash charges, we may need to replace the assets being depreciated and amortized in the future and EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for these replacements or new capital expenditure requirements. 

EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, net, which may constitute a significant recurring expense in the future. 

Free cash flow does not reflect the impact of equity or debt raises or repayment of debt or dividends paid. 

Because of these and other limitations, EBITDA and Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Free cash flow on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of our net loss to EBITDA and net loss to Free cash flow below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 Our presentation of EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items and our presentation of Free cash flow does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund our cash needs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 
 For our contractual obligations that are expected to have an effect on our liquidity and cash flow, see section Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting policies described in our audited financial statements included in the Annual Report (as defined above). 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 We review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each new standard will have. For the recently issued and adopted accounting standards that we believe may have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements, see the section entitled Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures 
 Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We identified a material weakness in our control environment around the accounting and presentation of complex financial instrument transactions that was not effectively designed or maintained. This material weakness resulted in the restatements of the Company s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the comparative period therein as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for each of the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023 (as filed on Amendment No. 4 on Form 10-K/A on November 8, 2024) and the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 covered by this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A. Additionally, this material weakness could result in material misstatements of the financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Management s Remediation Efforts 
 We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. To remediate such weaknesses, we intend to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2025: (i) hire additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are dependent upon our receiving additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. 
 See Note 14, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements and Previously Issued Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A for additional information.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter of 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 In addition to the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should consider the following risk factor, which supplements those contained in in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our most recently filed Amended 10-K, in evaluating our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations or an investment in the shares of our company. Other than the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Amended 10-K. If any of the risks discussed in our Amended 10-K are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We have had to restate previously issued consolidated financial statements and, as part of that process, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reporting and prevent fraud. 
 On October 21, 2024, our Board of Directors and management, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the comparative period therein as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the interim quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024 should no longer be relied upon due to material weaknesses in our control environment related to the accounting and presentation of complex financial instrument transactions, as further described in Note 15, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements and Previously Issued Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 To remediate such weaknesses, we intend to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2025: (i) hire additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. These remediation measures may be time-consuming and costly, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate or are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations or enforcement actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 
 We can provide no assurance that the measures that we plan to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or a circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
