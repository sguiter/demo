Level III Pricing inputs are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. Fair value for these investments is determined using valuation methodologies that consider a range of factors, including but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, valuations for comparable companies, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, these values may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investments existed. Investments that are included in this category generally are privately-held debt, equity and certain convertible securities. 

 In certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Investment Manager s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. 

Observable inputs used in the market approach to derive a valuation multiple may include the public prices for securities issued by, and the relevant performance metrics of, companies deemed comparable to the investee company, and/or transaction prices involving significant equity interests in companies deemed comparable to the investee company. Unobservable inputs used in the market approach may include the key performance metric of the investee company, such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). 

 Investments may also be valued at their acquisition price for a period of time after an acquisition as the best measure of fair value in the absence of any conditions or circumstances that would indicate otherwise. In the event of an announced sale of investments with a definitive agreement in place, investments may also be valued using a discount-to-sale

 approach as the primary method with emphasis given to certain considerations including, but not limited to unitholder approval, regulatory approval, financing, completion of due diligence and break-up
 fees. 

 Investments in debt securities that are not listed on an exchange, but for which external pricing sources, such as dealer quotes or independent pricing services may be available, are valued by the Aggregator after considering, among other factors, such external pricing sources, recent trading activity or market transactions of similar securities adjusted for security specific factors such as relative capital structure priority and interest and yield risks. 

 Derivative Instruments are valued based on contractual cash flows and observable inputs generally comprising of yield curves and foreign currency rates. 

 Publicly-traded investments in active markets are reported at the market closing price, less a discount, as appropriate, as determined by the Aggregator to reflect restrictions on disposition where such restrictions are an attribute of the investment. 

 Convertible preferred investments may be valued using an option pricing model based on the specific terms of the security, including but not limited to, the publicly-traded share price of the common shares or units in active markets as of the reporting date, preferred-in-kind

 dividend rate, relative yield and other adjustments to the common shares or units, as well as restrictions related to timing of conversion, as applicable, or actual trades of the convertible preferred investment. 

 Investments in Affiliated or Unaffiliated Investee Funds 

Investments in affiliated or unaffiliated investee funds Investee Funds are generally valued using the reported net asset value NAV or Net Asset Value of the Investee Funds as a practical expedient for fair value. The Aggregator may, as a practical expedient, estimate the fair value of an Investee Fund based on NAV if the reported NAV of the Investee Fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles applied to investment companies and the Aggregator has internal processes to independently evaluate the fair value measurement process utilized by the underlying Investee Fund to calculate the Investee Fund s NAV, both of which are in accordance with ASC 946. Such internal processes include the evaluation of the Investee Fund s own process and related internal controls in place to estimate the fair value of its underlying investments that are included in the NAV calculation, perform ance of
 ongoing operational due diligence, review of the Investee Fund s financial statements and ongoing monitoring of other relevant qualitative and quantitative factors. If the Aggregator determines, based on its own due diligence and investment monitoring procedures, that NAV does not represent fair value or if the Investee Fund is not an investment company, such as a collateralized loan obligation CLO vehicle, the Aggregator will estimate the fair value in good faith and in a manner that it reasonably chooses, in accordance with its valuation policies.

 Investments in Affiliated Investee Funds 

The following table summarizes investments in affiliated Investee Funds, by investment strategy, the unfunded commitment of each strategy (if applicable) and the fair value of the investments in the affiliated Investee Funds. As of September 30, 2024, a majority of these investments may not be redeemed at or within three months of the reporting date. The Aggregator may receive distributions resulting from income and/or sales of underlying assets; however, an estimate of the period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated by the Investee Funds cannot be made.

 for partial periods), and without taking into account accrued and unpaid taxes of any intermediate entity through which BXPE indirectly invests in an investment or taxes paid by any such intermediate entity during the applicable month. For the first calendar year of BXPE s operations, the allocation is paid at the end of such first calendar year, and thereafter, the allocation will be paid quarterly. The General Partner may elect to receive the Performance Participation Allocation in cash, the Aggregator s, BXPE U.S. s, the Feeder s, or the Parallel Fund s units and/or equity of intermediate entities. If the Performance Participation Allocation is paid in units, such units may be repurchased at the General Partner s request and will be subject to certain limitations. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Aggregator accrued unrealized Performance Participation Allocation of million and million, respectively. The amount of unrealized Performance Participation Allocation accrued is as if BXPE had been liquidated at its net asset value at that date and at that time, if any, will be paid or realized to the General Partner. The unrealized Performance Participation Allocation is subject to the future performance of BXPE throughout the Performance Participation Allocation period of each limited partner.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the related notes of Blackstone Private Equity Strategies Fund L.P. and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes of BXPE US Aggregator (CYM) L.P. both included within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In this report, we refer to Blackstone Private Equity Strategies Fund L.P. as BXPE U.S. The terms BXPE, the Fund, we, us or our collectively refers to BXPE U.S., Blackstone Private Equity Strategies Fund (TE) L.P. (the Feeder ), BXPE US Aggregator (CYM) L.P. (the Aggregator and its consolidated subsidiaries and any Parallel Funds (as defined in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements), as the context requires. BXPE and Blackstone Private Equity Strategies Fund SICAV BXPE Lux are together referred to as the BXPE Fund Program. 

 The investment activities of BXPE are carried out through the Aggregator, a non-consolidated
 affiliate of BXPE U.S. As such, in this discussion and analysis, we believe it is important to present information for both BXPE U.S. and the Aggregator. The unaudited financial statements of each entity are presented in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this document and for information related to the principles of consolidation see Critical Accounting Estimates Principles of Consolidation. 

 Overview 

BXPE U.S. was organized on April 5, 2022 as a Delaware limited partnership. BXPE U.S. is a private fund exempt from registration under Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. 

 We invest primarily in privately negotiated, equity-oriented investments Private Equity Investments ), leveraging the talent and investment capabilities of Blackstone s private equity platform (the PE Platform to create an attractive portfolio of alternative investments diversified across geographies and sectors. Our General Partner and our Investment Manager are affiliates of Blackstone and are collectively referred to as the Sponsor. 

 BXPE s investment strategy includes investments in: 

Corporate Private Equity Control and control-oriented investments in companies with durable businesses, including majority and minority common equity investments in operating companies and equity-linked investments with uncapped upside. 

Opportunistic Investments across a wide range of asset classes, sectors, industries, geographies and places in the capital structure, including preferred equity with capped upside, structured equity investments, or contractual arrangements that generate a yield with a focus on downside protection and less volatile returns. 

Growth Investments in businesses that are growing and looking to further accelerate that growth to achieve market leading positions in their respective sectors, including majority and minority common equity investments in operating companies with a meaningful amount of top-line
 growth in certain sectors, financing of life sciences products in late-stage development and any equity investments in life sciences companies. 

Secondaries Investments in limited partner interests in private funds in the secondary market, including transactions across traditional limited partner secondaries and general partner or sponsor-led
 secondaries. 

 We access Private Equity Investments in a variety of ways, including through: 

Direct Investments Investments in companies and other private assets, 

48 

Table of Contents 

Secondary Investments Secondary market purchases of existing investments in established funds managed by Blackstone affiliates or third party managers and 

Primary Commitments Capital commitments to commingled, blind pool investment funds managed by Blackstone or third party managers. 

To a lesser extent, we also invest in debt and other securities Debt and Other Securities ), including but not limited to loans, debt securities, public equities, interests in collateralized debt obligation and loan obligation vehicles, derivatives, money market instruments, cash and cash equivalents. Debt and Other Securities are generally expected to be liquid, and may be used to generate income, facilitate capital deployment and provide a potential source of liquidity. 

 We employ a thematic approach to private equity investing with a focus on transactions where Blackstone s scale, brand and/or operating intervention capabilities create competitive advantages for the BXPE Fund Program. We expect that over the long-term, we will invest at least 80 of our net asset value NAV or Net Asset Value in Private Equity Investments and up to 20 of our NAV in Debt and Other Securities. Our investments may vary materially from these indicative allocation ranges, including due to factors such as a large inflow to capital over a short period of time, the Sponsor s assessment of the relative attractiveness of opportunities, or an increase in anticipated cash requirements or repurchase requests and subject to any limitations or requirements relating to applicable law. We may make investments by investing in or alongside Other Blackstone Accounts, subject to the terms and conditions of our and such Other Blackstone Accounts governing documents. 

 Investment Portfolio 

The BXPE Fund Program s portfolio is primarily invested in companies headquartered in North America and diversified across Blackstone s key private equity strategies, including Corporate Private Equity, Opportunistic, Growth and Secondaries. As of September 30, 2024, the BXPE Fund Program s portfolio consisted of investments and future commitments to acquire investments totaling up to 6.3 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the BXPE Fund Program has invested or committed 4.0 billion in Corporate Private Equity investments, 1.5 billion in Opportunistic investments, 458.1 million in Growth investments and 330.0 million in Secondaries. 

 Future commitments to acquire investments are held among the BXPE Fund Program and BXPE s allocation will be determined at closing. As of September 30, 2024, BXPE has funded 3.9 billion to investments, committed an additional 611.4 million to closed investments where BXPE s allocation is known and committed, together with BXPE Lux, up to 1.2 billion to new investments for which BXPE s allocation will be determined upon closing. 

 Any investments that have not yet closed are subject to customary closing conditions and may not close as expected or at all. For additional information on BXPE s investments, refer to the Condensed Consolidated Schedule of Investments of BXPE US Aggregator (CYM) L.P. in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition to the commitments above, the BXPE Fund Program has agreed to participate in future investment opportunities alongside Other Blackstone Accounts across the PE Platform through additional investments in Blackstone s side-by-side

 investment program, which is just one method through which the BXPE Fund Program accesses investments. The total commitments to such opportunities will be determined at closing and there can be no assurance that such transactions will close as expected or at all. 

 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, BXPE committed 952.0 million to a Corporate Private Equity investment within the business services sector. BXPE expects to fund less than the full commitment upon the closing of the transaction as a result of investment-level financing and equity syndications.

 Key Components of Our Results of Operations and Financial Metrics 

From inception through January 2, 2024, we had not commenced our principal operations and were focused on our formation and preparation for fundraising and the commencement of investment operations. Our key financial measures and the results of operations are discussed below. 

 Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Allocated from BXPE US Aggregator (CYM) L.P. 

BXPE U.S. generates income primarily from its investment in the Aggregator. BXPE U.S. has an interest of 73.5 in the Aggregator as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.4 compared to an interest of 72.1 as of June 30, 2024. The increase in BXPE U.S. interest is driven by relative subscriptions between BXPE U.S. and the Parallel Fund. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Aggregator generated a Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations of 182.3 million and 320.3 million, respectively, which resulted in BXPE U.S. recognizing a Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Allocated from BXPE US Aggregator (CYM) L.P. of 133.0 million and 238.8 million, respectively. There were no net realized gains or losses from the investment in the Aggregator for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Key drivers of the result of operations of the Aggregator are discussed below. 

 Aggregator Income, Expenses and Net Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments, Derivative Instruments and Translation of Assets and Liabilities in Foreign Currencies

 The Aggregator s Private Equity Investments and Debt and Other Securities also generate net realized and unrealized gains and losses and net realized and unrealized gains and losses of foreign exchange translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Realized gains or losses are measured as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale, repayment, or disposal of an asset and the adjusted cost basis of the asset, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. Net change in unrealized gains or losses reflects the change in investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses, when gains or losses are realized. 

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Aggregator recorded 30.0 million and 93.4 million of Interest Income, respectively, driven by interest earned on Debt and Other Securities.

Transactional Net Asset Value 

BXPE U.S. calculates its Transactional NAV per Unit in accordance with valuation policies and procedures that have been approved by the Board of Directors. BXPE U.S. s Transactional NAV is the price at which it sells and repurchases its Units and serves as a basis for certain fees incurred by BXPE U.S. The Sponsor also evaluates changes to BXPE U.S. s Transactional NAV to monitor fund performance. BXPE U.S. s Transactional NAV is based on the month-end values of its investments and other assets and the deduction of any liabilities, including certain fees and expenses, in all cases as determined in accordance with its valuation policy that has been approved by the Board of Directors. Organizational and offering expenses advanced on BXPE U.S. s behalf by the Investment Manager are recognized as a reduction to BXPE U.S. s Transactional NAV ratably over 60 months beginning on January 1, 2025, and Unitholder servicing fees, as applicable, are recognized as a reduction to BXPE U.S. s Transactional NAV on a monthly basis as such fees are accrued. Certain contingent tax liabilities may not be recognized as a reduction to BXPE U.S. s Transactional NAV if the General Partner reasonably expects such liabilities will not be recognized upon divestment of the underlying investment.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP involves significant judgments and assumptions and requires estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments will affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our significant accounting policies that we believe are the most affected by our judgments, estimates and assumptions. 

 Fair Value 

As investment companies under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies

 ASC 946 ), BXPE U.S. and the Aggregator are required to report investments, including those for which current market values are not readily available, at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements

 ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. The fair value process is used to both recognize the investments in accordance with GAAP and for purposes of computing a monthly Transactional NAV. 

 Private Equity Direct Investments that Are Publicly Traded in Active Markets 

Securities that are publicly traded and for which market quotations are readily available will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades. If market quotations are not readily available, the fair value will be determined in good faith by the Sponsor using a widely accepted valuation methodology on the valuation date. 

 In some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions that limit their purchase or sale for a period of time. A discount to publicly traded price may be appropriate in instances where a legal restriction is a characteristic of the security. The amount of the discount, if taken, will be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale. 

 Private Equity Direct Investments that Are Not Publicly Traded 

Investments for which market prices are not observable include investments in common equity or preferred equity of operating companies. The primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach, whereby fair value is derived based on the present value of cash flows that a business, or security is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method, which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment s projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. The Sponsor s secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is typically the market approach. The most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions or assets are comparable. In certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. Depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, probability weighted methods and/or recent round of financing. Generally, material differences between the primary and secondary approaches will be investigated and updates may be made to model inputs as deemed necessary.

 Secondary Investments and Primary Commitments 

Secondary Investments and Primary Commitments are generally valued based on the latest NAV reported or provided by the investment fund s investment advisor or investment manager. If the latest NAV of an investment fund is not available at the time BXPE U.S. is calculating its NAV, the Sponsor will update the last available NAV by recognizing any cash flow activity for the investment fund during the month. Cash flows since the reference date of the last NAV received by an investment fund are recognized by adding the nominal amount of the investment-related capital calls and deducting the nominal amount of investment-related distributions from the NAV as reported. 

 Debt and Other Securities 

In general, Debt and Other Securities will be valued by the Sponsor based on market quotations or at fair value determined in accordance with the valuation policy and are accounted for on a settlement basis. 

 Market quotations may be obtained from third party pricing service providers or, if not available from third party pricing service providers, broker-dealers for certain of the Aggregator s Debt and Other Securities. Securities that are traded publicly on an exchange or other public market (stocks, exchange traded derivatives and securities convertible into publicly-traded securities, such as warrants) will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades. 

 If market quotations are not readily available (or are otherwise not reliable for a particular investment), the fair value will be determined in good faith by the Sponsor. The primary methodology for determining the fair value of such investments is generally a yield analysis whereby the Sponsor determines if there is adequate collateral value supporting such investments and whether the investment s yield approximates market yield. If the market yield is estimated to approximate the investment s yield, then such investment is valued at its par value. If the market yield is not estimated to approximate the investment s yield, the Sponsor will project the expected cash flows of the investment based on its contractual terms and discount such cash flows back to the valuation date based on an estimated market yield. Market yield is estimated based on a variety of inputs regarding the collateral asset(s) performance and capital market conditions, in each case as determined in good faith by the Sponsor. The Sponsor may determine that certain Investments in Debt and Other Securities will be valued using different procedures. 

 Sponsor Process on Fair Value 

Due to the importance of fair value throughout the consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, the Sponsor has developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. 

 For investments valued utilizing the income method and where the Sponsor has information rights, the Sponsor generally has a direct line of communication with each of the portfolio companies and underlying assets finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. The valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple or capitalization rate and any other valuation input relevant to economic conditions. 

 The results of all valuations of investments are reviewed by the BXPE Fund Program valuation sub-committee,
 which is comprised of key personnel including BXPE Fund Program s Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Portfolio Manager and the Investment Manager s Chief Compliance Officer. See Part I. Item 1. Business Investment Process Overview in BXPE U.S. s Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for the year ended December 31, 2023. To further corroborate results, each quarter, the Sponsor will engage a qualified, independent valuation advisor to provide positive assurance for the valuations of each of the 

55 

Table of Contents 

 Aggregator s Direct Investments prepared by the Sponsor. It is expected that the independent valuation advisor will provide such positive assurance on a rolling basis throughout the quarter, such that the Aggregator s Direct Investments may be reviewed at different times during the quarter but that the independent valuation advisor would provide positive assurance on each Direct Investment at least once per quarter. Additionally, a second independent valuation advisor will provide a more detailed range of value analysis on a rolling basis throughout the year, such that the value of Aggregator s Direct Investments may be estimated by an independent valuation advisor at different times during the year but that the independent valuation advisor would provide a range of value on each Direct Investment at least once per year. Both independent valuation advisors will be engaged on a monthly basis and will review a portion of the portfolio each month. Finally, valuation is subject to the annual audit of the financial statements performed by our independent auditor. 

 Servicing Fees 

Pursuant to the Dealer Manager Agreement entered into between BXPE U.S., the Feeder and Blackstone Securities Partners L.P. (the Dealer Manager ), BXPE U.S. pays the Dealer Manager a servicing fee in the amount of (a) 0.85 per annum of the aggregate NAV for the Class S Units as of the last day of each month and (b) 0.25 per annum of the aggregate NAV for the Class D Units as of the last day of each month, in each case, payable monthly. BXPE U.S. or its affiliates do not pay the Dealer Manager a servicing fee in respect of the purchase of any Class I Units. In calculating the servicing fee, BXPE U.S. uses its NAV before giving effect to any accruals for the servicing fee, repurchases, if any, for that month and distributions payable on its Units. 

 BXPE U.S. accrues the cost of the servicing fees for the estimated life of its Units as an offering cost at the time it sells Class S Units and Class D Units. The calculation of the estimated amount of servicing fees to be paid in future periods includes significant estimates including the estimated life of the Units held by a Unitholder and judgments including market expectations. Servicing Fees Payable as of September 30, 2024 is 92.4 million. 

 Principles of Consolidation 

BXPE U.S. and the Aggregator are both investment companies under ASC 946. There is inherent judgment in how to apply ASC Topic 810, Consolidation

 ASC 810 ), to instances where an investment company invests in another investment company as generally investment companies do not consolidate their investments and rather report them at fair value. BXPE U.S. considered the guidance in ASC 810, ASC 946 and certain SEC industry guidance in concluding that non-consolidation
 of the Aggregator by BXPE U.S. was appropriate. In considering ASC 810, the following factors were deemed important in supporting a conclusion that BXPE U.S. does not have a controlling financial interest in the Aggregator: (a) the Aggregator s purpose is to pool investments across funds from various regions, (b) there is no contractual mechanism for BXPE U.S. to control the Aggregator and (c) substantially all of the Aggregator s activities are not conducted on behalf of BXPE U.S. BXPE U.S. believes non-consolidation
 is the financial presentation that most meaningfully presents the financial position and results of operations. As the investment in and operations of the Aggregator are an integral part of BXPE U.S. s financial statements, two sets of financial statements are included in this report, one for BXPE U.S. and one for the Aggregator. Barring a significant change to the activities and structure of the Aggregator, we do not expect this consolidation conclusion and the resulting presentation to change. 

 Recent Accounting Developments 

For information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on BXPE U.S. and the Aggregator, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements of Blackstone Private Equity Strategies Fund L.P. and Note 2.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Uncertainty with respect to economic conditions introduces significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effect of that volatility could materially impact our market risks. We are subject to financial market risks, including fair value risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. 

 Fair Value Risk 

BXPE makes Private Equity Investments and, to a lesser extent, investments in Debt and Other Securities, all of which are reported at fair value. Determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments made by BXPE. Based on the fair value of the portfolio companies and debt investments as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that a 10 decline in the fair value of such investments would result in a decline in the Net Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments of the Aggregator of 508.5 million and a decline in BXPE U.S. s Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Allocated from BXPE US Aggregator (CYM) L.P. of 332.1 million. 

 Exchange Rate Risk 

BXPE holds investments that are denominated in non-U.S.
 dollar currencies that may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S.
 dollar currencies. BXPE may manage exposure to investments in portfolio companies in foreign currencies by hedging such risks. As of September 30, 2024, the Aggregator held foreign currency contracts to hedge a change in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We estimate that as of September 30, 2024, a 10 decline in the rate of exchange of all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in a decline in the Net Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments, Derivative Instruments and Translation of Assets and Liabilities in Foreign Currencies of the Aggregator of 139.6 million and a decline in BXPE U.S. s Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Allocated from BXPE US Aggregator (CYM) L.P. of 88.4 million. 

 Interest Rate Risk 

BXPE has a diversified portfolio of liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs. This portfolio includes open-ended money market funds, bank loan debt instruments, treasury securities and other debt investments that are exposed to interest rate risks and BXPE may utilize a wide variety of derivative instruments to manage such risks. As of September 30, 2024, BXPE has not entered into any derivative instruments or other arrangements to hedge an increase in interest rates. If interest rates were to increase by one percentage point, we estimate annualized Interest Income of the Aggregator would increase by 7.6 million and BXPE U.S. s Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Allocated from BXPE US Aggregator (CYM) L.P. would increase by 4.8 million. 

 In the event interest rates rise, the assumed cost of capital for portfolio companies would likely increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, which could negatively impact such investment s valuations. These impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates and the length of time such rates remain elevated and may, in certain cases, offset positive increases in fair value changes on other investments. Further, increases in interest rates may over time result in lower valuations of certain debt investments whose interest rates are not variable.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
 and 15d-15(e)
 under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives. 

 Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15
 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
 under the Exchange Act) are effective at the reasonable assurance level to accomplish their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
 and 15d-15(f)
 under the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

 Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently subject to any pending material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. We may also be subject to regulatory proceedings. 

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our subsequently filed periodic reports as such factors may be updated from time to time, all of which are accessible on the Securities and Exchange Commission s website at www.sec.gov and www.bxpe.com. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

in Section 2.03(c) , each Committed Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Committed Loans or Daily Simple RFR Loans in Dollars shall be in a principal amount of 250,000 or a whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof
(or such other amount as agreed by the Administrative Agent). Each Committed Loan Notice shall specify (i) the name of the applicable Borrower, (ii) whether such Borrower is requesting a Committed Borrowing, a conversion of Committed Loans
from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, (iii) the requested date of the Committed Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iv) the principal
amount of Committed Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (v) the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans are to be converted, (vi) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect
thereto, (vii) the currency of the Committed Loans to be borrowed, (viii) the applicable Tranche and (ix) the location and number of the account of the applicable Borrower to which funds are to be disbursed. If such Borrower fails to
specify a currency in a Committed Loan Notice requesting a Committed Borrowing, then the Committed Loans so requested shall be made in Dollars. If such Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice, then the
applicable Committed Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans. If such Borrower fails to timely request a continuation of Committed Loans, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be continued as Committed Loans in their original currency with an
Interest Period of the same length as the then- 
 57 

expiring Interest Period. Any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate
Loans. If such Borrower requests a Committed Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, or a conversion to Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to
have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. No Committed Loan may be converted into or continued as a Committed Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Committed Loan and
reborrowed in the other currency. (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender of the amount (and currency) of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Committed Loans, and whether such Committed Loans are with respect to a Temporary Increase Tranche. In the case of a Committed Borrowing, each Lender shall make the
amount of its Committed Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent s Office for the applicable currency not later than 1:00 p.m., in the case of any Committed Loan denominated in Dollars, and not
later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Committed Loan in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 , the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the applicable Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by
(i) crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of Wells Fargo with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the
Administrative Agent by such Borrower; provided , however , that if, on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to such Committed Borrowing denominated in Dollars is given by such Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding in
respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, then the proceeds of such Committed Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and, second, shall be made available to such Borrower as
provided above. (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, may be continued or
converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Loan. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so
notifies the Initial Primary Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, no Loans may be requested as, or converted to, RFR Rate Loans (whether in Dollars or any Alternative Currency) or Eurocurrency Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans and/or RFR Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount
of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect to such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date with respect to such RFR Rate Loans. 
 (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Initial Primary Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest
Period for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and applicable to any RFR Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Initial Primary Borrower and the Lenders of
any change in Wells Fargo s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. 
 58 

(e) After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all conversions of Committed Loans from one
Type to the other, and all continuations of Committed Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than fifteen (15) Interest Periods in effect with respect to Committed Loans, unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Administrative
Agent. (f) In the aggregate, no more than (i) twenty five (25) Committed Borrowings, and (ii) thirty five
(35) Committed Borrowings and Temporary Increase Loans, in each case, that are Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Rate Loans, may be outstanding at any one time, unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Administrative Agent.

set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Borrower s ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly such Borrower may,
during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. 
 (ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if: 
 (A) subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii) , the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur
more than twelve (12) months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the L/C Issuer has approved such expiry date; or

(B) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the
Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless the L/C Issuer has approved such expiry date or such Letter of Credit has been Cash Collateralized in accordance with Section 2.17 ; provided that no Letter of Credit shall
have an expiry date that falls more than twelve (12) months after the Maturity Date then in effect unless all of the Lenders have approved such expiry date. 
 (iii) The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: 
 (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain
the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or
request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement
(for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in
good faith deems material to it; (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the L/C
Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally; (C) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the L/C
Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than 500,000; (D) except as otherwise agreed by the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars or an Alternative Currency; 
 (E) the L/C Issuer does not, as of the issuance date of such requested Letter of Credit, issue Letters of Credit in the
requested currency (other than Dollars, Euro or Sterling); or (F) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless
the L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the applicable Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer s actual or potential
Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations
as to which the L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion. 
 60 

(iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer would
not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof. (v) The L/C
Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter
of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit. (vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the
Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts
taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used
in Article IX included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer. 
 (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit . 
 (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the applicable Borrower delivered
to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days (or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date
of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the name of the applicable
Borrower; (B) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the amount and currency thereof; (D) the expiry date thereof; (E) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof;
(F) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (H) the purpose and nature of the
requested Letter of Credit; and (I) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail
satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the L/C Issuer
may reasonably require. Additionally, the applicable Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer
Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require. 
 61 

(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer
will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the applicable Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative
Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Borrower, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter
of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the
applicable Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall
be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such
Letter of Credit. (iii) If a Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C
Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve (12) month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date in each such twelve (12) month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the applicable Borrower
shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the
extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided , however , that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined
that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or
 Section 2.03(a)(iii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the
 Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the applicable
Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
 62 

(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a
Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
 (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations . 
 (i) The L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof upon receipt from the beneficiary
of any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit. In the case of a Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Borrower denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower
shall reimburse the L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency, unless such Borrower shall have notified the L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that such Borrower will reimburse the L/C Issuer in Dollars. In the case of any
such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Borrower denominated in an Alternative Currency, the L/C Issuer shall notify such Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly
following the determination thereof. Not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Borrower to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment
by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Borrower to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an Honor Date ), if such Borrower shall have received notice of such drawing prior to 10:00 a.m.
on such date (or, if such notice has not been received by such Borrower prior to 10:00 a.m. on the Honor Date, then not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately following the Business Day on which such Borrower receives such notice),
such Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency; provided that such Borrower shall conclusively be deemed, subject to the amount of
the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions to borrowing set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by such Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice), to have requested that such payment be
financed on the date such drawing is required to be reimbursed with a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount (as defined below), without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in
 Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Committed Borrowing. If there
is no such deemed Committed Borrowing as provided for in the previous sentence and such Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the
unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Lender s
Applicable Percentage thereof. Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing. 
 63 

(ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
 Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its
Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii) , each Lender
that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount
of Base Rate Loans. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer in Dollars. (iii) With
respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the applicable
Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear
interest at the Applicable Rate. In such event, each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its
participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03 . 
 (iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer. 
 (v) Each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under
Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, any Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default or Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or
condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however , that each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth
in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the applicable Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L/C
Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, together with interest thereon as provided herein. 
 64 

(vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii) , the L/C Issuer
shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to
the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender
pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in the relevant Committed Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A
certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (d) Repayment of Participations . 
 (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Borrower and has
received from any Lender such Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c) , if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the
related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of such Borrower s Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will
distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to
 Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by
such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 2.03(d)(ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement. 
 65 

(e) Obligations Absolute . The obligation of each Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for
each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued for its account and to repay each L/C Borrowing in respect of each such Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter
of Credit, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or
other right that such Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
 (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
 (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee
for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver, interim receiver, receiver/manager or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding
under any Debtor Relief Law; (v) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant
Alternative Currency to such Borrower or in the relevant currency markets generally; or (vi) any other circumstance or
happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, such Borrower. 
 Each Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit issued for its account and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it
and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with such Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, such Borrower will promptly notify the L/C Issuer. Such Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C
Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. (f) Role of L/C Issuer . Each Lender and each Borrower
agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by
such Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such 
 66 

document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender
for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower; provided , however , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude such Borrower s pursuing such
rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of
the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 2.03(e)(i) through (vi); provided , however , that anything in Section 2.03(e)(i) through
(vi) to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to such Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or
exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower which were caused by the L/C Issuer s willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence, or the L/C Issuer s willful failure to pay under any such Letter of Credit after the presentation to it
by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to
be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
 (g) Applicability of ISP . Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and a Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued for the
account of such Borrower, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each such Letter of Credit. (h) Letter of Credit Fees . Each Borrower
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage of the Primary Tranche, in Dollars, a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee for each Letter of Credit
issued for the account of such Borrower equal to the Applicable Rate times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit; provided , however , any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for
the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender or such Borrower has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall
be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Applicable Percentages of the Primary Tranche allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to
 Section 2.18(a)(iv) , with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the L/C Issuer for its own account. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such
Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.09 . Letter of Credit Fees shall be (A) due and payable on the fifth (5 th Business Day following
the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration 
 67 

Date and thereafter on demand and (B) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a year consisting of 360 days. If there is any change in

2.04 Joint and Several Liability. 
 Each Borrower acknowledges, agrees, represents and warrants the following: 
 (a) Inducement . The Lenders have been induced to make the Loans to, and the L/C Issuer has been induced to issue Letters of Credit for
the account of the Borrowers, in part based upon the assurances by each Borrower that each Borrower desires that all Obligations under the Loan Documents be honored and enforced as separate obligations of each Borrower, should the Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, desire to do so in accordance with the terms hereof. (b) Combined Liability .
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 2.05(b)(ii) and Section 10.21 , (i) the Borrowers shall be jointly and severally liable to the Secured Parties for all representations, warranties,

Borrower s Obligations without enforcing any other Borrower s Obligations and vice versa . Any failure or inability of the Administrative Agent to enforce one or more Borrower s Obligations shall not in any way limit the
Administrative Agent s right to enforce the Obligations of the other Borrowers. If the Administrative Agent forecloses or exercises similar remedies under any one or more Loan Documents, then such foreclosure or similar remedy shall be deemed
to reduce the balance of the Loans only to the extent of the cash proceeds actually realized by the Secured Parties from such foreclosure or similar remedy or, if applicable, the Administrative Agent s credit bid at such sale, regardless of the
effect of such foreclosure or similar remedy on the Loans secured by such Loan Documents under the applicable state or other applicable Law.

Commitments then in effect or (B) the Total Outstandings that constitute Temporary Increase Loans for any Temporary Increase Tranche plus the aggregate FX Reserve Amount with respect to such Temporary Increase Loans exceed the aggregate
Temporary Increase Commitments of the Temporary Increase Lenders participating in such Temporary Increase Tranche (any occurrence under clauses (A) or (B) of this Section 2.05(b)(i) , an Excess

made); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, solely during the continuance of a Cash Sweep Event, so long as no Event of Default or Default pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or 8.01(g) has occurred and is
continuing or would be triggered after giving pro forma effect thereto, the Primary Borrowers may reserve amounts for Permitted Payments that the Primary Borrowers project in good faith to pay during the applicable calendar quarter;
 provided , further , that (x) any Gross Distributions with respect to a Portfolio Investment that are so identified in writing by the applicable Primary Borrower to the Administrative Agent shall first be applied to any outstanding
Credit Extensions related to such Portfolio Investment, and only if any excess remains after such Credit Extensions are repaid in full, shall such Gross Distributions be applied to any Credit Extensions related to other Portfolio Investments and
(y) the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to apply such amounts in the manner set forth above to the extent (1) such Gross Distributions are not so identified by such Primary Borrower or (2) such application would result
in any Lender receiving more than its Applicable Percentage of the then due and payable Obligations (pursuant to the repayment of Temporary Increase Loans or otherwise). 
 (iii) Upon the occurrence of a Sweep LTV Ratio Event, the Borrowers shall prepay outstanding Loans (including any Temporary
Increase Loans, as applicable) and L/C Borrowings by the Required Payment Time in an aggregate amount sufficient to decrease the LTV Ratio to a percentage that is equal to or less than the Advance Rate. Subject to
 Section 7.10(a) , any failure by the Borrowers to make such payment by the Required Payment Time shall result in a Cash Sweep Event and not result in an Event of Default.

apply the same ratably to the accrued and unpaid Obligations in accordance with Section 8.03 , until such time as the payment obligations of this Section 2.05(b) have been satisfied in full. 
 71 

2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. 
 The Initial Primary Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time
permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments, including by reducing any Temporary Increase Commitment; provided that (a) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. four (4) Business Days
prior to the date of termination or reduction, (b) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of 5,000,000 or any whole multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such other amounts as agreed by the Administrative Agent), (c)

hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date
specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by any Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans made to it denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on
the dates specified herein. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative
Currency payment amount. So long as no Event of Default, Cash Sweep Period or Potential Cash Sweep Event is continuing, each payment made by a Borrower hereunder shall be credited against the Obligations as directed by such Borrower, provided 
that each such payment (other than prepayments) by a Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans then due (including any Temporary Increase Loans) shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective
principal amounts of their outstanding Loans then due (including pro rata among the applicable Temporary Increase Lenders with respect to any Temporary Increase Loans). The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its applicable
share of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable
Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to
be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
 76 

(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Daily Simple RFR Loans in Dollars,
prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Daily Simple RFR Loans in Dollars, that such Lender has made such share available in
accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its
share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by
the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender s share of such Committed Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after the date such amount is
made available to such Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Borrower upon demand, by the Required Payment Time, such amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon at the interest rate applicable to Base
Rate Committed Loans. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such
Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment
by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to
the date on which any payment is due from such Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has
made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then
each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day
from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the applicable Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this
 Section 2.12(b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent .
If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to such Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as
received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
 77 

(d) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation
or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c) . 
 (e) Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or
manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. 
 If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest
on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest
thereon greater than its Applicable Percentage thereof as provided herein (for the avoidance of doubt, except as a result of such Lender s participation in a Temporary Increase Tranche that causes the Total Outstandings hereunder to be
allocated in proportion other than as a pro rata share of the Aggregate Commitments), then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing to them, provided that: 
 (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
 (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made
by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in
L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall apply). 
 78 

Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the foregoing shall not
require the sharing of the proceeds of any credit insurance policy, credit default swap or similar instrument obtained by any Lender. 
 2.14 Additional Primary Borrowers. 
 (a) At any time, upon not less than five (5) Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be
agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), the Initial Primary Borrower may designate any Alternative Investment Vehicle or Parallel Fund (each, an Applicant Primary Borrower as an Additional Primary Borrower to
receive Loans hereunder and to have Letters of Credit issued for its account by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and agreement in substantially the form
of Exhibit F (an Additional Primary Borrower Joinder Agreement ). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Applicant Primary Borrower becoming entitled to utilize the credit facilities provided for herein
such Applicant Primary Borrower must (A) be approved as an Additional Primary Borrower by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; (B) if such Applicant Primary Borrower qualifies as a legal entity customer under
the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, the Administrative Agent shall have received, sufficiently in advance of (but in any event not less than three (3) Business Days prior to) the date such Applicant Primary Borrower becomes an Additional
Primary Borrower, a Beneficial Ownership Certification in relation to such Applicant Primary Borrower; and (C) deliver to the Administrative Agent duly executed documentation substantially similar, in the reasonable discretion of the
Administrative Agent, to that executed by the Primary Borrowers on the Closing Date, including all items required to make such Applicant Primary Borrower KYC Compliant, legal opinions, Organization Documents, an ERISA Certificate, a Collateral
Account Pledge Agreement and such other Loan Documents and filings as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, under which such Applicant Primary Borrower will grant to the Administrative Agent a security interest in the Collateral Account
(if any) into which any Distributions related to Portfolio Investments are due to be paid. The Administrative Agent may waive, in its sole discretion, the requirement in this Section 2.14(a) that an Applicant Primary
Borrower that is an Alternative Investment Vehicle deliver a legal opinion; provided , however , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no legal opinion will be required to be delivered in respect of any Applicant Primary Borrower that is
an Alternative Investment Vehicle to the extent that (i) another Alternative Investment Vehicle is at that time an existing Primary Borrower and is incorporated, formed or otherwise organized in the same jurisdiction as such Applicant Primary
Borrower, (ii) is the same type of entity (e.g., a limited partnership or a limited liability company) as such Applicant Primary Borrower, (iii) a legal opinion has been delivered in respect of such existing Primary Borrower no earlier
than the date that is two (2) years (or such earlier date as determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) prior to the date such Applicant Primary Borrower joins this Agreement; provided that there has been no change in
law with respect to the relevant jurisdiction that would alter the analysis of the prior opinion, as determined by the 
 79 

Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion and (iv) the corporate structure, authorizing resolutions and Partnership Agreement, in each case, of such Applicant Primary Borrower are
substantially similar to that of such existing Primary Borrower, in the Administrative Agent s reasonable discretion. Upon the satisfaction of the requirements of this Section 2.14(a) , such Applicant Primary Borrower
shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a Primary Borrower hereunder. (b) The Obligations of each Additional
Primary Borrower shall be joint and several with the Obligations of each other Borrower in accordance with Section 2.04 . 
 (c) Each Additional Primary Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Initial Primary Borrower as its agent for all purposes relevant to this
Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices, (ii) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto and
(iii) unless otherwise provided in the applicable notice of borrowing, the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the Lenders to any such Additional Primary Borrower hereunder. Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification or
other action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by each Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by the Initial Primary Borrower, whether or not any such other
Borrower joins therein. Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgment, direction, certification or other communication delivered to the Initial Primary Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been delivered to
such Additional Primary Borrower(s). 2.15 Extension of Maturity Date. 
 (a) Voluntary Extension Option . 
 (i) The Initial Primary Borrower may, no more than one (1) time, subject to the satisfactions of the conditions specified
in Section 2.15(c) below, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders) not earlier than ninety (90) days and not later than thirty (30) days prior to the Existing Maturity Date (or
as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent), request that each Lender extend such Lender s Maturity Date with respect to all or a portion of such Lender s Commitment in the Primary Tranche for an additional term of not longer than 364
days from the Existing Maturity Date (the Voluntary Extension Option provided that, at the time the Initial Primary Borrower makes such a request, the Administrative Agent shall have the option, in its reasonable
discretion, and the applicable Lenders shall have the option, in their sole discretion, to consent to the Voluntary Extension Option. 
 (ii) With respect to the Voluntary Extension Option, each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by
notice to the Administrative Agent, given not earlier than seventy-five (75) days prior to the Existing Maturity Date (or as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent) and not later than the date (the Notice Date that is
twenty (20) days prior to the Existing Maturity Date (or as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent), 
 80 

advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date, a
 Non-Extending Lender promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the
Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree. 
 (iii) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Initial Primary Borrower of each Lender s determination under this
 Section 2.15(a) with respect to the Voluntary Extension Option no later than the date fifteen (15) days prior to the Existing Maturity Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).
 (b) Extension . To the extent the Administrative Agent has approved the Voluntary Extension Option and certain Lenders have agreed
to extend their Maturity Date with respect to the Voluntary Extension Option (each, an Extending Lender ), then the Commitment of each such Extending Lender shall be extended to such date falling no more than 364 days after the
Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day). Subject to Section 2.15(d) , to the extent the Commitments of the
Extending Lenders are less than the Aggregate Commitments in effect prior to such extension, the Extending Lenders may provide additional Commitments and one or more other financial institutions or entities (each such other financial institution
entity, an Additional Commitment Lender may provide additional Commitments provided that each such Additional Commitment Lender shall be subject to the written approval of the Initial Primary Borrower, the L/C Issuer and
the Administrative Agent (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld) and such Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement) and, to the extent the aggregate additional Commitments
of such Extending Lenders and Additional Commitment Lenders exceed such Aggregate Commitments, such Commitments shall be allocated in the manner requested by the Initial Primary Borrower. 
 (c) Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions . As a condition precedent to the Voluntary Extension Option, the Borrowers shall pay (or
cause to be paid), for the benefit of each Extending Lender, an extension fee in an amount to be agreed by the Initial Primary Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Extending Lender and the Initial Primary Borrower shall deliver (i) to
the Administrative Agent an Extension Request signed by a Responsible Officer of the Initial Primary Borrower (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by or on behalf of each Borrower approving or consenting to such extension and
(B) certifying on behalf of the Initial Primary Borrower and the applicable Subsidiary Pledgor that, before and immediately after giving effect to such extension, (1) the representations and warranties of each Borrower and such Subsidiary
Pledgor contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents to which such Person is party shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Existing Maturity Date, except (I) to the extent that such representations and
warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and (II) for purposes of this Section 2.15 , the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 5.11 and 5.15 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Section 6.01 , (2) no Default, Event of Default, Cash Sweep Period or Potential Cash Sweep Event
exists and (3) the 
 81 

LTV Ratio shall be less than or equal to the Advance Rate and (ii) to the Lenders a new or updated Beneficial Ownership Certification, as applicable, in relation to each Borrower that
qualifies as a legal entity customer under the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, if so requested by any Lender prior to the effectiveness of any extension to the Maturity Date. In addition, on the Maturity Date of each Non-Extending Lender, each Borrower shall prepay any Committed Loans made to it by such Non-Extending Lender that are outstanding on such date. 
 (d) Conflicting Provisions . This Section 2.15 shall supersede any provisions in
 Section 2.13 or Section 10.01 to the contrary. Notwithstanding anything herein, (i) if any Lenders consent to the Voluntary Extension Option, the exercise thereof shall then be at the Initial
Primary Borrower s sole discretion, (ii) if any Lender does not consent to such extension, the Initial Primary Borrower shall at such time have the option to reduce the Commitments for the extended period by the amount of such Non-Extending Lender s Commitment or to direct such Non-Extending Lender to assign its Commitment to a replacement Lender in accordance with
 Section 10.06(b) , or any combination of the foregoing and (iii) no legal opinion shall be required as a condition to the effectiveness of any extension pursuant to this Section 2.15 . 
 (e) Reallocation Following Voluntary Extension . On the Existing Maturity Date with respect to the Voluntary Extension Option, the
Administrative Agent will reallocate the Total Outstandings hereunder (including any Loans made by any Extending Lender or Additional Commitment Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 ), in each case, at par, such that, after
giving effect thereto, the ratio of each Lender s (including each Extending Lender s or Additional Commitment Lender s) share of the Total Outstandings is equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Committed Loans after giving effect
to the Voluntary Extension Option. For the avoidance of doubt, such reallocation may require the reallocation of Loans from an Extending Lender to another Extending Lender or Additional Commitment Lender, in each case, at par. In connection with any
such reallocation of the outstanding Loans, (i) the Administrative Agent will give advance notice sufficient to comply with the applicable timing period in Section 2.02 to each Lender that is required to fund any
amount or receive any partial repayment in connection therewith and (ii) the applicable Lender or Lenders will fund such amounts up to their respective shares of the Outstanding Amounts being reallocated and the Administrative Agent shall remit
to any applicable Lender its applicable portion of such funded amount if necessary to give effect to the reallocation of such Outstanding Amounts. In connection with such repayment made with respect to any such reallocation pursuant to an Additional
Commitment Lender joining this Agreement (to the extent such repayment is required), the applicable Borrowers shall pay (A) all interest due on the amount repaid to the date of repayment on the immediately following Interest Payment Date and
(B) any amounts due pursuant to Section 3.06 as a result of such reallocation occurring on any date other than an Interest Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) no Temporary Increase Loan shall be
reallocated as provided in this Section 2.15(e) and (y) in the event any condition precedent (including Section 2.15(c)(i)(B)(2) is not satisfied as of the Existing Maturity Date, the Total
Outstandings hereunder shall not be reallocated. 
 82 

2.16 Temporary Increase, Allocations and Repayments. 
 (a) Request for Temporary Increase . Provided there exists no Default, Event of Default, Cash Sweep Period or Potential Cash Sweep Event,
and subject to compliance with the terms of this Section 2.16 , the Initial Primary Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, request the creation of a Temporary Increase Tranche by delivery of a draft Temporary
Increase Request to the Administrative Agent at least five (5) Business Days (or such shorter period as the Initial Primary Borrower and any Temporary Increase Lender may agree) prior to the proposed effective date of such Temporary Increase
Tranche. Each Temporary Increase Tranche shall increase the Aggregate Commitments by a corresponding amount during the pendency of such Temporary Increase Tranche. With respect to each Temporary Increase Tranche, the related Temporary Increase
Request shall state: (i) the chronological number of such Temporary Increase Tranche (i.e., Temporary Increase Tranche No. 1, Temporary Increase Tranche No. 2, etc.), so as to enable appropriate tracking and allocation by the
Administrative Agent and Borrowers of Temporary Increase Loans and repayments to the correct Temporary Increase Lenders; (ii) the aggregate Temporary Increase Commitment for such Temporary Increase Tranche; (iii) the applicable Temporary
Increase Lenders and their individual Temporary Increase Commitments and related Applicable Percentages, each of which Temporary Increase Lenders must sign the Temporary Increase Request to confirm their agreement to participate in such Temporary
Increase Tranche; and (iv) the Temporary Increase Stated Maturity Date; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, an additional Lender or additional Lenders may provide all or a portion of the Temporary Increase Commitment for any such
Temporary Increase Tranche. There may be up to five (5) Temporary Increase Tranches outstanding at any one time (or such greater number as the Joint Lead Arrangers may agree in writing). Each Lender requested by the Initial Primary Borrower to
participate in a Temporary Increase Tranche can elect to participate or not in such Temporary Increase Tranche in such Lender s sole discretion. No Letters of Credit shall be issued under a Temporary Increase Tranche. 
 (b) Effective Date . The Administrative Agent and the Initial Primary Borrower shall determine the effective date of any Temporary
Increase Tranche, which shall be a Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Initial Primary Borrower and the Lenders of the creation of each Temporary Increase Tranche. 
 (c) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase . The following are conditions precedent to the creation of each Temporary Increase Tranche:
 (i) The Initial Primary Borrower shall, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date for such
Temporary Increase Tranche (or such shorter period reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), deliver to the Administrative Agent a fully executed Temporary Increase Request, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Initial Primary Borrower
certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by or on behalf of each Borrower approving or consenting to such increase; 
 (ii) On or prior to the proposed effective date of such Temporary Increase Tranche, the Borrowers shall have paid to the
Administrative Agent (A) for the benefit of each Temporary Increase Lender, an upfront fee in an amount to be agreed to by the Initial Primary Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Temporary Increase Lender, and (B) all other fees
due and owing hereunder or under any other Loan Document; 
 83 

(iii) The Joint Lead Arrangers shall have consented in their reasonable
discretion to such Temporary Increase Tranche, such consent to be evidenced by their signatures on the Temporary Increase Request; 
 (iv) An existing Lender or additional Lender shall have agreed in its sole discretion to be a Temporary Increase Lender in such
Temporary Increase Tranche, evidenced by its signature on the Temporary Increase Request; (v) If applicable, the Borrowers
shall execute replacement Notes reflecting the increase; and (vi) Assuming Total Outstandings equal the Aggregate
Commitments (after giving pro forma effect to the increase in the Aggregate Commitments pursuant to such Temporary Increase Tranche), no Sweep LTV Ratio Event would occur or be continuing unless consented to in writing by the Joint Lead
Arrangers, in their sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each existing Lender shall have a right of first
refusal to provide its Applicable Percentage (not giving effect to any other Temporary Increase Tranche) of any Temporary Increase Tranche before additional Commitments are accepted from a new Lender or an existing Lender in excess of its Applicable
Percentage (not giving effect to any other Temporary Increase Tranche); provided , in each case, a Lender shall be deemed to have waived its right of first refusal, if (x) such Lender does not approve (such approval may be subject to such
Lender s credit or similar approval) such request for additional Commitments within three (3) Business Days following delivery of notice thereof by the Initial Primary Borrower or (y) such Lender does not commit to provide such
additional Commitments within ten (10) Business Days following delivery of notice thereof by the Initial Primary Borrower. To the extent one or more existing Lenders do not participate in such Temporary Increase Tranche (including as a result
of a Lender not obtaining credit or similar approval within the timing set forth above), each other existing Lender that elects to participate in such Temporary Increase Tranche shall have a preemptive right to provide such additional Commitments in
excess of its Applicable Percentage (not giving effect to any other Temporary Increase Tranche) prior to any additional Commitments being allocated to any new Lender (it being understood that any Temporary Increase Tranche shall be allocated among
existing Lenders on a pro rata basis (based off existing Commitments (giving effect to each other Temporary Increase Tranche)) to the extent possible); provided , such existing Lender shall be deemed to have waived its preemptive right, if
such Lender does not commit to provide such additional Commitments within one (1) Business Day following delivery of notice thereof by the Initial Primary Borrower. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, (A) subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, a Temporary Increase Tranche may be provided by the
existing Lender(s) on a nonratable basis to their respective Commitment(s) and (B) no legal opinion shall be required as a condition to the effectiveness of any Temporary Increase Tranche. On the effective date of each Temporary Increase
Tranche, Schedule II shall be automatically updated to reflect any corresponding increase in any Lender s Commitment in such Temporary Increase Tranche and/or the Commitment of any additional Lender. 
 84 

(d) Temporary Increase Loan Borrowings . At any time a Temporary Increase Tranche is in
effect, and from time to time, any Borrower may request that a Loan be funded as a Temporary Increase Loan by noting such in the related Committed Loan Notice delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with
 Section 2.02(a) . Temporary Increase Loans shall be Loans and part of the Obligations in all respects, other than with respect to the Lenders funding obligations and ratable participations with respect thereto as set
forth in this Section 2.16 . Temporary Increase Loans will be secured by the Collateral in the same manner and to the same extent as all other Loans and will be pari passu with all other Loans in all respects.
Provided that all applicable conditions precedent for a Loan in Sections 2.01 and 4.02 have been satisfied, the Temporary Increase Lenders in the applicable Temporary Increase Tranche will exclusively fund pro rata based on their
respective Temporary Increase Commitments in such Temporary Increase Tranche, at any time and from time to time, Temporary Increase Loans requested by a Borrower in accordance with Section 2.02(a) ; provided that,
after giving effect to such Temporary Increase Loan, (i) all conditions precedent for a Loan hereunder have been satisfied; (ii) the aggregate Temporary Increase Loans in the related Temporary Increase Tranche would not exceed the
aggregate Temporary Increase Commitment of such Temporary Increase Tranche; and (iii) the aggregate Temporary Increase Loans across all Temporary Increase Tranches would not exceed the aggregate Temporary Increase Commitment for all Temporary
Increase Tranches. No Lender other than the Temporary Increase Lenders participating in the applicable Temporary Increase Tranche will have any right or duty to fund Temporary Increase Loans with respect to such Temporary Increase Tranche. As a
result of such exclusive participation in a Temporary Increase Tranche, the Total Outstandings may from time to time during the term of any Temporary Increase Tranche be allocated amongst the Lenders in proportions other than their pro rata share of
the Aggregate Commitments. (e) Temporary Increase Maturity Date . The unpaid principal amount of the Obligations with respect to
Temporary Increase Loans made in respect of any Temporary Increase Tranche that are outstanding on the applicable Temporary Increase Maturity Date, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable on the applicable
Temporary Increase Maturity Date. (f) Temporary Increase Loan Repayments . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, so long
as no Event of Default, Cash Sweep Period or Potential Cash Sweep Event has occurred and is continuing, all repayments of Outstanding Amounts and payments of interest, fees and other amounts from the Borrowers shall be applied to Temporary Increase
Loans or Loans other than Temporary Increase Loans as directed by the Borrowers in their sole discretion (and the Administrative Agent shall in turn apply such repayments and payments in accordance with such direction from the Borrowers). If an
Event of Default, Cash Sweep Period or Potential Cash Sweep Event has occurred and is continuing at any time when there are Obligations outstanding related to Temporary Increase Loans, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all payments
made on the Obligations shall be credited, to the extent of the amount thereof, to the Lenders in accordance with their pro rata share of Total Outstandings at the time of such repayment (i.e., ratably between Temporary Increase Loans or Loans other
than Temporary Increase Loans based on amounts due without regard to the pro rata share of the Commitment of each Lender). 
 85 

(g) Temporary Increase Loans Generally . Except as otherwise stated in this
 Section 2.16 , Temporary Increase Loans shall be subject to all applicable provisions of this Agreement with respect to Loans generally to the extent applicable, other than pricing. 
 2.17 Cash Collateral. 
 (a) Certain Credit Support Events . Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored
any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Borrower and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation of a Borrower for
any reason remains outstanding, such Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all its L/C Obligations. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, promptly upon the request of the
Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, the applicable Borrower shall deliver Cash Collateral to the Administrative Agent in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv) 
and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued for its account. (b) Grant of
Security Interest . All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) provided by a Borrower shall be maintained in a blocked, interest-bearing deposit account at Wells Fargo (or another Eligible
Institution approved by the L/C Issuer). Such Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer
and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest (subject to any Permitted Liens) in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all
proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations of such Borrower to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.17(c) . If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash
Collateral provided by a Borrower is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure of such Borrower
secured thereby, such Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. 
 (c) Application . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this
 Section 2.17 or Sections 2.03 , 2.18 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of a Borrower shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations of such
Borrower, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other
application of such property as may be provided for herein. 
 86 

(d) Release . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided by a Borrower
to reduce its Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status
of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vi) )) or (ii) the Administrative Agent s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral;
 provided , however , (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Borrower shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default (and following application as provided in this
 Section 2.17 may be otherwise applied in accordance with Section 8.03 ), and (y) the Borrower providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released
but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations of such Borrower. 2.18 Defaulting Lenders. 
 (a) Adjustments . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
 (i) Waivers and Amendments . That Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 10.01 . (ii)
 Reallocation of Payments . Any payment by a Borrower of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article
VIII or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 ), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative
Agent as follows: first , to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer
hereunder; third , if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the L/C Issuer, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit issued for the
account of such Borrower; fourth , as such Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan to such Borrower in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof
as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and such Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and
released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans to such Borrower under this Agreement; sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer as a result of any judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the L/C Issuer against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh , so long as no Event of Default exists, to the
payment of any amounts owing to such Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this
Agreement; and eighth , to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is 
 87 

a payment of the principal amount of any Loans made to such Borrower or L/C Borrowings of such Borrower in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and
(y) such Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay such Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any such Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to
a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and
each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. (iii) Certain Fees . That Defaulting Lender (A) shall not be entitled
to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and no Borrower shall be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have
been paid to that Defaulting Lender), but only to the extent allocable to the sum of (1) the Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans funded by it and (2) its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it
has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.17 , or Section 2.18(a)(ii) , as applicable (and the applicable Borrower shall (I) be required to pay to the L/C Issuer the amount of such fee
allocable to its Fronting Exposure arising from that Defaulting Lender and (II) not be required to pay the remaining amount of such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (B) shall be
limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.03(h) . (iv)
 Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure . During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting 
Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.03 , the Applicable Percentage of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be
computed without giving effect to the Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided that (A) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Event of Default
exists; and (B) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the
Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of that Lender. 
 (b) Defaulting Lender Cure . If the Initial Primary Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer agree in writing in their sole
discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth
therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may
determine to be necessary to cause the 
 88 

Committed Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to
 Section 2.18(a)(iv) ), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of any Borrower
while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of
any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 2.19 Increase in Commitments. 
 (a) Request for Revolving Increase . Provided there exists no Default, Event of Default, Cash Sweep Period or Potential Cash
Sweep Event, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Initial Primary Borrower may from time to time request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments (excluding any Temporary Increase Commitments);
 provided that (A) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of 5,000,000 (or such other amount as agreed by the Administrative Agent) and (B) the Initial Primary Borrower may make, at any time after the Closing
Date, a maximum of six (6) such requests (or such greater number as the Administrative Agent may agree in writing) prior to the Maturity Date. At the time of sending such notice, the Initial Primary Borrower (in consultation with the

be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and (y) for purposes of this Section 2.19 , the representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.11 and 5.15 shall be deemed to
refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Section 6.01 , (2) no Default, Event of Default, Cash Sweep Period or Potential Cash Sweep Event exists and (3) assuming Total Outstandings equal the Aggregate

case, to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans ratably allocated with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section 2.19 , except as
otherwise requested by the Initial Primary Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(f)(B) and with respect to any Temporary Increase Tranche. For the avoidance of doubt, no legal opinion shall be required as a condition to the
effectiveness of any increase under this Section 2.19 . (f) Conflicting Provisions . This
 Section 2.19 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.13 or Section 10.01 to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) except as otherwise expressly provided

Primary Borrower may request any such increase in the Aggregate Commitments be provided by the existing Lender(s) on a nonratable basis to their respective Commitment(s) and (C) no Lender shall be required to participate in any such increase.

the ratio of each Lender s (including each new or increasing Lender s) share of outstanding Loans and participations in Letters of Credit to its share of the Commitments is the same as that of each other Lender. For the avoidance of doubt,
such 
 90 

reallocation may require the reallocation of Loans from an existing Lender to a new or increasing Lender, in each case, at par. In connection with any such reallocation of the outstanding Loans,
(x) the Administrative Agent will give advance notice sufficient to comply with the applicable timing period in Section 2.02 to each Lender that is required to fund any amount or receive any partial repayment in
connection therewith and (y) the applicable Lender or Lenders will fund such amounts up to their respective shares of the Loans being reallocated and the Administrative Agent shall remit to any applicable Lender its applicable portion of such

applicable Borrowers shall pay (A) all interest due on the amount repaid to the date of repayment on the immediately following Interest Payment Date and (B) any amounts due pursuant to Section 3.06 as a result of
such reallocation occurring on any date other than an Interest Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt, no Temporary Increase Loan shall be reallocated as provided in this Section 2.19(g) . 
 2.20 Qualified Borrowers and Borrower Guaranties. 
 (a) At any time, upon not less than five (5) Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be

formed or organized, as applicable, in a jurisdiction in which any Lender is unlicensed or unauthorized to lend, provided that such Lender agrees, upon request of such Applicant Qualified Borrower, to use reasonable efforts (subject to any
internal policies or procedures generally applicable to such Lender) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate its inability to lend if such change, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, is not disadvantageous to such
Lender; (B) such Applicant Qualified Borrower must be owned, directly or indirectly, by a Primary Borrower, or an entity through which such Primary Borrower may acquire a Portfolio Investment, the Indebtedness of which can be guaranteed by such
Primary Borrower pursuant to the terms of its Organization Documents; (C) if such Applicant Qualified Borrower qualifies as a legal entity customer under the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, the Administrative Agent shall have
received, sufficiently in advance of (but in any event not less than three (3) Business Days prior to) the date such Applicant Qualified Borrower becomes a Qualified Borrower, a Beneficial Ownership Certification in relation to such Applicant
Qualified Borrower; and (D) the Administrative Agent shall have received (1) an unconditional guaranty of payment from the applicable Primary Borrower, substantially in the form of Exhibit K (a Borrower Guaranty ,

 91 

of which is guaranteed by the applicable Primary Borrower pursuant to a Borrower Guaranty, and (3) duly executed documentation of such Applicant Qualified Borrower and the applicable Primary
Borrower, substantially similar, in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, to that executed by the Primary Borrowers on the Closing Date, including all items required to make such Applicant Qualified Borrower KYC Compliant, legal
opinions, Organization Documents, an ERISA Certificate, and such other Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request. Upon the satisfaction of the requirements of this Section 2.20(a) , such Applicant
Qualified Borrower shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a Qualified Borrower hereunder. (b) Each Qualified
Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Initial Primary Borrower as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices, (ii) the execution and
delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto, and (iii) unless otherwise provided in the applicable notice of borrowing, the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the Lenders to

directly to the Lenders, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to any Obligations due and owing by a Qualified Borrower and guaranteed by such Primary Borrower under a Borrower Guaranty, together with all interest, reasonable costs and
expenses and fees due to the Lenders pursuant thereto, as a Committed Borrowing hereunder by such Primary Borrower, in the event the Administrative Agent shall have not received payment of such Obligations when due. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify such Primary Borrower of any disbursement made to the Lenders pursuant to the terms hereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such disbursement, and the Administrative Agent shall
provide the Lenders with notice thereof. Any such disbursement made by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders shall be deemed to be a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.02 in the amount so paid, and such Primary Borrower
shall be deemed to have given to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 2.02 a Committed Loan Notice with respect thereto; and such disbursements shall be made without regard to the
minimum amount specified in Section 2.02 . The Administrative Agent may conclusively rely on the Lenders as to the amount of any such Obligations due to the Lenders, absent manifest error.

the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion), terminate such Qualified Borrower s status as such, provided that, as of the effective date of such termination, such
Qualified Borrower has no outstanding Loans or Letters of Credit, or other amounts payable on account of any Loans made to it or Letters of Credit issued for its benefit. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such
termination of a Qualified Borrower s status.

ARTICLE III 
 TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
 3.01 Taxes. (a)
 Non-Excluded Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the respective Borrowers under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
present or future Taxes with respect thereto, unless required by Law. If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any Laws to deduct or withhold any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to or for
the account of a Tax Indemnified Party: (i) in the event that such Borrower or the Administrative Agent is required to deduct or withhold Non-Excluded Taxes, the sum payable by such Borrower shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01 ), such Tax Indemnified Party receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings of Non-Excluded Taxes been made, (ii) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall make such deductions or
withholdings of Taxes; and (iii) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws. 
 (b) Notice of Non-Excluded Taxes . The Borrowers shall promptly, upon becoming aware that any
Borrower must deduct or withhold any Tax on a payment under a Loan Document (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax required to be deducted or withheld), notify the Administrative Agent accordingly. Similarly, any other Tax
Indemnified Party shall notify the Administrative Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to such Tax Indemnified Party. If the Administrative Agent receives such notification (i) from a Tax Indemnified Party, it shall notify
the Borrowers and (ii) from a Borrower, it shall notify the applicable Tax Indemnified Party. (c) Other Taxes . Without
duplication or limitation of amounts paid under Section 3.01(a) , each Borrower agrees to pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely
reimburse it for the payment of, any and all present and future stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, stamp duty land tax, court or documentary, intangible, recording, or filing taxes and any similar excise or property taxes or charges or similar
levies or penalties that arise from any payment made by it under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect
to, any Loan Document to which it is a party (hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes provided that the Borrowers shall not be responsible hereunder to pay any such Other Taxes resulting from any non-exempt prohibited transaction under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code arising as a result of the use by any Lender of plan assets with the meaning of the Plan Asset Regulations in
connection with the transactions contemplated under the Loan Documents or such Other Taxes 
 93 

that are Other Connection Taxes imposed with respect to an assignment (other than an assignment made pursuant to Section 3.07(b) ), or any cost, loss or liability
incurred in relation to Luxembourg stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes which arises in respect of any registration of or other action on any Loan Documents by any Lender or L/C Issuer when such registration or action is or was not
(i) mandatory and (ii) required to enforce the rights of any Lender or L/C Issuer under the Loan Documents. (d)
 Indemnification . (i) The Borrowers agree to indemnify each Tax Indemnified Party for (A) the full amount of Non-Excluded Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment made under any Loan Document and Other Taxes (including any such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.01 ), in each case payable or paid by such Tax Indemnified Party or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Tax Indemnified Party and
any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, and (B) any liability (including penalties, interest or expenses, including legal expenses incurred in the enforcement of this Agreement against the Administrative Agent or the
Borrowers, but excluding any penalties, interest or expenses attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Tax Indemnified Party or any of their Affiliates) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not
such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment under this Section 3.01(d) shall be made within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date the applicable Tax Indemnified Party makes a demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Borrower by any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of any Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Nothing in this Section 3.01(d) shall require the Borrowers to indemnify the Tax Indemnified Parties to
the extent that the Non-Excluded Taxes, Other Taxes or liabilities are or will be compensated for under Section 3.01(a) . 
 (ii) Each Tax Indemnified Party (other than the Administrative Agent) shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent within
fifteen (15) Business Days after demand therefor, for (A) any Taxes attributable to such Tax Indemnified Party s failure to comply with the provision of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a
Participant Register, (B) any Non-Excluded Taxes attributable to such Tax Indemnified Party (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Non-Excluded Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), and (C) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Tax Indemnified Party, in each case, that are payable or paid by the
Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and reasonable expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent)
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the relevant Governmental Authority, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
 
 94 

certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any such Tax Indemnified Party by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Tax Indemnified
Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Tax Indemnified Party under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to such Tax Indemnified Party from any
other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 3.01(d)(ii). (e)
 Prescribed Forms . (i) Each Lender, on or prior to the date on which such Person becomes a Lender hereunder (and
from time to time thereafter upon the request of a Borrower or the Administrative Agent), shall deliver, but only to the extent that such Lender is legally entitled to do so, to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent two (2) duly completed
copies of (A) IRS Form W-9 or applicable successor form, (B) IRS Form W-8BEN, 
 W-8BEN-E, or applicable successor form, (I) claiming eligibility of such Lender for a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the benefits
of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, or (II) accompanied by a certificate for the portfolio interest rule of Section 881(c) of the Code, stating that such Lender is not (x) a bank 
within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (y) a 10 percent shareholder of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (z) a controlled foreign corporation receiving
interest from a related Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, (C) IRS Form W-8ECI, or an applicable successor form, (D) IRS Form
 W-8IMY, or any applicable successor form, evidencing a complete exemption from U.S. withholding Tax, or (E) or such other documentary evidence satisfactory to Borrowers and the Administrative Agent that
such Lender is entitled to a complete exemption from U.S. withholding Tax, provided , however , that an assignee Lender shall not be treated as failing to comply with this Section 3.01(e) to the extent that
payments to the assignor Lender under any Loan Document were subject to the deduction or withholding of Non-Excluded Taxes. 
 (ii) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any
Loan Document shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and duly executed documentation reasonably requested
by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall
deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup
withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
 Section 3.01(e)(i)(A) through (D) shall not be required if in such Lender s judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 95 

(iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable, or any
intergovernmental agreements (or related legislation or official administrative rules or practices) entered into in connection with the implementation of Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, in each
case, as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations thereunder or to determine the amount to deduct
and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 3.01(e)(iii) , FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date. 
 If any form or certification previously delivered by a Lender expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, the Lender shall
update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 (f) Evidence of Payment . Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes under a Loan Document by any
Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or such other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (g) Tax Refunds . Each Tax Indemnified Party agrees that if such Person
determines that it, or the tax consolidation group to which it participates, subsequently recovers or receives a refund of any Taxes attributable to a Tax Payment by any Borrower, such Person shall promptly pay such Borrower an amount equal to such
refund (but only to the extent of the Tax Payment made with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund) net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such
Person and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) related thereto; provided that if, due to subsequent adjustment of such refund, such Person is required to repay
such amount to the relevant Governmental Authorities, such Borrower agrees to repay such Person, as the case may be, the amount required to be repaid, plus any interest, penalties or other charges imposed by the Governmental Authority in
respect thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(g) , in no event will any Tax Indemnified Party be required to pay any amount to a Borrower pursuant to this
 Section 3.01(g) the payment of which would place such Tax Indemnified Party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Person would have been in if the Tax subject to
indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the Tax Payment had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Tax Indemnified Party to make available its Tax returns
(or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person. 
 96 

3.02 Illegality. 
 If any Lender reasonably determines that any applicable Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Rate Loans, or materially restricts the authority of such Lender to (a) purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, the applicable
currency or (b) determine or charge interest rates based upon any RFR, any Daily Simple RFR, the Eurocurrency Rate or the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Initial Primary Borrower through the
Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of any determination described in Section 3.02(a) , any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Rate Loans in such currency shall be suspended
until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Initial Primary Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon becoming aware thereof) and, until such time,
the Loans or Obligations of such Lender in such currency shall, at the option of the applicable Borrower, be converted to, and shall continue, as Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in an amount equal to the aggregate Dollar Equivalent of such
Loans immediately prior to such suspension, which conversion shall be on the last day of the Interest Period therefor (if applicable), if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such Loans and Obligations to such day, or immediately,
if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans or Obligations to such day, and (ii) in the case of any determination described in Section 3.02(b) , any obligation of such Lender to maintain Loans
accruing interest at such RFR, such Daily Simple RFR, such Eurocurrency Rate or such Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, as applicable, or to convert Loans accruing interest calculated by reference to the Base Rate (unless the Base Rate is also calculated
off Daily Simple RFR in accordance with the definition of Base Rate to be Loans accruing interest calculated by reference to such RFR, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Initial Primary
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon becoming aware thereof) and, until such time, any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Rate Loans of such Lender outstanding at
the time of such suspension (to the extent of the affected Loans or the affected Interest Periods) shall, at the option of the applicable Borrower, be continued as Base Rate Loans in an amount equal to the aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount of such
Loans and Obligations immediately prior to such suspension, which conversion shall be on the last day of the Interest Period therefor (if applicable), if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such Loans and Obligations to such day,
or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans or Obligations to such day. Upon the prepayment of any such Loans, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued and unpaid interest on the amount so prepaid. Each
Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender or result in increased
taxes to any Borrower. 
 97 

3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. 
 (a) Subject to Section 3.04 , in connection with any request for a Committed Borrowing of, conversion to, or
continuation of, any RFR Rate Loan or otherwise, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that (A) if Daily Simple RFR is utilized in any
calculations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining Daily Simple RFR pursuant to the
definition thereof, or (B) if Term SOFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for
ascertaining Term SOFR for the applicable Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan on or prior to the first day of such Interest Period, (ii) the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Initial Primary Borrower, determines
(which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that a material fundamental change has occurred in the foreign exchange markets with respect to an applicable Alternative Currency (including a material fundamental change
in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls) or (iii) the Required Lenders reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest
error) that (A) if Daily Simple RFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, Daily Simple RFR does not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans or (B) if Term SOFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts,
Term SOFR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during the applicable Interest Period and, in the case of either of the foregoing Section 3.03(a)(iii)(A) or
 Section 3.03(a)(iii)(B) , the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then, in each case the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Initial Primary
Borrower. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Initial Primary Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make RFR Rate Loans in each such affected currency, and any right of the Borrowers to convert any Loan in each such currency
(if applicable) to, or continue any Loan as, an RFR Rate Loan in each such affected currency, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected RFR Rate Loans or, in the case of Term SOFR Loans, the affected Interest Periods) until the
Administrative Agent (with respect to Section 3.03(a)(iii) , at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice, which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to do promptly upon becoming aware of such
circumstances ceasing to exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Committed Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of, RFR Rate Loans in each such affected currency (to the extent of the
affected RFR Rate Loans or, in the case of Term SOFR Loans, the affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, (I) in the case of any request for a Committed Borrowing of any affected Daily Simple RFR Loans in Dollars or any affected Term SOFR
Loans, the Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of, or conversion to, Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein, and (II) in the case of any request for a Committed Borrowing
of any affected Daily Simple RFR Loans in an Alternative Currency, then such request shall be ineffective, and (B)(I) any outstanding affected Daily Simple RFR Loans in Dollars will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans immediately,
(II) any outstanding affected Term SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period, and (III) any outstanding affected Daily Simple
 
 98 

RFR Loans in an Alternative Currency, at the applicable Borrower s election, shall either (1) be converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar
Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) immediately or (2) be prepaid in full, together with accrued interest thereon (subject to the last sentence of Section 2.08(a) immediately; provided that if no election
is made by the Borrowers by the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by the Borrowers of such notice, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected clause (1) above. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the
Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.06 . 
 (b) Subject to Section 3.04 , in connection with any request for a Committed Borrowing of, or continuation of, any
Eurocurrency Rate Loan or otherwise, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable interbank
market for the applicable currency, amount and Interest Period of such Loan, (ii) the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Initial Primary Borrower, determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest
error) that a material fundamental change has occurred in the foreign exchange or interbank markets with respect to the applicable Alternative Currency (including a material fundamental change in national or international financial, political or
economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls), (iii) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the
ascertaining the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such Alternative Currency and Interest Period, including because the Eurocurrency Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency is not available or published on a current basis, or (iv) the
Required Lenders reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans
during such Interest Period and have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then, in each case, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Initial Primary Borrower. Upon receipt of such notice,
until the Administrative Agent (with respect to Section 3.03(b)(iv) , at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice, which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to do promptly upon becoming aware
of such circumstances ceasing to exist, (x) any pending request for a Committed Borrowing of, or continuation of, Eurocurrency Rate Loans in each such affected Alternative Currency (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or the
affected Interest Periods) shall be ineffective and (y) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at the applicable Borrower s election, shall either (A) be converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount
equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) at the end of the applicable Interest Period or (B) be prepaid in full, together with accrued interest thereon (subject to Section 2.08(a) ), at the end of
the applicable Interest Period; provided that if no election is made by the Borrowers by the date that is the earlier of (I) the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by the Borrowers of such notice and (II) the

3.04 Effect of Benchmark Transition Event. 
 (a) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a
Benchmark Transition Event with respect to any Benchmark, the Administrative Agent and the Initial Primary Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace such Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark
Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5 th Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and the Initial
Primary Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to
this Section 3.04(a) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date. (b) Conforming
Changes . In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement (other than any consent of the Initial Primary Borrower

pursuant to this Section 3.04 , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any
decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.04 . (d) Unavailability of
Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if any then-current Benchmark is a term rate
(including the Term SOFR Reference Rate, EURIBOR or BBSY) and either (x) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent
in its reasonable discretion or (y) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be
representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any affected Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant 
 100 

to Section 3.04(d)(i) either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is
not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all affected Benchmark
settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (e) Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon the Initial
Primary Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a given Benchmark, (i) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Committed Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation
of, any RFR Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as applicable, in each case to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period denominated in the applicable currency and, failing that, (x) in the case of any
request for a Committed Borrowing of any affected Daily Simple RFR Loans in Dollars or any affected Term SOFR Loans, if applicable, the Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of or
conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (y) in the case of any request for a Committed Borrowing of any affected Daily Simple RFR Loans in an Alternative Currency or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, if applicable, then such
request shall be ineffective, and (ii)(x) any outstanding affected Daily Simple RFR Loans in Dollars, if applicable, will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans immediately, (y) any outstanding affected Term SOFR Loans, if
applicable, will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period, and (z) any outstanding affected Daily Simple RFR Loans in an Alternative Currency or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at the
applicable Borrower s election, shall either (A) be converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the applicable Alternative Currency) immediately in the case of Daily Simple RFR
Loans in an Alternative Currency, or at the end of the applicable Interest Period in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or (B) be prepaid in full immediately in the case of Daily Simple RFR Loans in an Alternative Currency, or at the end of
the applicable Interest Period in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans; provided that, with respect to any Daily Simple RFR Loan in an Alternative Currency, if no election is made by the Borrowers by the date that is three (3) Business
Days after receipt by the Borrowers of such notice, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected clause (A) above; provided further that, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, if no election is made by the Borrowers by the
earlier of (I) the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by the Borrowers of such notice and (II) the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Borrowers shall be deemed to
have elected clause (A) above. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
 Section 3.06 . During a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to any Benchmark or at any time that a tenor for any then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the
then-current Benchmark that is the subject of such Benchmark Unavailability Period or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Base Rate. 
 101 

3.05 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. 
 (a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall: 
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.05(e) or the L/C Issuer; 
 (ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of
Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, RFR Rate Loan or Base Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for (x) Excluded
Taxes, (y) Non-Excluded Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment under any Loan Document, and (z) Other Taxes); or 
 (iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting
this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loan, RFR Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the
result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, RFR Rate Loan or Base Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to
such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), in each case by an amount deemed to be material by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, each
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered with respect to
such Borrower s Loans or Letters of Credit; provided that such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall have applied generally consistent return metrics to other similarly situated borrowers with respect to such increased cost or reduced return
(it being understood that the amount of such increased cost or reduced return between similarly situated borrowers may be different after consideration of facility pricing, structure, usage patterns, capital treatment and banking relationship). 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or
any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s
capital or on the capital of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender,
or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration
such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), by an amount deemed by such Lender or the L/C Issuer
 
 102 

to be material, then from time to time each Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C
Issuer or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered with respect to such Borrower s Loans or Letters of Credit; provided that such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall have applied generally
consistent return metrics to other similarly situated borrowers with respect to such increased cost or reduced return (it being understood that the amount of such increased cost or reduced return between similarly situated borrowers may be different
after consideration of facility pricing, structure, usage patterns, capital treatment and banking relationship); provided , further , that amounts paid under this Section 3.05(b) shall not be duplicative of any
amounts paid by the Borrowers in Section 3.05(a) . (c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a
Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts (including reasonable detail regarding the calculation of such amounts) necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
 Section 3.05(a) or (b) and delivered to the Borrowers shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the
part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s right to demand such
compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered
more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Initial Primary Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the
L/C Issuer s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the
period of retroactive effect thereof). (e) Additional Reserve Requirements . The applicable Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as
long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans made to such Borrower or the funding of RFR Rate Loans made to such Borrower in an Alternative Currency, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five
(5) decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which
interest is payable on such Loan, provided such Borrower shall have received at least ten (10) days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice
ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional costs shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice. 
 103 

3.06 Compensation for Losses. 
 Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, each Borrower shall promptly pay the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a)
any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan made to it, other than a Base Rate Loan or a Daily Simple RFR Loan, on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by such Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a
Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or a Daily Simple RFR Loan on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower; 
 (c) any failure by such Borrower to make payment of any Loan made to it or drawing under any Letter of Credit issued for its account (or
interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than a Daily Simple RFR Loan) on its scheduled due date or, except as permitted hereby, any payment thereof in a different currency; or 
 (d) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a Term SOFR Loan made to it on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor
as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 10.13 ; excluding any loss of margin or spread and net of the
income that such Lender has reasonably estimated it would receive from investing the proceeds of the applicable Loans in investments selected by it in its reasonable discretion through the end of the applicable Interest Period, but including any
foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of
any foreign exchange contract. The applicable Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Borrower shall be liable to pay any loss, cost or
expense to the extent that such loss, cost or expense is due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a Lender. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 3.06 shall not apply with respect to any Base Rate Loan or any
Daily Simple RFR Loan. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by any Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.06 , each
Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan, and each Term SOFR Loan made by it at the applicable SOFR Rate for such Loan, as applicable, by a matching deposit or other
borrowing in the applicable interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or such Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, was in fact so funded. 
 104 

3.07 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
 (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.05 , or any
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01 , or if any Lender gives a notice
pursuant to Section 3.02 , then such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts (subject to any internal policies or procedures generally applicable to such Lender) to designate a different Lending
Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.05 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , as
applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. Each
Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment with respect to such Borrower s Loans or Letters of Credit. 
 (b) Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.05 , or if any Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 , the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance with

which do not materially increase the authority of a General Partner or adversely affect the rights of the Lenders or to fix any other obvious error or any other error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature. The Initial Primary Borrower
shall, promptly following execution or completion thereof, provide to the Administrative Agent (x) a copy of any alteration, amendment, modification, termination or change to any Organization Document of a Primary Borrower, the Parent Fund or
the Pledged Entity and (y) with respect to any Material Amendment of a Valuation Policy, a summary of the provisions of such Valuation Policy as so amended.

rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become

Primary Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.06(b) 
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.06(d) .

entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
 (d) Participations . Any Lender may at any time, with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and, unless
an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a) , (f) or (g) has occurred and is continuing, or any other Event of Default has continued for a period of thirty (30) days, the Initial Primary Borrower, sell
participations to any Person (other than a natural person, any Borrower or any Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender s participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided further , that prior to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default under
 Section 8.01(a) that has continued for a period of at least sixty (60) days, no Participant may be a Competitor. 
 Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to Section 10.06(e) , each Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 , 3.05 and 3.06 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(e) (it being understood that the
documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
 Section 10.06(b) ; provided that such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 with respect to any participation than its participating Lender would
have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. 
 153 

In the event that any Lender sells a participation pursuant to this
 Section 10.06(d) , such Lender shall maintain with respect to such participation, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, a register comparable to the
Register (the Participant Register ). Interests in the rights and/or obligations of a Lender under this Agreement may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on such Participant Register. No
Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its
other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that the relevant Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant

have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights . A Participant shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Initial Primary Borrower. In addition, a Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation
sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender. 
 (f) Certain Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this

Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to Section 10.06(b) , such L/C Issuer may, upon sixty (60) days notice to the Initial Primary Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the event of any
such resignation as L/C Issuer, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided , however , that no failure by the Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the
resignation of such L/C Issuer as L/C Issuer. If an L/C Issuer resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective
date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to

Beneficiary of or Participant in (and to the extent that such actual or proposed Beneficiary is a funding vehicle of a Lender, the administrative agents, trustees and advisors appointed in connection with the funding arrangement to which such
Beneficiary is a party), any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender pursuant to Sections 2.15(d) or 2.16 , or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors)
to any swap or derivative transaction or any actual or prospective credit insurer or reinsurer relating to a Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Initial Primary Borrower, (h) to the extent such Information

nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers, or (i) with the prior written consent of the Initial Primary Borrower, on a confidential basis to any rating agency. 
 For purposes of this Section 10.07 , Information means all information received from any Borrower
or any Subsidiary relating to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by such Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 10.07 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to

 If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby

obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer which are then due and payable, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
although such obligations of such Borrower may be owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and
their respective Affiliates under this Section 10.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and
the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Initial Primary Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and
application. 10.09 Interest Rate Limitation.

exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by
the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01 , this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the
Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other
electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 10.11 Survival of

delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each

unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 10.13 Replacement of Lenders.

to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 , if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives any Borrower the right to
replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to
the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06 ), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations

Limited Partnership Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands and not for the purpose of recovering any amount from the personal assets or property of such General Partner (or the general partner of such General Partner). 
 161 

10.22 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of
Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement,
arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to Write-Down and

Swap Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, QFC Credit Support , and each such QFC, a Supported QFC ), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the
resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the
 U.S. Special Resolution Regimes in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by
the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): 
 162 

In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a Covered
Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC
Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered
Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are
permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United
States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC
Credit Support. [NO FURTHER TEXT ON THIS PAGE]
