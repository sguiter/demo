 Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants as of the end of each fiscal quarter and on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to any borrowings.

 million. On October 1, 2023, the self-insurance retention was increased to million for the auto policy. Insurance is purchased over our retention to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. Estimates are recorded for potential and incurred outstanding liabilities for workers compensation, auto and general liability claims and claims that are incurred but not reported. Estimates are based on adjusters estimates, historical experience and statistical methods commonly used within the insurance industry that we believe are reliable. We have also engaged a third-party actuary to perform a review of our accrued liability for these claims as well as potential funded losses in our captive insurance company. Insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices and the selection of estimated loss among estimates derived using different methods. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs. 
 
 Since October 2020, we have elected to utilize a wholly owned insurance captive to insure the self-insured retention for our workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability insurance programs. All accrued liabilities associated with periods from October 2017 through current were transferred to the captive. 
 
 We maintain excess property and casualty programs with third-party insurers in an effort to limit the financial impact of significant events covered under these programs. Our operating subsidiaries pay premiums to both the excess and reinsurance carriers and our captive for the estimated losses based on an external actuarial analysis. These premiums held by our wholly owned captive are currently held in a restricted account, resulting in a transfer of risk from our operating subsidiaries to the captive. 
 
 We also maintain a self-insurance program for managing employee medical claims in excess of employee deductibles. As claims are paid, the liability is relieved. We also maintain third party insurance stop-loss coverage for individual medical claims exceeding a certain minimum threshold . In addition, we maintain million of umbrella insurance coverage for annual aggregate medical claims exceeding approximately million.

 _______________ 
 (1) Reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the field level of operations. 
 (2) In October 2023, our five year purchase contract in North Texas and South Central Oklahoma (the Red River area expired and was not renewed, which resulted in a decrease in field level purchase volumes. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 . Crude oil marketing revenues decreased by 59.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of lower overall crude oil volumes, which decreased revenues by approximately 51.6 million, and a decrease in the market price of crude oil, which decreased revenues by approximately 7.5 million. The average crude oil price received was 79.26 per barrel during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which decreased to 73.99 per barrel during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues from our volumes are mostly based upon the market price in our market areas, primarily in the Gulf Coast. The fluctuations in the market price of crude oil during the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period was primarily due to OPEC oil production cuts and U.S. inventory draws from the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast as well as the events in Ukraine and Israel, which have resulted in the volatility in crude oil prices. 
 
 Crude oil field level volumes decreased due to the expiration on October 31, 2023 and non-renewal of our five year purchase contract in the Red River area. In October 2018, we acquired a trucking company operating in the Red River area, and subsequently entered into a new revenue agreement at that time. During the five year period, volumes handled in the Red River area ranged from an average of 25,000 to 28,000 barrels per day. The purchase price for Red River area volumes was based on a contractual price for volumes in North Texas and Oklahoma, which had been slightly lower than the purchase price for legacy volumes. The expiration of this contract has resulted in a decrease in the average crude oil volumes for the crude oil marketing segment beginning in November 2023, which has also resulted in lower revenues. 
 
 Driver compensation decreased by 1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower volumes transported in the 2024 period and a decrease in the overall driver count, both of which were due to the expiration of the Red River area contract. 
 
 Insurance costs decreased by 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower insurance claims and a decrease in the overall driver count in the 2024 period. Fuel costs also decreased by 0.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a lower overall driver count and lower crude oil volumes in the 2024 period. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased by 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the timing of purchases and retirements of tractors and other field equipment during 2023 and 2024. In connection with the expiration of the Red River area contract, we sold 36 tractors and 65 trailers during the fourth quarter of 2023, and also transferred tractors and trailers to other areas of our business.

Table of Contents 

 Our crude oil marketing operating earnings decreased by 5.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of inventory valuation changes (as shown in the table below) and lower driver compensation, insurance costs and fuel costs resulting from the expiration of the Red River area contract, partially offset by lower crude oil volumes and a decrease in the average market price of crude oil in the 2024 period. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 . Crude oil marketing revenues increased by 53.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in the market price of crude oil, which increased revenues by approximately 764.8 million, partially offset by lower overall crude oil volumes, which decreased revenues by approximately 711.0 million. The average crude oil price received was 74.29 per barrel during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which increased to 76.24 per barrel during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and the decrease in crude oil volumes during the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period are discussed further above. 
 
 Driver compensation decreased by 4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower volumes transported in the 2024 period and a decrease in the overall driver count, both of which were due to the expiration of the Red River area contract. 
 
 Insurance costs decreased by 1.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower insurance claims and a decrease in the overall driver count in the 2024 period. Fuel costs decreased by 2.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a lower overall driver count and lower crude oil volumes in the 2024 period. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the timing of purchases and retirements of tractors and other field equipment during 2023 and 2024, and the sale or transfer of tractors and trailers as a result of the expiration of the Red River area contract in 2023. 
 
 Our crude oil marketing operating earnings increased by 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of inventory valuation changes (as shown in the table below), an increase in the average market price of crude oil in the 2024 period and lower driver compensation, insurance costs and fuel costs resulting from the expiration of the Red River area contract, partially offset by lower crude oil volumes in the 2024 period. 
 
 Field Level Operating Earnings (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) . Inventory valuations and forward month derivative instrument valuations (mark-to-market) are two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil marketing segment operating earnings or losses. As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, we hold inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines. Generally, during periods of increasing crude oil prices, we recognize inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, we recognize inventory liquidation and valuation losses. 
 
 Crude oil marketing operating earnings can be affected by the valuations of our forward month derivative instruments. These non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date. We generally enter into these derivative contracts as part of a strategy to protect the crude oil inventory value from market price fluctuations. The valuation of derivative instruments at period end requires the recognition of non-cash mark-to-market gains and losses. We had no forward month derivative instruments outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 (1) The use of field level operating earnings is unique to us, not a substitute for a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants. We utilize this data to evaluate the profitability of our operations. 
 
 Field level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes depict our day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the product and delivering the product to market sales point. Field level operating earnings increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower operating costs related to the expiration of the Red River area contract and lower other operating costs in the 2024 period, partially offset by lower revenues resulting from lower crude oil volumes and prices in the 2024 period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, field level operating earnings increased as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher revenues resulting from higher crude oil prices in the 2024 period and lower operating costs related to the expiration of the Red River area contract in the 2023 period, partially offset by lower crude oil volumes in the 2024 period. 
 
 We held crude oil inventory at a weighted average composite price as follows at the dates indicated (in barrels): 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Average Average Barrels Price Barrels Price Crude oil inventory 411,426 71.35 267,731 72.35 
 
 Prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 (1) Revenues, net of fuel costs, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is utilized for internal analysis of the results of our transportation segment. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 . Transportation revenues decreased by 2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Transportation revenues, net of fuel costs, decreased by 2.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. These decreases in transportation revenues were primarily due to a decrease in volumes and transportation rates during the 2024 period as a result of a softening in the transportation market due to changes in demand, supply chain issues and inflation. Softening of customer demand led us to close two terminals in late 2023, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in Atlanta, Georgia, and a third terminal in St. Rose, Louisiana, during the first quarter of 2024, with drivers being reassigned to nearby terminals, bringing our total to sixteen terminals in ten states at the end of September 2024. Revenues also decreased due to the impacts of hurricanes, including Beryl, Debby, Francine and Helene, which affected our operations and those of certain of our customers in the southern states during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Driver commissions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were relatively consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023, with a slight decrease in the overall driver count and lower mileage during the current period.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 . Our logistics and repurposing segment consists of Firebird Bulk Carriers, Inc. Firebird ), which transports crude oil, condensate, fuels, oils and other petroleum products, largely in the Eagle Ford basin, and Phoenix Oil, Inc. Phoenix ), which repurposes and finds beneficial uses for off-specification fuels, lubricants, crude oil and other chemicals from producers in the U.S. Revenues earned from Firebird operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 1.9 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in transportation volumes in the current period. Revenues earned from Phoenix operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 2.0 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower volumes and activity.

 Income Taxes 
 
 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes is based upon federal and state tax rates, and variations in amounts are consistent with taxable income (loss) in the respective accounting periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are (i) our cash balance, (ii) cash flow from operating activities, (iii) borrowings under our Credit Agreement and (iv) funds received from the sale of equity securities. Our primary cash requirements include, but are not limited to, (a) ordinary course of business uses, such as the payment of amounts related to the purchase of crude oil, and other expenses, (b) discretionary capital spending for investments in our business and (c) dividends to our shareholders. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity through our current cash balances, availability under our Credit Agreement, expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing tractor and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. Our cash balance and cash flow from operating activities is dependent on the success of future operations. If our cash inflow subsides or turns negative, we will evaluate our investment plan accordingly and remain flexible. 
 
 We maintain cash balances in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs. Cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): 
 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 25,089 33,256 Working capital 7,676 21,684 
 
 Our cash balance at September 30, 2024 decreased by 25 percent from December 31, 2023, as discussed further below.

 We have in place a Credit Agreement with Cadence Bank. The Credit Agreement provides for (a) a revolving credit facility that allows for borrowings up to 60.0 million in aggregate principal amount from time to time, and (b) a term loan in the initial aggregate principal amount of 25.0 million (the Term Loan ). We may also obtain letters of credit under the revolving credit facility up to a maximum amount of 30.0 million, which reduces availability under the revolving credit facility by a like amount. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be, at our option, base rate loans (defined by reference to the higher of the prime rate, the federal funds rate or an adjusted term secured overnight financing rate SOFR for a one month tenor plus one percent) or SOFR loans, in each case plus an applicable margin, the amount of which is determined by reference to our consolidated total leverage ratio, and is between 1 percent and 2 percent for base rate loans and between 2 percent and 3 percent for SOFR loans. 
 
 The Term Loan amortizes on a 10-year schedule with quarterly payments beginning December 31, 2022, and matures October 27, 2027. Proceeds of the Term Loan were used, together with additional cash on hand, to fund the repurchase of shares from KSA Industries, Inc. KSA and certain of its affiliates on October 31, 2022. The Term Loan bears interest at the SOFR loan rate plus the applicable margin for SOFR loans. 
 
 We are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, including a consolidated leverage ratio, an asset coverage ratio and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. On August 2, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment (i) clarifies our ability to exclude crude oil inventory valuation losses (and, to the extent included in our consolidated net income, inventory liquidation gains) from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the related financial covenants, (ii) provides for the exclusion of unusual and non-recurring losses and expenses from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA, not to exceed 10.0 percent of Consolidated EBITDA for the period, and (iii) amends the definition of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to include letters of credit and banker s acceptances only to the extent such letters of credit or banker s acceptances have been drawn, for purposes of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio calculation in the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment applies to our fiscal period ending June 30, 2023 and thereafter. 
 
 On July 16, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment amended and restated the definitions of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Fixed Charges in order (i) to remove the inclusion of Operating Lease Expenses paid in cash from both the numerator and denominator in the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, and (ii) to clarify that only Consolidated Interest Expense paid in cash is included in the denominator of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. These amendments applied to the financial covenant calculations for the period ending June 30, 2024 and thereafter. 
 
 On November 8, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment amends and restates the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement in order to (i) lower the maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to 2.00 to 1.00 (from 2.50 to 1.00), commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024 and for each fiscal quarter thereafter; (ii) increase the minimum Asset Coverage Ratio to 2.50 to 1.00 (from 2.00 to 1.00), commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024 and for each fiscal quarter thereafter; and (iii) decrease the minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to 1.05 to 1.00 (from 1.25 to 1.00) for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, and to 1.10 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2024, returning to 1.25 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025 and each fiscal quarter thereafter. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 15.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, representing the remaining principal balance of the Term Loan, at a weighted average interest rate of 7.60 percent. We also had 11.5 million of letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement at a fee of 2.25 percent per annum. No amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. See Note 10 in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our Credit Agreement.

 We have in place an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement ATM Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as agent (the Agent ), under which we may offer to sell shares of our common stock through or to the Agent for cash from time to time. We filed a registration statement initially registering an aggregate of 20.0 million of shares of common stock for sale under the ATM Agreement which was declared effective in January 2021. In December 2023, we filed a new registration statement which replaced our prior shelf registration statement and restored the aggregate of 20.0 million of shares of common stock for sale under the ATM Agreement. The registration statement was declared effective on January 5, 2024. The total number of shares of common stock to be sold, if any, and the price at which the shares will be sold will be determined by us periodically in connection with any such sales, though the total amount sold may not exceed the limitations stated in the registration statement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were sold under the ATM Agreement, and the full capacity of the ATM Agreement remains unsold. 
 
 We utilize cash from operations to make discretionary investments in our four business segments. With the exception of operating and finance lease commitments primarily associated with storage tank terminal arrangements, leased office space, tractors, trailers and other equipment, and borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility, our future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows decrease. See below for information regarding our operating and finance lease obligations. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 The most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations, and these earnings are dependent on the success of future operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities 
 
 Our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 14,703 7,838 Investing activities (10,810) (5,839) Financing activities (13,602) (8,178) 
 
 Operating activities . Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 6.9 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in our working capital accounts, including a decrease in receivables from customers and an increase in payables to vendors. These items, which resulted in increases in cash provided by operating activities, were partially offset by a decrease of approximately 1.2 million in early payments received from customers in the 2024 period and an increase of approximately 0.8 million in early payments made to suppliers in the 2024 period. Crude oil inventory increased by 10.2 million at September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase of 53.7 percent in the number of barrels held in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in the price of our crude oil inventory, which decreased from 72.35 per barrel at December 31, 2023 to 71.35 per barrel at September 30, 2024. 
 
 At various times each month, we may make cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within our crude oil marketing operations. Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to us. In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, we may also early pay our suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date

 of the twentieth of the month following the month of production. These early payments reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date. 
 
 We also require certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with us in order to support their purchases from us. Early payments and cash collateral received from customers increase cash and reduce accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. 
 
 Early payments received from customers and early payments to suppliers were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Early payments received 31,683 32,850 Early payments to suppliers 5,361 4,546 
 
 We rely heavily on our ability to obtain open-line trade credit from our suppliers especially with respect to our crude oil marketing operations. The timing of payments and receipts of these early pays received and paid can have a significant impact on our cash balance. 
 
 Investing activities . Net cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 5.0 million as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was due to an increase of 4.4 million in capital spending for property and equipment (see following table) and a decrease of 0.6 million in cash proceeds from the sales of assets in the current period. 
 
 Capital spending by reporting segment was as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):

The change in net cash flows from financing activities of 5.4 million was primarily due to the following cash outflows and inflows: 
 
 an increase in the 2024 period in net repayments under our Credit Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made principal payments of 6.9 million on the Term Loan, while during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made principal payments of 1.9 million on the Term Loan.

We had no borrowings or repayments under the revolving credit facility in 2024; 
 a decrease of 0.1 million in principal repayments for finance lease obligations (see Material Cash Requirements below for information regarding our finance lease obligations); 
 a decrease of 0.5 million in the 2024 period in net proceeds from the sale of common shares under the ATM Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were sold under the ATM Agreement, while during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received net proceeds of approximately 0.5 million from the sale of 14,680 of our common shares; and 
 consistent payments in the 2024 and 2023 periods for cash dividends paid on our common shares. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid cash dividends of 0.72 per common share, or totals of 1.9 million in each period.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time as incidental to our operations, we may become involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes. As an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, we are a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims and other items of general liability as would be typical for the industry. We are presently unaware of any claims against us that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K and the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our other SEC filings. Any of these risks could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our Risk Factors from those disclosed in Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K or our other SEC filings. 
 
 Risks Related to the Proposed Merger 
 
 The announcement and pendency of the proposed acquisition of the Company could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 On November 11, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Tres Energy LLC, a Texas limited liability company Parent ), and ARE Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger ). If the Merger is consummated, our securities will be delisted from the NYSE American and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as promptly as practicable after the effective time of the Merger. Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees, customers, and other parties may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These risks to our business include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger: 
 
 the impairment of our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, including key personnel; 
 the diversion of significant management time and resources toward completion of the Merger; 
 difficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners; 
 delays or deferments of certain business decisions by our customers, suppliers and other business partners; 
 the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business because the Merger Agreement requires us to use reasonable best efforts to conduct our business in the ordinary course and to preserve our business organization intact and maintain existing relations with key business partners and governmental entities, and refrain from taking certain actions without Parent s consent prior to the completion of the Merger; 
 litigation related to the Merger and the costs related thereto; and 
 the incurrence of significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger.

Table of Contents 

 Litigation relating to the Merger may be filed against us and our Board of Directors, which could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger or result in the payment of damages. 
 
 Litigation relating to the Merger may be filed against us and our Board of Directors. Among other remedies, these claimants could seek damages and/or seek to enjoin the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such lawsuits could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger and result in significant costs. Any such actions may create uncertainty relating to the Merger and may be costly and distracting to management. 
 
 Failure to consummate the Merger within the expected timeframe or at all could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary mutual closing conditions, including (a) the approval of our stockholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (b) the absence of any order, injunction, decree or law issued or enforced by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that prohibits, renders illegal or enjoins the consummation of the Merger. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon certain unilateral closing conditions, including the other party s representations and warranties being accurate (subject to certain customary materiality exceptions), the other party having in all material respects performed and complied with its covenants in the Merger Agreement and, in Parent s case, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to us. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all or that the Merger will be completed. 
 
 If the Merger is not completed, including as a result of our stockholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company, and our shares will continue to be traded on the NYSE American stock exchange. Our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 
 we may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting customers, suppliers, and other business partners; 
 we would incur significant costs in future periods relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger; 
 we may be required to pay a cash termination fee as required under the Merger Agreement, which may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes or other uses and could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us or deter such third party from making a competing acquisition proposal; and 
 the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may have delayed or prevented us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, we may have pursued. 
 
 If the Merger is not consummated, the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price, especially to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed.
