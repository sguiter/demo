The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.

 per Public Share initially, per Public Share as of September 30, 2024).

If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined below) agree to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the initial shareholders will not be entitled to redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem the Public Shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.

In addition, the initial shareholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. The Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, as amended, provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.

 from the closing of the initial public offering or until January 17, 2024, to consummate an initial Business Combination. However, on January 11, 2024, the Company filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to: (i) to change the date by which the Company must consummate a Business Combination to October 17, 2025 or such earlier date as is determined by the Company s board of directors (the Board ), in its sole discretion, to be in the best interests of the Company (the Extension Amendment (ii) to remove the limitation that the company shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in its Initial Public Offering prior to the consummation of a Business Combination that would cause the Company s net tangible assets to be less than following such repurchases, (the Redemption Limitation Amendment and (iii) to provide for the right of a holder of Class B ordinary shares, par value per share, to convert such shares into shares of the Company s Class A ordinary shares on a -for-one basis prior to initial Business Combination (the Conversion Amendment and, together with the Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation, the Charter Amendments ). On January 10, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in lieu of an annual general meeting (the Shareholder Meeting at which their shareholders approved: (a) an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association: (i) to change the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination to October 17, 2025 or such earlier date as is determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, to be in the best interests of the Company (the Extension Amendment (ii) to remove the limitation that the company shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in its initial public offering prior to the consummation of a business combination that would cause the Company s net tangible assets to be less than following such repurchases, (the Redemption Limitation Amendment and (iii) to provide for the right of a holder of Class B ordinary shares, par value per share, to convert such shares into shares of the Company s Class A ordinary shares on a -for-one basis prior to initial business combination (the Conversion Amendment ), and (b) the appointment of Richard Thompson and Sharon Youngblood as Class I directors to each serve on the Board for a three -year term expiring at the third succeeding annual general meeting after their appointment, or until their successors have been qualified and appointed. Additionally, shareholders holding Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of . In connection with the approval of the Conversion Amendment, on January 25, 2024, the Sponsor voluntarily elected to convert of its Class B ordinary shares to Class A ordinary shares, and the independent directors of the Company voluntarily elected to convert an aggregate of Class B ordinary shares to Class A ordinary shares, in each case, on a -for-one basis in accordance with the articles (such conversions collectively, the Founder Share Conversion, and the Class A ordinary shares issued upon such conversion, the Converted Class A Shares ). After giving effect to the Founder Share Conversion, Sponsor-held Class B ordinary share remains issued and outstanding. Following such redemptions and the conversion of Class B ordinary shares, Class A ordinary shares remain outstanding, including publicly held Class A ordinary shares. The Sponsor and the independent directors waived any right to receive funds from the Trust Account established by the Company in connection with its Initial Public Offering that was consummated on October 17, 2022, with respect to any Converted Class A Shares, and additional funds were deposited into the Trust Account in respect of any such shares. The Converted Class A Shares will remain subject to the existing transfer restrictions on the Class B ordinary shares following such conversions. In connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to make monthly deposits directly to the Company s Trust Account of per month (each deposit is a Contribution ). The maximum aggregate amount of all Contributions under the promissory note will not exceed . The Contributions are paid monthly (or a pro-rata portion thereof if less than a full month), beginning on January 11, 2024, and thereafter on the fifteenth day of each subsequent month (or if such fifteenth day is not a business day, on the business day immediately preceding such fifteenth day) until the earlier of (i) the consummation of a Business Combination, and (ii) the end of the Combination Period. The promissory note is non-interest bearing and is payable upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination and if the Business Combination is not consummated, the date of the termination, dissolution, or winding up of the Company as determined in the sole discretion of the Board. On October 2, 2024, the Board determined that in order to make the Company a more attractive partner to sponsors of special purpose acquisition companies seeking to take over the management and affairs of special purpose acquisition companies, following the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on November 13, 2024, the Sponsor and any successor to the obligations of the Sponsor are no longer be required to make monthly deposits to the Trust Account of for each outstanding Class A ordinary share, up to a maximum of per month. The Company received an aggregate amount of

Table of Contents SPRING VALLEY ACQUISITION CORP. II NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 for the period from January 11, 2024, through September 30, 2024, under the promissory note. In connection with the vote to approve the Amendment (as defined below) at the extraordinary general meeting held on November 13, 2024, holders of Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately . As a result, approximately remains in the Trust Account and Class A ordinary shares remain outstanding. The underwriters agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement (a Target ), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) per Public Share or (ii) the lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or Target that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Going Concern Consideration As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in cash held outside of the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of approximately million after considering the extension promissory note of 1.3 million. The Company s liquidity needs to date were satisfied through the payment of from the Sponsor to cover certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for issuance of the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4), and loan from the Sponsor of approximately under the Note (as defined in Note 4) and the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. The Company repaid the Note in full on October 18, 2022, and the facility is no longer available. In addition, in order to finance the transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Company s founding team, or any of their affiliates may provide the Company with Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 4) as may be required (of which up to million may be converted at the lender s option into warrants). As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there was Working Capital Loan outstanding. Based on the current operating plan, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital to meet its working capital needs through the earlier of consummation of an initial Business Combination or mandatory liquidation date. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. Management plans to complete the initial Business Combination prior to the mandatory liquidation date and expects to receive financing from the Sponsor or the affiliates of the Sponsor to meet its obligations through the time of liquidation or the completion of the initial Business Combination. There is no financing that is currently committed and no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate the initial Business Combination will

In accordance with the ASC 480-10-S99-3A, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities , redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require the security to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. The Company classified all of the Class A ordinary shares as redeemable. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized a charge against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit for the difference between the initial carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares and the redemption value.

The Sponsor agreed, subject to exceptions, not to transfer any unvested Founder Shares prior to the date such securities become vested. Founder Shares, if any, that remain unvested at the fifth anniversary of the closing of the initial Business Combination will be forfeited, subject to certain exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the satisfaction of the other transfer restrictions on the Founder Shares described herein, the Sponsor may be able to transfer up to of its Founder Shares even if it is required to forfeit all of its unvested Founder Shares and even if the trading price of Class A ordinary shares declines materially.

 Class B ordinary shares to each of the Company s directors. The sale of the Founder Shares is in the scope of ASC 718.

II, except where the context requires otherwise. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events.

Such statements include, but are not limited to, possible business combinations and the financing thereof, and related matters, as well as all other statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on January 19, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (an initial business combination or the business combination ). We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete an initial business combination will be successful. As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from January 19, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to our formation and the initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering described below and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for and efforts toward completing an initial business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. Our Sponsor is Spring Valley Acquisition Sponsor II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ). The registration statement for our Initial Public Offering was declared effective on October 12, 2022. On October 17, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), including the issuance of 3,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriter s full exercise of their over-allotment option, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of approximately 230.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately 13.4 million, of which approximately 8.1 million was for deferred underwriting commissions. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Class A ordinary share (the Right ), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (each, a Public Warrant ). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A ordinary shares at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement Private Placement of 13,350,000 warrants (each, a Private Placement Warrant and collectively, the Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of approximately 13.4 million. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A ordinary shares at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.

 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, approximately 235.8 million 10.25 per Unit) of net proceeds, including the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement, was placed in a trust account Trust Account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by us, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a business combination successfully. We must complete one or more initial business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in the Trust Account and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. However, we only intend to complete a business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of Target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in Target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will provide the holders of our issued and outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely at our discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro-rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account (initially at 10.25 per Public Share). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters. Initially, the Company had 15 months from the closing of the initial public offering or until January 17, 2024, to consummate an initial Business Combination. However, on January 11, 2024, the Company filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association which change the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination to October 17, 2025 or such earlier date as is determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, to be in the best interests of the Company. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay for our taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. On January 10, 2024, we held the Extraordinary General Meeting at which our shareholders approved: (a) an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association: (i) to change the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination to October 17, 2025 or such earlier date as is determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, to be in the best interests of the Company (the Extension Amendment (ii) to remove the limitation that the company shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in its initial public offering prior to the consummation of a business combination that would cause the Company s net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 following such repurchases, (the Redemption Limitation Amendment and (iii) to provide for the right of a holder of Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, to convert such shares into shares of the Company s Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis prior to initial business combination (the Conversion Amendment ), and (b) the appointment of Richard Thompson and Sharon Youngblood as Class I directors to each serve on the Board for a three-year term expiring at the third succeeding annual general meeting after their appointment, or until their successors have been qualified and appointed.

The Converted Class A shares will remain subject to the existing transfer restrictions on the Class B ordinary shares following such conversions. In connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment, the Sponsor has issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to make monthly deposits directly to the Company s Trust Account of 150,000 per month (each deposit, is a Contribution ). The maximum aggregate amount of all Contributions under the promissory note will not exceed 3,150,000. The Contributions are paid monthly (or a pro-rata portion thereof if less than a full month), beginning on January 11, 2024, and thereafter on the fifteenth day of each subsequent month (or if such fifteenth day is not a business day, on the business day immediately preceding such fifteenth day) until the earlier of (i) the consummation of a Business Combination, and (ii) the end of the Combination Period. The promissory note is non-interest bearing and is payable upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination and if the Business Combination is not consummated, the date of the termination, dissolution, or winding up of the Company as determined in the sole discretion of the Board. On October 2, 2024, the Board determined that in order to make the Company a more attractive partner to sponsors of special purpose acquisition companies seeking to take over the management and affairs of special purpose acquisition companies, following the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders held on November 13, 2024, the Sponsor and any successor to the obligations of the Sponsor are no longer be required to make monthly deposits to the Trust Account of 0.02 for each outstanding Class A ordinary share, up to a maximum of 150,000 per month. The Company received a contribution of 1,350,000 from the Sponsor for the period from January 11, 2024, through September 30, 2024 under the promissory note. Results of Operations As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from January 19, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to our formation and the Initial Public Offering described below and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for and efforts toward completing an initial business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of an initial business combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of approximately 5.9 million, which consisted of approximately 6.5 million in income from investments held in the Trust Account and interest income on the operating account, offset by 616,555 in general and administrative expenses (of which 90,000 was for administrative expenses for related party). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of approximately 8.0 million, which consisted of approximately 8.5 million in income from investments held in the Trust Account and interest income on the operating account, offset by 598,253 in the general and administrative expenses (of which 90,000 was for administrative expenses for related party). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of approximately 2.0 million, which consisted of approximately 2.1 million in income from investments held in the Trust Account and interest income on the operating account, offset by 184,576 in general and administrative expenses (of which 30,000 was for administrative expenses for the related party). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of approximately 3.0 million, which consisted of approximately 3.2 million in income from investments held in the Trust Account and interest income on operating account, offset by 211,375 in the general and administrative expenses (of which 30,000 was for administrative expenses for related party).

 Going Concern Consideration As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 0.7 million in cash held outside of the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of approximately 0.8 million. The Company s liquidity needs to date were satisfied through the payment of 25,000 from the Sponsor to cover for certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for issuance of the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4), and loan from the Sponsor of approximately 269,000 under the Note (as defined in Note 4) and the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. The Company repaid the Note in full on October 18, 2022. In addition, in order to finance the transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Company s founding team, or any of their affiliates may provide the Company with Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 4) as may be required (of which up to 1.5 million may be converted at the lender s option into warrants). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no Working Capital Loan outstanding. Based on the current operating plan, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital to meet its working capital needs through the earlier of consummation of an initial Business Combination or mandatory liquidation date. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. Management plans to complete the initial Business Combination prior to the mandatory liquidation date and expects to receive financing from the Sponsor or the affiliates of the Sponsor to meet its obligations through the time of liquidation or the completion of the initial Business Combination. There is no financing that is currently committed and no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate the initial Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period (by October 17, 2025). The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. Risks and Uncertainties In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. On October 7, 2023, the State of Israel was attacked by Hamas, a Palestinian militant group designated as a Foreign Terrorist organization by the U.S. Department of State. As a result of this attack, the State of Israel has commenced a military operation against Hamas which is supported by various nations including the United States. The impact of the above actions on the world economy is not determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The specific impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The Company s ability to consummate an initial business combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates an initial business combination, may be materially and adversely affected by these military actions and related sanctions. In addition, the Company s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or ability to consummate an initial business combination are not yet determinable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Contractual Obligations Administrative Services Agreement On October 12, 2022, we entered into an agreement with our Sponsor, pursuant to which we agreed to pay our Sponsor an amount of 10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of the management team through the earlier of consummation of the initial business combination and the liquidation. We incurred 30,000 and 90,000 in such fees included as general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company had unpaid fees of 90,000 as of September 30, 2024 and 30,000 as of December 31, 2023. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors, or their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable initial business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to the Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the Trust Account. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no expenses to be reimbursed. Shareholder and Registration Rights The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans), are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the registration and shareholder rights agreement. These holders are entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the termination of the applicable lock-up period. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or 4.6 million in the aggregate, which was paid in connection with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. An additional fee of 0.35 per Unit, or approximately 8.1 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On September 30, 2024, one of the underwriters in the Initial Public Offering, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., elected to waive its rights to receive its portion of the deferred underwriting commission. This portion accounted for approximately 5.2 million of the total deferred underwriting commission liability of 8.0 million. On October 18, 2024, one of the underwriters in the Initial Public Offering, Guggenheim Securities, elected to waive its rights to receive its portion of the deferred underwriting commission amounting to 2.8 million. Therefore, as of October 18, 2024, the total amount of deferred underwriting commission of 8.0 million was waived. Non-Redemption Agreements On October 24, 2024, October 25, 2024, November 8, 2024, November 11, 2024 and November 12, 2024, in connection with the Company s meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Company and the Company s Sponsor, entered into non-redemption agreements with several unaffiliated third parties, pursuant to which such third parties agreed not to redeem (or to validly rescind any redemption requests on) an aggregate of 2,075,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 of the Company in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal. In exchange for the foregoing commitments not to redeem such Class A ordinary shares of the Company, the Sponsor agreed to transfer or cause to be issued for no consideration an aggregate of 691,666 Founder Shares of the Company on the occurrence of an initial business combination.

 Deferred Legal Fees The Company engaged a legal counsel firm for legal advisory services, and the legal counsel agreed to defer a portion of their fees Deferred Legal Fees ). The deferred fee will become payable solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had Deferred Legal Fees of approximately 1,320,000 and 1,054,000 in connection with such services, respectively. The Company will recognize an expense for these services when the performance trigger is considered probable. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies: Redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares All of the 23,000,000 Class A ordinary shares sold as parts of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature. In accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480-10-S99-3A, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities , redemption provisions not solely within the control of our company require the security to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. We classified all of the Class A ordinary shares as redeemable. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we recognized a charge against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit for the difference between the initial carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares and the redemption value. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Such changes are reflected in retained earnings, or in the absence of retained earnings, in additional paid-in capital. Net Income per Ordinary Share We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. We have three classes of shares, which are referred to as: (i) Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption (consisting of 14,637,766 publicly held Class A ordinary shares); (ii) Class A ordinary shares not subject to redemption (consisting of 7,666,666 Class A ordinary shares held by the Sponsor and the Company s independent directors); and (iii) Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the three classes of shares. Any of the Company s Class B ordinary shares that are converted into Class A ordinary shares on one-for-one basis, herein after referred to as the Converted Class A shares . Net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. Remeasurement associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from net income (loss) per ordinary share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Therefore, the net income (loss) per ordinary share calculation allocates income shared pro rata between Class A and Class B ordinary shares. We have not considered the effect of the exercise of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 24,850,000 shares and the effect of the Rights to receive 2,300,000 shares in the calculation of diluted income per ordinary share, since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. Derivative Financial Instruments We evaluate our equity-linked financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. For derivative financial instruments that are classified as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recognized at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the unaudited condensed statements of operations each reporting period. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be classified as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.

 Upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement on October 17, 2022, we accounted for the Rights and warrants to be issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that the Rights and warrants described above are not precluded from equity classification. Equity-classified contracts are initially measured at fair value (or allocated value). Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized as long as the instruments continue to be classified in equity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . The ASU requires companies to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities relating to contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, an acquirer generally recognized assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. The ASU results in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC 606. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2023, using a prospective method, and the adoption did not have any impact on the audited financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 also requires additional disclosures regarding significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity s portfolio. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance with effect from January 1, 2023. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed financial statements. In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, to clarify the guidance in Topic 820 when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2022-03 require certain additional disclosures related to investments in equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 will become effective for us as of the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. As of September 30, 2024, we do not hold any investments in equity securities, therefore we do not currently expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. This update is effective beginning with the Company s 2024 fiscal year annual reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its condensed financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective for us as of the beginning of our 2026 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact on our financial position and the results of operations. Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, the Company will adopt those that are applicable.

 JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. As an emerging growth company , we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. This Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, which is covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and any of the risks described in our final prospectus for our Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on October 14, 2022. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus for our Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on October 14, 2022, except for the below risk factor. Changes in laws or regulations, or in how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, investments and results of operations. We are subject to laws and regulations, and interpretations and applications of such laws and regulations, enacted by national, regional, and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations, and interpretations and applications of such laws and regulations, may be difficult, time-consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments, and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, investments, and results of operations. On March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules (the SPAC Rule Proposals relating to, among other items, enhancing disclosures in business combination transactions involving special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, and private operating companies; amending the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including a proposed rule that would provide a safe harbor for such companies from the definition of investment company under the Investment Company Act, provided certain criteria are satisfied. On January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules and guidance (the Final Rules relating to special purpose acquisition companies, regarding, among other things, disclosure in SEC filings in connection with initial business combination transactions; the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of projections in SEC filings in connection with a proposed business combination transaction; and the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions. These Final Rules may materially adversely affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. The need for compliance with the Final Rules may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate our company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose. Were we to liquidate our company, our stockholders would not be able to realize the benefits of owning stock in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our stock and warrants following such a transaction, and our warrants would expire worthless.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities On January 26, 2021, the Sponsor paid 25,000, or approximately 0.004 per share, to cover certain expenses on our behalf in consideration of 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001. In February 2021, the Sponsor transferred 40,000 Class B ordinary shares to each of the independent directors. On March 18, 2022, the Company effectuated a share capitalization with respect to its Class B ordinary shares of 1,916,667 shares thereof, resulting in the Company s initial shareholders holding an aggregate of 7,666,667 Founder Shares. The Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 Founder Shares to the extent that the option to purchase additional Units was not exercised in full by the underwriters or was reduced so that the Founder Shares would represent 25 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. The 120,000 Founder Shares held by the Company s independent directors were not subject to forfeiture in the event the underwriters over-allotment was not exercised. On October 17, 2022, the underwriter consummated the exercise in full of the over-allotment; thus, these 1,000,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. On January 25, 2024, the Sponsor and the independent directors of the Company each voluntarily elected to convert 7,546,666 and 120,000 of their Founder Shares, respectively, to Class A ordinary shares, in each case, on a one-for-one basis in accordance with the articles. After giving effect to the Founder Share Conversion, the number of Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding consists of one Sponsor-held Class B ordinary share. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 13,350,000 Private Placement Warrants, including 1,050,000 additional Private Placement Warrants to cover over-allotments, at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of approximately 13.4 million, in a Private Placement to the Sponsor. Use of Proceeds In connection with the Initial Public Offering, the Company incurred offering costs of approximately 13.4 million (including deferred underwriting commissions of 8.1 million). Other incurred offering costs consisted principally of preparation fees related to the Initial Public Offering. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion, which amount will be payable upon consummation of the initial Business Combination, if consummated) and the Initial Public Offering expenses, 235.8 million (or 10.25 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering) of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds from the Private Placement of the Private Placement Warrants were placed in the Trust Account. The net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants are held in the Trust Account and invested as described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There has been no material change in the planned use of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as described in the Company s final prospectus related to the Initial Public Offering. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies During the three months ended September 30, 2024, of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
