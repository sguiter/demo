 . As the Company has a December 31 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory
federal rate of for the Company s fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. Accordingly, the Company has remeasured the Company s
deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards NOLs in the U.S at the lower enacted cooperated tax rate of .
However, this remeasurement has no effect on the Company s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a valuation allowance
on its deferred tax assets previously. 

Additionally, the Act imposes a one-time transition
tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. The
change in rate has caused the Company to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and NOLs
and recorded one time income tax payable to be paid in 8 years. However, this one-time transition tax has no effect on the Company s
income tax expenses as the Company has no undistributed foreign earnings prior to September 30, 2024 which the Company has foreign cumulative
losses at September 30, 2024.

The Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740
related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes
a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions that the company has taken or expects
to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination
by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the net benefit recognized
and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits. A liability is recognized (or amount
of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise s
potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions
of ASC 740.

Net Revenues. Our net revenues for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 1.81 million, which represents a decrease of approximately 1.71 million, or
49 , from 3.52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue can be attributed to the stagnant
sales of high-grade synthetic fuel products, which decreased from 2.57 million to 1.43 million during the current period, and a
decline in beef products sales from 0.84 million to 0.34 million. 

Cost of Revenues. During the three months
ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a decrease in cost of revenue of 1,69 million or 50 , in comparison to the three months ended
September 30, 2023, from approximately 3.39 million to 1.70 million. This change was mainly due to a decrease in sales of revenue, as
discussed above. 

Gross Profit . Our gross profit for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.01 million, representing a 13 decrease to 0.12 million compared to 0.13 million
for the same period in 2023. The decrease was attributed to a decrease in sales of revenue, as discussed above.

Operating Expenses 

Selling and Marketing
Expenses. Our selling and marketing expenses decreased by 0.20 million, or 87 , to 0.03 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024 from 0.23 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to the aforementioned reasons,
attributable to a decrease in sales of revenue. The selling and marketing expenses mainly come from transportation and storage cost and
the sales staff salaries cost decline. 

General and Administrative
Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased slightly by 0.03 million, or
2 , to 1.15 million compared to the previous year s 1.18 million for the same period. 

Net Income 

Our net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2024 decreased by 0.09 million, to 1.19 million from 1.28 million in the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributed
to the decrease of selling and marketing expenses, as discussed above. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared
to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the company s audited consolidated financial statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 and related notes

Net Revenues . Our net revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.29 million, representing a decrease of approximately 10.16 million or 66 from the same period
last year s 15.44 million. The decrease in revenue can be attributed to the stagnant sales of high-grade synthetic fuel products,
which decreased from 6.85 million to 3.36 million during the current period, and a decline in food product sales from 8.14 million
to 1.34 million. 

Cost of Revenues. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a decrease in cost of revenue of 10.23 million or 68 , in comparison to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, from approximately 14.97 million to 4.74 million. This change was mainly due to a decrease in revenue, as discussed
above. 

Gross Profit . Our gross profit for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.08 million, representing a 16 increase to 0.55 million compared to 0.47 million
for the same period in 2023. The growth is primarily attributed to the significant increase in advertising revenue from the Fast branch,
which operates at an approximate gross profit rate of 100 . 

3 

Operating Expenses 

Selling and Marketing Expenses. Our selling
and marketing expenses decreased by 0.61 million, or 85 , to 0.11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.72 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to the aforementioned reasons, attributable to a decrease in
sales of revenue. 

General and Administrative
Expenses . Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.33 million, or 10 ,
to 3.58 million compared to the previous year s 3.25 million for the same period. The decrease was primarily due to increase in
allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of 0.22 million. 

Net Loss 

Our net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 decreased by 10.78 million, or 73 , to 3.99 million from 14.76 million in the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily
attributed to the loss on disposal of equity investments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze
our cash-on-hand and operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs meet our working capital requirements, operating
expenses, and capital expenditure obligations. In the reporting period at September 30, 2024, our primary sources of financing have been
cash generated from operations and private placements. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents of 227,492 compared to 270,317 as of December 31, 2023. The debt to assets ratio was 63.0 and 54.4 as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We expect to continue to finance our operations and working capital needs in 2024 from cash
generated from operations and, if needed, private financings. Suppose available liquidity is insufficient to meet our operating and loan
obligations as they come due. In that case, our plans include pursuing alternative financing arrangements or reducing expenditures as
necessary to meet our cash requirements. However, there is no assurance that we will raise additional capital or reduce discretionary
spending to provide liquidity if needed. We cannot be sure of the availability or terms of any alternative financing arrangements. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the Company has incurred a net loss of 4,342,017
from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had an accumulated deficit
of 144,711,504, a working capital deficit of 8,938,115, its net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 48,461. 

These factors raise substantial doubt on the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management s plan for the Company s continued existence is dependent upon
management s ability to execute the business plan, develop the plan to generate profit; additionally, Management may need to continue
to rely on private placements or certain related parties to provide funding for investment, for working capital and general corporate
purposes. If management is unable to execute its plan, the Company may become insolvent.

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was
 0.05 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 4.18 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily due to increase in net operating assets and liabilities of 4.56 million
and was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations of 0.16 million. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 0.02
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.70 million provided by investing activities for the same period in
2023. This change is primarily due to a reduction in proceeds from disposal of equity method investments of 2.77 million compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing Activities 

The net cash used in financing activities was
 0.10 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1.47 million for
the same period in 2023. This change can be attributed to a rise in loan to related parties. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with the United States generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes to that, and related disclosures of commitments contingencies,
if any. 

We consider our critical accounting policies to
require the more significant judgments and estimates in preparing financial statements, including those outlined in Note 2 to the financial
statements included herein. 

The Company has evaluated the timing and the impact
of the guidance above on the financial statements. 

As of September 30, 2024, there were no other
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would or could have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance arrangements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required
to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under
the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We have identified a material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, relating to ineffective review and approval procedures over journal
entries and financial statement preparation which resulted in errors not being timely identified in prior period financial statements,
such as the overstatement of income of our discontinued operation and other errors in connection with the disposal of Allinyson Ltd.,
our wholly-owned subsidiary, on April 1, 2024. We concluded that the failure to timely identify such accounting errors constituted material
weakness as defined in the SEC regulations. As such, management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

To respond to this material weakness, we have
devoted, and plan to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of our internal control over
financial reporting. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to enhance
our system of evaluating and implementing the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Our plans at this time
include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel
and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can
only be accomplished over the time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects, or
that any additional material weaknesses or of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain
adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. Even if we are successful in strengthening our
controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors
or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter,
other than as discussed above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
