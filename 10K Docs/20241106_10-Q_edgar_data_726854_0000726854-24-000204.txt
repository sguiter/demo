City National provides credit, deposit, and trust and investment management services to its customers in a broad geographical area that includes many rural and small community markets in addition to larger cities including Charleston (WV), Huntington (WV), Martinsburg (WV), Ashland (KY), Lexington (KY), Winchester (VA) and Staunton (VA). In addition to its branch network, City National's delivery channels include automated-teller-machines ("ATMs"), interactive-teller machines ("ITMs"), mobile banking, debit cards, interactive voice response systems, and Internet technology. The Company s business activities are currently limited to reportable business segment, which is community banking. 
 
 On March 10, 2023, the Company acquired of the outstanding common shares of Citizens Commerce Bancshares, Inc. ("Citizens") and its principal banking subsidiary, Citizens Commerce Bank. See Note C for additional information on the acquisition. 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which are unaudited, include all of the accounts of City Holding and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"). All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial condition for each of the periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Company s accounting and reporting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information, with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Such policies require management to make estimates and develop assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. Actual results could differ from management s estimates. 
 
 The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial statements included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Company.

 Citizen's entire investment portfolio of million was sold shortly after the acquisition date and resulted in a 0.7 million realized gain during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. 
 
 Acquired Loans 
 
 The fair value of net assets acquired includes fair value adjustments to certain receivables that were not considered impaired as of the acquisition date. The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted contractual cash flows. However, the Company believes that there was not deterioration of credit at the date of acquisition. As such, these receivables were not considered impaired at the acquisition date and were not subject to the guidance relating to purchased credit deteriorated loans, which have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination. Receivables acquired that were not subject to these requirements include non-impaired loans with a fair value of million on the date of acquisition. 
 
 In connection with the completion of the acquisition of Citizens during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded million of credit loss expense associated with loans acquired from Citizens in its total provision for credit losses. 
 
 The fair value of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration ("PCD") was million on the date of acquisition. The gross contractual amounts receivable relating to the purchased financial asset with credit deterioration was

 million. The Company estimates, on the date of acquisition, that million of the contractual cash flows specific to the purchased financial assets with credit deterioration will not be collected. 
 
 Acquired Deposits 
 
 The fair values of non-time deposits approximated their carrying value at the acquisition date. For time deposits, the fair values were estimated based on discounted cash flows, using interest rates that were being offered at the time of acquisition compared to the contractual interest rates. Based on this analysis, management recorded a premium on time deposits acquired of million which is being amortized over years. 
 
 Core Deposit Intangible 
 
 The Company believes that the customer relationships with the deposits acquired have an intangible value. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded a core deposit intangible asset of million. The core deposit intangible asset represents the value that the acquiree had with their deposit customers. The fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered the type of deposit, deposit retention and the cost of the deposit base. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over years. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Under GAAP, management has up to twelve months following the date of the acquisition to finalize the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The measurement period ends as soon as the Company receives information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not obtainable. Any subsequent adjustments to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, intangible assets or other purchase accounting adjustments will result in adjustments to the goodwill recorded. As of September 30, 2024, over twelve months have occurred since the date of acquisition on March 10, 2023, and the measurement period is now complete.

 The Company's other investment securities include marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities held for investment. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held million and million, respectively, in marketable equity securities. Changes in the fair value of the marketable equity securities are recorded in "unrealized gains recognized on equity securities still held" in the consolidated statements of income. The Co mpany's non-marketable securities consist of securities with limited marketability, such as stock in the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") or the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB"). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held million and million, respectively, in non-marketable equity securities. These securities are carried at cost due to the restrictions placed on their transferability. The Company held certificates of deposits for investment at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The majority of the Company's investment securities are mortgage-backed. These securities are collateralized by both residential and commercial properties. The mortgage-backed securities in which the Company has invested are predominantly issued by government-sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were securities of any non-governmental issuer whose aggregate carrying value or estimated fair value exceeded 10 of shareholders' equity. 
 
 Certain investment securities owned by the Company were in an unrealized loss position (i.e., amortized cost basis exceeded the estimated fair value of the securities) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 As of September 30, 2024, management does not intend to sell any impaired security and it is not more than likely that it will be required to sell any impaired security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. The unrealized losses on debt securities are primarily the result of interest rate changes, credit spread fluctuations on agency-issued mortgage-related securities, general financial market uncertainty and market volatility. These conditions should not prohibit the Company from receiving its contractual principal and interest payments on its debt securities. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities a pproach their maturity date or repricing date. Due to the previously mentioned factors, as of September 30, 2024, management believes the unrealized losses detailed in the table above are temporary and therefore allowance for credit losses has been recognized on the Company s securities. Should the impairment of any of these securities become other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss will be recognized in net income in the period the other-than-temporary impairment is identified, while any noncredit loss will be recognized in other comprehensive income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had credit-related net investment impairment losses.

 The Company s commercial and residential real estate construction loans are primarily secured by real estate within the Company s principal markets. These loans were originated under the Company s loan policies, which are focused on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, including construction loans. In the judgment of the Company's management, adequate consideration has been given to these loans in establishing the Company's allowance for credit losses (see Note F for additional information).

 Management systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis to provide for expected losses inherent in the portfolio. Management assesses the risk in each loan type based on historica l trends, the general economic environment of its local markets, individual loan performance and other relevant factors. The Company's estimate of future economic conditions utilized in its provision estimate is primarily dependent on expected unemployment ranges over a two-year period. Beyond two years, a straight line reversion to historical average loss rates is applied over the life of the loan pool in the migration methodology. The vintage methodology applies future average loss rates based on net losses in historical periods where the unemployment rate was within the forecasted range.

 million are selected at least annually for detailed loan reviews, which are utilized by management to assess the risk in the portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance. 
 
 Non-Performing Loans 
 
 Interest income on loans is accrued and credited to operations based upon the principal amount outstanding, using methods that generally result in level rates of return. Loan origination fees, and certain direct costs, are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield over the term of the loan. The accrual of interest generally is discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to principal or interest for all loan types. However, any loan may be placed on non-accrual status if the Company receives information that indicates a borrower is unable to meet the contractual terms of its respective loan agreement. Other indicators considered for placing a loan on non-accrual status include the borrower s involvement in bankruptcies, foreclosures, repossessions, litigation and any other situation resulting in doubt as to whether full collection of contractual principal and interest is attainable. When interest accruals are discontinued, unpaid interest recognized in income in the current year is reversed, and interest accrued in prior years is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the net realizable value of collateral exceeds the principal balance and related accrued interest, and the loan is in the process of collection. 
 
 Generally for all loan classes, interest income during the period the loan is non-performing is recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Cash payments received on nonperforming loans are typically applied directly against the outstanding principal balance until the loan is fully repaid. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, the borrower has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

 The Company recognized interest income on non-accrual loans during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

As of September 30, 2024, the company had one commercial and industrial loan and three owner occupied commercial real estate loans that were considered individually evaluated collateral-dependent loans totaling million. The company had one commercial and industrial individually evaluated collateral dependent loan recorded at million as of December 31, 2023. Changes in the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans are reported as a provision for credit loss or a recovery of credit loss in the period of change. 
 
 Generally, all loan types are considered past due when the contractual terms of a loan are not met and the borrower is days or more past due on a payment. Furthermore, residential and home equity loans are generally subject to charge-off when the loan becomes days past due, depending on the estimated fair value of the collateral less cost to dispose, versus the outstanding loan balance. Commercial loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes days past due. Open-end consumer loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes days past due.

 Loan Restructurings 
 
 The Company evaluates all loan restructurings in accordance with ASU No. 2022-02 for loan modifications to determine if the restructuring results in a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that result in a direct change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows include situations where there is principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions, and combinations of the listed modifications. Therefore, the disclosures related to loan restructurings are only for modifications that directly affect cash flows. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company had

 million. The Company had loan modifications that were considered restructured loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 A loan that is considered a restructured loan may be subject to the individually evaluated loan analysis, otherwise, the restructured loan will remain in the appropriate segment in the Allowance for Credit Losses model and associated reserves will be adjusted based on changes in the discounted cash flows resulting from the modification of the restructured loan. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 All commercial loans within the portfolio are subject to internal risk rating. All non-commercial loans are evaluated based on payment history. The Company s internal risk ratings for commercial loans are: Exceptional, Good, Acceptable, Pass/Watch, Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Each internal risk rating is defined in the loan policy using the following criteria: balance sheet yields; ratios and leverage; cash flow spread and coverage; prior history; capability of management; market position/industry; potential impact of changing economic, legal, regulatory or environmental conditions; purpose; structure; collateral support; and guarantor support. Risk grades are generally assigned by the primary lending officer and are periodically evaluated by the Company s internal loan review process. Based on an individual loan s risk grade, estimated loss percentages are applied to the outstanding balance of the loan to determine the amount of expected loss. 
 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information regarding the customer s debt service ability, capacity and overall collateral position, along with other economic trends and historical payment performance. The risk rating for each credit is updated when the Company receives current financial information, the loan is reviewed by the Company s internal loan review and credit administration departments, or the loan becomes delinquent or impaired. The risk grades are updated a minimum of annually for loans rated Exceptional, Good, Acceptable, or Pass/Watch. Loans rated Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful are reviewed at least quarterly. The Company uses the following definitions for its risk ratings: 
 
 Risk Rating Description Pass Ratings: (a) Exceptional Loans classified as exceptional are secured with liquid collateral conforming to the internal loan policy. Loans rated within this category pose minimal risk of loss to the bank. (b) Good Loans classified as good have similar characteristics that include a strong balance sheet, satisfactory debt service coverage ratios, strong management and/or guarantors, and little exposure to economic cycles. Loans in this category generally have a low chance of loss to the bank. (c) Acceptable Loans classified as acceptable have acceptable liquidity levels, adequate debt service coverage ratios, experienced management, and have average exposure to economic cycles. Loans within this category generally have a low risk of loss to the bank. (d) Pass/watch Loans classified as pass/watch have erratic levels of leverage and/or liquidity, cash flow is volatile and the borrower is subject to moderate economic risk. A borrower in this category poses a low to moderate risk of loss to the bank. Special mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness(es) that deserves management s close attention. The potential weakness could result in deterioration of the loan repayment or the bank s credit position at some future date. A loan rated in this category poses a moderate loss risk to the bank. Substandard Loans classified as substandard reflect a customer with a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. Loans in this category have the possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and the bank s collateral value is weakened by the financial deterioration of the borrower. Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristics that make collection of the full contract amount highly improbable. Loans rated in this category are most likely to cause the bank to have a loss due to a collateral shortfall or a negative capital position.

 No transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) include individually evaluated loans that were remeasured and reported at fair value through a specific valuation allowance allocation of the allowance for credit losses based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral (in thousands). The fair value of individually evaluated loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans primarily relate to discounts applied to the customers reported amount of collateral. The amount of collateral discount depends upon the marketability of the underlying collateral. Generally, the Company has applied collateral discounts, ranging from to . As of September 30, 2024, the company had one commercial and industrial loan and three owner occupied commercial real estate loans that were considered individually evaluated collateral-dependent loans totaling million. The Company had one commercial and industrial individually evaluated collateral dependent loan recorded at million as of December 31, 2023. The Company had no Level 2 financial assets and liabilities that were measured on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 or as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities 
 
 The Company has no non-financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include other real estate owned OREO ), which is measured at the lower of cost or fair value. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 ASC Topic 825 Financial Instruments, as amended, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimate of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. ASC Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.

 Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The accounting policies of the Company conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require management to make estimates and develop assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnotes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available to management as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from management s estimates. As this information changes, management s estimates and assumptions used to prepare the Company s financial statements and related disclosures may also change. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note One to the audited financial statements included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Company. Based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified: (i) the determination of the allowance for credit losses (ii) income taxes and (iii) acquisition and preliminary purchase price accounting to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off in the future. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors. These evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more frequently if deemed necessary. Additionally, all commercial loans within the portfolio are subject to internal risk grading. Risk grades are generally assigned by the primary lending officer and are periodically evaluated by the Company s internal loan review process. 
 
 In evaluating the appropriateness of its allowance for credit losses, the Company stratifies the loan portfolio into six major groupings. The Company has identified the following portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods: 
 Portfolio Segment Measurement Method Commercial and industrial Migration Commercial real estate: 1-4 family Migration Hotels Migration Multi-family Migration Non Residential Non-Owner Occupied Migration Non Residential Owner Occupied Migration Residential real estate Vintage Home equity Vintage Consumer Vintage 
 
 Migration is an analysis that tracks a closed pool of loans for a configurable period of time and calculates a loss ratio on only those loans in the pool at the start date based on outstanding balance. Vintage is a predictive loss model that includes a reasonable approximation of probable and estimable future losses by tracking each loan's net losses over the life of the loan as compared to its original balance. For demand deposit overdrafts, the allowance for credit losses is measured using the historical loss rate. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not

 included in the collective evaluation. When management determines that foreclosure is probable, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. 
 
 Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a restructured loan will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and a re not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. 
 
 The Company uses a number of economic variables in its scenarios to estimate the Allowance for credit losses (ACL), with the most significant drivers being an unemployment rate forecast and qualitative adjustments. In the September 30, 2024 estimate, the Company assumed a 2-year unemployment forecast range of 4.3 to 4.9 , changed from 4.0 to 4.7 for the June 30, 2024 estimate. Historical loss rates from periods where the average unemployment rate matches the forecast range are considered when calculating the forecast period loss rate. In total, the changes in loss rates increased the reserve 0.2 million for the quarter. 
 
 Based on sensitivity analysis of all portfolios, a 0.0050 change (slight improvement or decline on bank's scale) in all 11 qualitative risk factors (where assigned) would have a 2.2 million impact on the reserve allocation. Changing each factor by 0.01 (moderate improvement or decline) would have a 4.3 million, impact. Management recognizes that these are extreme scenarios and it is very unlikely that all risk factors would change by 0.005 or 0.01 simultaneously. For the September 30, 2024 estimate, no changes were made to the qualitative factors utilized in the previous quarter. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In computing the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments regarding interpretation of laws in those jurisdictions. Because the application of tax laws and regulations for many types of transactions is susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the financial statements could be changed at a later date upon final determinations by taxing authorities. On a quarterly basis, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate for the year and uses that rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change over the next twelve months as a result of various factors. However, management cannot currently estimate the range of possible change. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and forward. 
 
 The effective tax rate is calculated by taking the statutory rate and adjusting for permanent and discrete items. The discrete items can vary between periods but historically have remained consistent. 
 
 Acquisition and Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation 
 
 The calculation of the Company's acquisition and preliminary purchase price allocation is considered a critical accounting estimate as it involves a significant level of estimation and uncertainty, particularly in relation to the fair value and goodwill calculations. Under GAAP, management has up to twelve months following the date of the acquisition to finalize the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The measurement period ends as soon as the Company receives information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not obtainable. Any subsequent adjustments to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, intangible assets or other purchase accounting adjustments will result in adjustments to the goodwill recorded. As of September 30, 2024 , over twelve months have occurred since the date of acquisition on March 10, 2023, and the measurement period is now complete.

The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities (91 basis points) and increase in average balance of interest bearing liabilities 34.7 million), which decreased net interest income by 22.9 million and 4.5 million, respectively. Additionally, a decrease in the average balance of deposits in depository institutions 46.5 million) decreased interest income by 1.5 million. 
 
 These decreases were essentially offset by increases in the Federal Funds rate since the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which increased net interest income by 18.3 million due to an increase in loan yields (net of loan fees and accretion) of 62 basis points. Net interest income increased 4.7 million due to an increase in investment yields of 44 basis points and an increase in average loans 92.0 million) which increased interest income by 3.3 million. In addition, an increase of 110 basis points in the yield on deposits in depository institutions increased net interest income by 1.0 million. The Company s reported net interest margin decreased from 4.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Net Interest Income 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 The Company s net interest income was 55.6 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s tax equivalent net interest income decreased approximately 0.1 million, from 55.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 55.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The Company's net interest income declined by 5.7 million due to an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities of 65 basis points and by 2.0 million due to an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 217.0 million). 
 
 These decreases in net interest income were essentially offset by an increase in loan yields (35 basis points) and an increase in average loan balances 176.6 million), which increased net interest income 3.4 million and 2.5 million, respectively. In addition, an increase of 37 basis points in the yield on investment securities increased net interest income by 1.3 million. The Company s reported net interest margin decreased from 4.03 for the third quarter of 2023 to 3.87 for the third quarter of 2024.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Management of the Company uses measures in its analysis of the Company's performance other than those in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). These measures are useful when evaluating the underlying performance of the Company's operations. The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP measures enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. The Company's management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial performance without the impact of those items that may obscure trends in the Company's performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other companies. The following table reconciles fully taxable equivalent net interest income with net interest income as derived from the Company's financial statements, as well as other non-GAAP measures (dollars in thousands):

 Loan balances increased 31.9 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 
 The commercial and industrial ("C I") loan portfolio consists of loans to corporate borrowers that are primarily in small to mid-size industrial and commercial companies. Collateral securing these loans includes equipment, machinery, inventory, receivables and vehicles. C I loans are considered to contain a higher level of risk than other loan types, although care is taken to minimize these risks. Num erous risk factors impact this portfolio, including industry specific risks such as the economy, new technology, labor rates and cyclicality, as well as customer specific factors, such as cash flow, financial structure, operating controls and asset quality. C I loans decreased 2.5 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 
 Commercial real estate loans consist of commercial mortgages, which generally are secured by nonresidential and multi-family residential properties, including hotel/motel and apartment lending. Commercial real estate loans are made to many of the same customers and carry similar industry risks as C I loans. Commercial real estate loans increased 0.4 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, 2.7 million of the commercial real estate loans were for commercial properties under construction. 
 
 In order to group loans with similar risk characteristics, the portfolio is further segmented by product types: 
 
 Commercial 1-4 Family loans decreased 11.6 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Commercial 1-4 Family loans consist of residential single-family, duplex, triplex, and fourplex rental properties and totaled 194.7 million as of September 30, 2024. Risk characteristics are driven by rental housing demand as well as economic and employment conditions. These properties exhibit greater risk than multi-family properties due to fewer income sources. 
 Hotel loans increased 26.1 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The Hotel portfolio is comprised of all lodging establishments and totaled 383.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Risk characteristics relate to the demand for travel. 
 Multi-family loans increased 4.7 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Multi-family consists of 5 or more family residential apartment lending. The portfolio totaled 193.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Risk characteristics are driven by rental housing demand as well as economic and employment conditions. 
 Non-residential commercial real estate includes properties such as retail, office, warehouse, storage, healthcare, entertainment, religious, and other nonresidential commercial properties. The non-residential product type is further segmented into owner- and non-owner occupied properties. Nonresidential non-owner occupied commercial real estate totaled 665.2 million at September 30, 2024 and decreased 15.4 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 2024. Nonresidential owner-occupied commercial real estate totaled 236.8 million at September 30, 2024 and decreased 3.5 million from December 31, 2023. Risk characteristics relate to levels of consumer spending and overall economic conditions. 
 
 Residential real estate loans increased 18.4 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Residential real estate loans represent loans to consumers that are secured by a first lien on residential property. Residential real estate loans provide for the purchase or refinance of a residence and first-lien home equity loans allow consumers to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans primarily consist of single family 3, 5 and 7 year adjustable rate mortgages with terms that amortize up to 30 years. The Company also offers fixed-rate residential real estate loans that are generally sold in the secondary market that are not included on the Company's balance sheet; the Company does not retain the servicing rights to these loans. Residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten to comply with Fannie Mae guidelines, while the home equity loans are underwritten with typically less documentation, but with lower loan-to-value ratios and shorter maturities. At September 30, 2024, 7.6 million of the residential real estate loans were for properties under construction. 
 
 Home equity loans increased 22.9 million during the first nine months of 2024. The Company's home equity loans represent loans to consumers that are secured by a second (or junior) lien on a residential property. Home equity loans allow consumers to borrow against the equity in their home without paying off an existing first lien. These loans consist of home equity lines of credit ("HELOC") and amortized home equity loans that require monthly installment payments. Home equity loans are underwritten with less documentation, lower loan-to-value ratios and for shorter terms than residential mortgage loans. The amount of credit extended is directly related to the value of the real estate at the time the loan is made. 
 
 Consumer loans may be secured by automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles and other personal property or they may b e unsecured. The Company monitors the risk associated with these types of loans by monitoring such factors as portfolio growth, lending policies and economic conditions. Underwriting standards are continually evaluated and modified based upon these factors. Consumer loans decreased by 6.5 million during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 Management systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis to provide for expected losses inherent in the portfolio. Management assesses the risk in each loan type based on historical trends, the general economic environment of its local markets, individual loan performance and other relevant factors. The Company's estimate of future economic conditions utilized in its provision estimate is primarily dependent on expected unemployment ranges over a two-year period. Beyond two years, a straight line reversion to historical average loss rates is applied over the life of the loan pool in the migration methodology. The vintage methodology applies future average loss rates based on net losses in historical periods where the unemployment rate was within the forecasted range. As a result of the Company s quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the Allowance for Credit Losses, the Company recorded a 1.2 million provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 and recorded a provision for credit losses of 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Individual credits in excess of 1 million are selected at least annually for detailed loan reviews, which are utilized by management to assess the risk in the portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance. 
 
 Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses is subjective in nature and requires management to periodically reassess the validity of its assumptions. Differences between actual losses and estimated losses are assessed such that management can timely modify its evaluation model to ensure that adequate provision has been made for risk in the total loan portfolio. 
 
 Based on the Company s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and in consideration of the known factors utilized in computing the allowance, management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 is adequate to provide for expected losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio. Future provisions for credit losses will be dependent upon trends in loan balances including the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in loan quality and loss experience trends, and recoveries of previously charged-off loans, among other factors.

 Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is shown in the table below (in thousands). The allocation of a portion of the allowance in one portfolio loan classification does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other portfolio segments. As of September 30, As of December 31, 2024 2023 2023 Commercial and industrial 4,520 4,648 4,474 1-4 Family 1,234 662 1,402 Hotels 2,240 2,220 2,211 Multi-family 997 1,015 1,002 Non Residential Non-Owner Occupied 3,037 4,798 4,077 Non Residential Owner Occupied 2,130 2,464 2,453 Commercial real estate 9,638 11,159 11,145 Residential real estate 5,891 5,391 5,398 Home equity 624 432 490 Consumer 326 325 269 DDA overdrafts 833 1,173 969 Allowance for Credit Losses 21,832 23,128 22,745 
 
 The Allowance for Credit Losses decreased slightly from 22.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 21.8 million at September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 1.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of 0.2 million for the comparable period in 2023, and a provision for credit losses of 0.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses in the third quarter was primarily related to a commercial loan for a movie theater that had been originated in September 2014. The loan had paid according to terms but cash flows began deteriorating during the COVID-19 crisis which began in 2020. Due to further operating weaknesses during 2024, the loan was transferred to nonaccrual status and a 2.0 million charge-off was recorded in the quarter ending September 30, 2024, leaving an outstanding balance of approximately 6.7 million. The Company has only one other loan to a movie theater and the outstanding balance of that performing loan is under 5.0 million. This charge-off was partially offset by a 0.75 million reversal of a reserve on a purchase credit deteriorated loan that was paid-off in full during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 Excluding net investment securities gains, non-interest income increased from 56.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 56.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The increase was largely attributable to an increase in trust and investment management fee income of 1.3 million (18.7 ), an increase in service charges of

 1.0 million (4.6 ), and an increase in bankcard revenue of 0.5 million (2.6 ). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bank owned life insurance of 1.7 million (34.9 and a decrease in other income of 0.7 million (24.7 ). 
 
 Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expenses, less merger related expenses, increased 7.5 million (7.3 ), from 102.8 million in the first nine months of 2023 to 110.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits 2.5 million), other expenses 2.4 million), bankcard expenses 1.2 million), equipment and software related expense 0.7 million), and advertising expense 0.4 million). 
 
 Income Tax Expense: The Company s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.6 compared to 20.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Risk Management 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in current and future cash flows, fair values, earnings or capital due to adverse movements in interest rates and other factors, including foreign exchange rates, underlying credit risk and commodity prices. Because the Company has no significant foreign exchange activities and holds no commodities, interest rate risk represents the primary market risk factor affecting the Company s balance sheet and net interest margin. Significant changes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve could result in similar changes in SOFR interest rates, prime rates, and other benchmark interest rates that could affect the estimated fair value of the Company s investment securities portfolio, interest paid on the Company s short-term and long-term borrowings, interest earned on the Company s loan portfolio and interest paid on its deposit accounts. The Company utilizes derivative instruments, primarily in the form of interest rate swaps, to help manage its interest rate risk on commercial loans. 
 
 The Company s ALCO has been delegated the responsibility of managing the Company s interest-sensitive balance sheet accounts to maximize earnings while managing interest rate risk. ALCO, comprised of various members of executive and senior management, is also responsible for establishing policies to monitor and limit the Company s exposure to interest rate risk and to manage the Company s liquidity position. ALCO satisfies its responsibilities through at least quarterly meetings during which product pricing issues, liquidity measures, and interest sensitivity positions are monitored.

Table of Contents 

In order to measure and manage its interest rate risk, the Company uses an asset/liability management and simulation software model to periodically update the interest sensitivity position of the Company s balance sheet. The model is also used to perform analyses that measure the impact on net interest income and capital as a result of various changes in the interest rate environment. Such analyses quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income. 
 
 The Company s policy objective is to avoid negative fluctuations in net income or the economic value of equity of more than 15 within a 12-month period, assuming an immediate parallel increase or decrease of 100 to 300 basis points. The Company measures the long-term risk associated with sustained increases and decreases in rates through analysis of the impact to changes in rates on the economic value of equity. 
 
 The following table summarizes the sensitivity of the Company s net income to various interest rate scenarios. The results of the sensitivity analyses presented below differ from the results used internally by ALCO in that, in the analyses below, interest rates are assumed to have an immediate and sustained parallel shock. The Company recognizes that rates are volatile, but rarely move with immediate and parallel effects. Internally, the Company considers a variety of interest rate scenarios that are deemed possible while considering the level of risk it is willing to assume in worst-case scenarios such as shown by the following: 
 Immediate Basis Point Change in Interest Rates Implied Federal Funds Rate Associated with Change in Interest Rates Estimated Increase or Decrease in Net Income Over 12 Months September 30, 2024 +300 8.00 -1.0 +200 7.00 +0.8 +100 6.00 +2.4 -100 4.00 -4.6 -200 3.00 -10.5 -300 2.00 -17.6 December 31, 2023 +300 8.50 -4.5 +200 7.50 -2.4 +100 6.50 -1.6 -100 4.50 -7.2 -200 3.50 -8.3 -300 2.50 -13.9 
 These estimates are highly dependent upon assumptions made by management, including, but not limited to, assumptions regarding the manner in which interest-bearing demand deposit and savings deposit accounts reprice in different interest rate scenarios, changes in the composition of deposit balances, pricing behavior of competitors, prepayments of loans and deposits under alternative rate environments, and new business volumes and pricing. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates above will be achieved in the event that interest rates increase or decrease during the remainder of 2024 and beyond. The estimates above do not necessarily imply that the Company will experience increases in net income if market interest rates rise. The table above indicates how the Company s net income behaves relative to an increase in rates compared to what would otherwise occur if rates remain stable. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The Company evaluates the adequacy of liquidity at both the City Holding level and at the City National level. At the City Holding level, the principal source of cash is dividends from City National. Dividends paid by City National to City Holding are subject to certain legal and regulatory limitations. Generally, any dividends in amounts that exceed the earnings retained by City National in the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years must be approved by regulatory authorities. At September 30, 2024, City National could pay dividends up to 128.2 million plus net profits for the remainder of 2024, as defined by statute, up to the dividend declaration date without prior regulatory permission.

 Additionally, City Holding anticipates continuing the payment of dividends on its common stock, which are expected to approximate 43.5 million on an annualized basis over the next 12 months based on common shares outstanding at September 30, 2024. However, dividends to shareholders can, if necessary, be suspended. In addition to these anticipated cash needs, City Holding has operating expenses and other contractual obligations, which are estimated to require 1.8 million of additional cash over the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, City Holding reported a cash balance of 19.2 million and management believes that City Holding s available cash balance, together with cash dividends from City National, will be adequate to satisfy its funding and cash needs over the next 12 months. 
 
 As illustrated in the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company generated 98.1 million of cash from operating activities during the first nine months of 2024, primarily from interest income received on loans and investments, net of interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. The Company used 133.2 million of cash in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale securities of 192.6 million, an increase in loans of 30.9 million, payments for low income housing credits of 10.4 million, and purchases of premises and equipment of 1.8 million. These increases were partially offset by proceeds from maturities and calls of 100.4 million and proceeds from the bank-owned life insurance policies of 1.2 million. The Company generated 172.7 million of cash in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024, principally as a result of an increase in interest-bearing deposits of 171.8 million, proceeds from long-term debt of 50.0 million, and an increase in short-term borrowings of 4.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in dividends paid of 31.9 million, purchases of treasury stock of 17.9 million, and a decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits of 3.3 million. 
 
 City National has borrowing facilities with the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank that can be accessed as necessary to fund operations and to provide contingency funding. These borrowing facilities are collateralized by various loans held on City National s balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, City National had the capacity to borrow an additional 1.6 billion from these existing borrowing facilities. In addition, approximately 765 million of City National s investment securities were pledged to collateralize customer repurchase agreements and various deposit accounts, leaving approximately 730 million of City National s investment securities unpledged at September 30, 2024. City National also segregates certain mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment securities in a separate subsidiary so that it can separately monitor the asset quality of these primarily mortgage-related assets, which could be used to raise cash through securitization transactions or obtain additional equity or debt financing if necessary. 
 
 The Company manages its asset and liability mix to balance its desire to maximize net interest income against its desire to minimize risks associated with capitalization, interest rate volatility, and liquidity. Historically, the Company has utilized derivative instruments, when appropriate, to assist this goal. During the year ending December 31, 2020, the Company entered into three 50 million swap agreements that hedged interest rate risk on certain pools of the Company s investment securities. These agreements require the Company to pay rates ranging from 0.20 to 0.24 , while receiving the federal funds effective rate in return. Interest income and changes in market valuations from these swap agreements are recognized as investment income in the accompanying statements of income. These agreements mature in October 50 million) and November 100 million) of 2025. During the year ending December 31, 2023, the Company entered into a 100 million swap agreement that hedged interest rate risk on certain loans of the Company. This agreement requires the Company to pay 3.60 , while receiving SOFR in return. Interest income and changes in market valuations from this swap agreement are recognized as loan interest income in the accompanying statements of income. This agreement matures in March 2026. 
 
 With respect to liquidity, the Company has chosen a conservative posture and believes that its liquidity position is strong. The Company s net loan to asset ratio is 64.3 as of September 30, 2024 and deposit balances fund 79.3 of total assets. The Company has obligations to extend credit, but these obligations are primarily associated with existing home equity loans that have predictable borrowing patterns across the portfolio. The Company has investment security balances with carrying values that totaled 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024, and that exceeded the Company s non-deposit sources of borrowing, which totaled 489.2 million. Further, the Company s deposit mix has a high proportion of transaction and savings accounts that fund 60.6 of the Company s total assets. As interest rates increase, deposit balances may decline or the composition of the deposit portfolio may shift to higher yielding deposit products, such as money market accounts or time deposits. 
 
 As the following table reflects, approximately 15 (estimated) of the Company's deposits were uninsured (either with balances above 250,000 or not collateralized by investment securities) as of September 30, 2024.

 The amounts listed above represent management's best estimate as of the respective period shown of uninsured deposits (either with balances above 250,000 or not collateralized by investment securities). 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Shareholders' equity increased 64.2 million f or the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to net income of 88.4 million and other comprehensive income of 23.7 million. This increase was partially offset by cash dividends declared of 33.0 million, and the repurchase of 178,529 common shares at a weighted average price of 100.24 per share 17.9 million) as part of a one million share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in January 2024. 
 
 The Basel III Capital Rules require City Holding and City National to maintain minimum CET 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios, along with a capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in new minimum capital ratios (which are shown in the table below). The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a countercyclical capital buffer that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company.

 As of September 30, 2024, management believes that City Holding Company and its banking subsidiary, City National, were well capitalized. City Holding is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve, while City National is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). Regulatory agencies can initiate certain mandatory actions if either City Holding or City National fails to meet the minimum capital requirements, as shown above. As of September 30, 2024, management believes that City Holding and City National have met all capital adequacy requirements. 
 
 Depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9 , off balance sheet exposures of 25 or less of total consolidated assets and trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5 or less of total consolidated 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 assets, are deemed qualifying community banking organizations and are eligible to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework. A qualifying community banking organization that elects to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9 is considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III Rules and, if applicable, is considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of its primary federal regulator s prompt corrective action rules. The Company and its subsidiary bank do not have any immediate plans to elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework but may make such an election in the future.
