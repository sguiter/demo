Tax Receivable Agreement 	 Upon the completion of the Business Combination, the Company entered into the TRA with holders of Post-Merger Repay Units. As a result of the TRA, the Company established a liability in its condensed consolidated financial statements. The TRA is recorded at fair value based on estimates of discounted future cash flows associated with the estimated payments to the Post-Merger Repay Unit holders. These inputs are not observable in the market; thus, the TRA is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, under ASC 820. The change in fair value is re-measured at each reporting period with the change in fair value being recognized in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , which is recorded within Change in fair value of tax receivable liability in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company used a discount rate, also referred to as the Early Termination Rate, as defined in the TRA, to determine the prese nt value, based on a risk-free rate plus a spread , pursuant to the TRA. A rate of was applied to the forecasted TRA payments at September 30, 2024, in order to determine the fair value. A significant increase or decrease in the discount rate could have resulted in a lower or higher balance, respectively, as of the measurement date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the TRA balance was adjusted by million through an exchange, a payment, accretion expense and a valuation adjustment, related to a decrease in the income tax rate used to measure the TRA as of the Early Termination Date and a decrease in the discount rate, which was as of December 31, 2023.

Unvested at September 30, 2024 

On May 30, 2024, the Company s Compensation Committee approved two PSU grant agreements, with one vesting based on relative total stock return TSR PSUs and one vesting based on adjusted EBITDA growth EBITDA PSUs ). TSR PSUs are based on a performance condition, such that the Company s total shareholder return relative to a comparator group for the applicable performance period determines the number of shares (if any) that is ultimately issued upon vesting. The grant date fair value of TSR PSUs is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation. Compensation expense of TSR PSUs generally is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. EBITDA PSUs are based on a performance condition, such that the growth of the Company s adjusted EBITDA during each fiscal year within the applicable performance period determines the number of shares (if any) that is ultimately issued upon vesting. The grant date fair value of EBITDA PSUs is based on the quoted market value of the Company s Class A common stock on the grant date. As the Company determines that the performance condition associated with EBITDA PSUs is probable, the attributable compensation expense generally is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. If, in the future, it is determined that achieving the performance condition related to EBITDA PSUs is improbable, the Company would reverse any compensation expense recognized to date associated with EBITDA PSUs.

Expected volatility 

Dividend yield 

Expected term (in years) 

The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity equal to the contractual term of seven years. The assumption on expected volatility was based on the average of historical peer group volatilities using daily prices. The dividend yield assumption was determined as since the Company pays no dividends. Expected term was based on the simplified method outlined in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 14, Share-Based Payment due to the fact that Company does not have sufficient historical data upon which to estimate an expected term. Given that the Company s Class A common stock has been publicly traded for less than seven years, the Company believes that the simplified method is an applicable methodology to estimate the expected term of the options as of the grant date. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On August 18, 2021, the Company s stockholders approved the Repay Holdings Corporation 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees with the opportunity to purchase the Company s Class A common stock through accumulated payroll deductions. A total of shares of the Company s Class A common stock are available for issuance under the ESPP. Under the ESPP, participants are offered the right to purchase shares of the Company s Class A common stock at a discount during a series of offering periods. The length of the offering periods under the ESPP will be determined by the administrator and may be up to twenty-seven months long.

REPAY HOLDINGS CORPORATION Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of million and an income tax benefit of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a stock-based compensation adjustments net tax shortfall of million related to restricted stock awards vesting and a million state rate change impact on deferred taxes. In addition, the effective tax rate includes a net million and a million impact related to cancellation of debt income and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, respectively, associated with the partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes, which are required to be recorded discretely in the interim period in which they occur. The effective tax rate of the Company differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the tax structure of the Company, the relative weighting of the noncontrolling interest, and lower income from operations over the current relevant period, as well as the aforementioned items required to be reported discretely in the interim period. The Company s effective tax rate was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of million and an income tax expense of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes a stock-based compensation adjustments net tax shortfall of million related to restricted stock awards vesting, which is required to be recorded discretely in the interim period in which it occurs. In addition, the effective tax rate includes a net tax impact of million related to the disposition of BCS, which is required to be recorded discretely in the interim period in which it occurs due to it being a significant, infrequently occurring item disclosed separately in the quarterly financial statements. The Company recognized adjustments of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, of deferred tax assets related to the income tax expense and benefit, respectively, derived from the net operating income generated over the same period. The Company recognized adjustments of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, of deferred tax assets related to the income tax benefit and expense, respectively, derived from the net operating income generated over the same period. Deferred tax assets, net of million as of September 30, 2024 , relates primarily to the basis difference in the Company s investment in Hawk Parent. The basis difference arose primarily as a result of the subsequent exchanges of Post-Merger Repay Units by the Company. In addition, as a result of the merger with BillingTree on June 15, 2021, an estimated opening deferred tax liability net of million, as adjusted, was recorded. The merger was recognized as a Qualified Stock Purchase within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code (the Code Section 338(d)(3). As such, no step up in the tax asset basis was permitted creating an estimated net deferred tax liability related to the tax asset basis difference in the investment in Hawk Parent on the opening balance sheet date. Furthermore, as part of the 2029 Notes issuance on July 8, 2024, the Company incurred million of costs for privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions to cover the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the 2029 Notes. The capped call had an initial strike price of per share and a cap price of per share, which is subject to certain adjustments. For Tax purposes, this is considered a tax-efficient capped call (i.e., the capped call is integrated with the 2029 Notes in accordance with Section 1.1275-6 of the Code). As such, the total million incurred to acquire the capped call is treated as original issue discount OID on synthetic debt and eligible for a deduction as interest expense over the life of the instrument, subject to certain limitations under 163(j). As a result of the capped call being booked as equity for GAAP purposes instead of OID on synthetic debt, the Company is required to set up a tax effected deferred tax asset of million for the equivalent amount of the capped call. This temporary difference created as a result of the OID Interest Expense deduction is expected to be realized over the term of the instrument. The Company did not recognize any adjustment to the deferred tax asset DTA and offsetting deferred tax liability DTL recorded as a result of the ceiling rule limitation arising under Code Sec. 704(c) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , to account for the portion of the Company s outside basis in the partnership interest that it will not recover through tax deductions. As the ceiling rule causes taxable income allocations to be in excess of

 valuation allowance was recognized. uncertain tax positions existed as of September 30, 2024. Tax Receivable Agreement Liability Pursuant to the Company s election under Section 754 of the Code, the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of Hawk Parent when Post-Merger Repay Units are redeemed or exchanged for Class A common stock of Repay Holdings Corporation. The Company intends to treat any redemptions and exchanges of Post-Merger Repay Units as direct purchases for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that the Company would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. On July 11, 2019, the Company entered into a TRA that provides for the payment by the Company of of the amount of any tax benefits realized, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of Hawk Parent resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of Post-Merger Repay Units and from its acquisition of the equity of the selling Hawk Parent members, (ii) tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the TRA, and (iii) deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to the TRA (the TRA Payments ). The TRA Payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in Hawk Parent or the Company. The rights of each party under the TRA other than the Company are assignable. The timing and amount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the timing and amount of taxable income generated by the Company each year, as well as the tax rate then applicable, among other factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a liability of million related to its projected obligations under the TRA, which is captioned as tax receivable agreement liability in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The increase of million in the TRA liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily a result of the decrease in the Early Termination Rate and accretion, partially offset by a decrease in the tax rate and a payment of the current portion of the TRA liability, as reported at December 31, 2023, over the same period.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 For purposes of this section, "Repay", the Company", "we", or "our" refer to Repay Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Certain figures have been rounded for ease of presentation and may not sum due to rounding. 
 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Statements under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 Overview 
 We provide integrated payment processing solutions to industry-oriented markets in which clients have specific transaction processing needs. We refer to these markets as vertical markets or verticals. Our proprietary, integrated payment technology platform reduces the complexity of the electronic payments process for businesses, while enhancing their consumers overall experience. We are a payments innovator, differentiated by our proprietary, integrated payment technology platform and our ability to reduce the complexity of the electronic payments for businesses. We intend to continue to strategically target verticals where we believe our ability to tailor payment solutions to our client needs, our deep knowledge of our vertical markets and the embedded nature of our integrated payment solutions will drive strong growth by attracting new clients and fostering long-term client relationships. 
 We report our financial results based on two reportable segments. 
 Consumer Payments Our Consumer Payments segment provides payment processing solutions (including debit and credit card processing, ACH processing and other electronic payment acceptance solutions, as well as our loan disbursement product) that enable our clients to collect payments from and disburse funds to consumers and includes our RCS offering. RCS is our proprietary clearing and settlement platform through which we market customizable payment processing programs to other ISOs and payment facilitators. The strategic vertical markets served by our Consumer Payments segment primarily include personal loans, automotive loans, receivables management, credit unions, mortgage servicing, consumer healthcare and diversified retail. 
 Business Payments Our Business Payments segment provides payment processing solutions (including accounts payable automation, debit and credit card processing, virtual credit card processing, ACH processing and other electronic payment acceptance solutions) that enable our clients to collect payments from or send payments to other businesses. The strategic vertical markets served within our Business Payments segment primarily include retail automotive, education, field services, governments and municipalities, healthcare, media, HOA management and hospitality. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 We have been monitoring the current economic environment in the U.S. and globally characterized by heightened inflation (including changes in wages), rising interest rates, supply chain issues, slower growth and recent banking system volatility. Such macroeconomic conditions may continue to evolve in ways that are difficult to fully anticipate and may also include increased levels of unemployment and/or a recession. Some or all of these market factors have and could continue to adversely affect our payment volumes from the consumer loan market, the receivables management industry and consumer and commercial spending. The effect of these events on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Finally, the impact of all of these various events on our results in the first nine months of 2024 may not be necessarily indicative of their impact on our results for the remainder of 2024. 
 22 

Business Combination 
 The Company was formed upon closing of the merger of Hawk Parent with a subsidiary of Thunder Bridge, a special purpose acquisition company, on July 11, 2019. On the closing of the Business Combination, Thunder Bridge changed its name to Repay Holdings Corporation. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Business 
 Key factors that we believe impact our business, results of operations and financial condition include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the dollar amount volume and the number of transactions that are processed by the clients that we currently serve; 

our ability to attract new clients and onboard them as active processing clients; 

our ability to (i) successfully integrate recent acquisitions and (ii) complete future acquisitions; 

our ability to offer new and competitive payment technology solutions to our clients; and 

general economic conditions and consumer finance trends. 

Key Components of Our Revenues and Expenses 
 Revenues 
 Revenue. As our clients process increased volumes of payments, our revenues increase as a result of the fees we charge for processing these payments. Most of our revenues are derived from volume-based payment processing fees discount fees and other related fixed per transaction fees. Discount fees represent a percentage of the dollar amount of each credit or debit transaction processed and include fees relating to processing and services that we provide. The transaction price for such processing services is determined, based on the judgment of management, considering factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, client segment pricing strategies, the product life cycle and the observable price of the service charged to similarly situated clients. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our chargeback rate was less than 1 of our card payment volume. 
 Expenses 
 Costs of services . Costs of services primarily include commissions to our software integration partners and other third-party processing costs, such as front and back-end processing costs and sponsor bank fees. 
 Selling, general and administrative . Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, share-based compensation and other employment costs, professional service fees, rent and utilities, and other operating costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation expense consists of depreciation on our investments in property, equipment and computer hardware. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense for software development costs and purchased software is recognized on the straight-line method over a three-year estimated useful life, between eight to ten years estimated useful life for client relationships and channel relationships, and between two to five years estimated useful life for non-compete agreements. 
 Interest income (expense), net. Interest income consists of interest received on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists of interest paid in respect of our indebtedness under the convertible senior notes. 
 Change in fair value of tax receivable liability . This amount represents the change in fair value of the tax receivable agreement liability. The TRA liability is carried at fair value; so, any change to the valuation of this liability is recognized through this line in other expense. The change in fair value can result from the redemption or exchange of Post-Merger Repay Units for Class A common stock of Repay Holdings Corporation, through accretion of the discounted fair value of the expected future cash payments, or changes to the discount rate, or Early Termination Rate, used to determine the fair value of the liability.

 Depreciation and amortization expenses were 25.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 26.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.0 million or 3.7 . This decrease was driven by a decrease in amortization of capitalized software.

Interest (Expense) Income, net 
 Interest (expense) income, net was 1.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and included 2.9) million of interest expense and 1.6 million of interest income. Interest (expense) income, net was 0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and included 0.9) million of interest expense and 0.8 million of interest income. Interest expense increased by 2.0 million compared to the prior year period, due to a higher outstanding principal balance under the convertible senior notes. Interest income increased by 0.8 million compared to the prior year period, due to higher average interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalents. 
 Gain on debt extinguishment 
 We incurred a gain of 13.1 million on extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to the repurchase of 220.0 million of 2026 Notes principal, net of a write-off of debt issuance costs relating to the repurchased principal. 
 Change in Fair Value of Tax Receivable Liability 
 We incurred a loss, related to accretion expense and fair value adjustment of the tax receivable liability of 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 3.2 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.2 million. This increase was due to higher fair value adjustments related to the tax receivable liability, primarily as a result of accretion and changes to the discount rate, or Early Termination Rate, used to determine the fair value of the liability. 
 Income Tax Benefit and Expense 
 The income tax expense was 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was a result of the operating loss incurred by us, primarily driven by the change in fair value of the tax receivable liability, stock-based compensation deductions and the amortization of assets acquired in the Business Combination and prior acquisitions, offset by stock-based compensation expense net tax shortfall and impact related to cancellation of debt income and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes, which are required to be recorded discretely in the interim period in which they occur. The income tax benefit was 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a result of the operating loss incurred by us, primarily driven by the change in fair value of the tax receivable liability, stock-based compensation deductions and the amortization of assets acquired in the Business Combination and prior acquisitions, offset by stock-based compensation expense net tax shortfall and the impact of the BCS disposition which are both required to be reported discretely in the interim period in which they occur.

 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were 79.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 79.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.2 million or 0.2 . This increase was driven by additional amortization related to newly capitalized software.

 Gain on debt extinguishment 
 We incurred a gain of 13.1 million on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the repurchase of 220.0 million of 2026 Notes principal, net of a write-off of debt issuance costs relating to the repurchased principal. 
 Change in Fair Value of Tax Receivable Liability 
 We incurred a loss, related to accretion expense and fair value adjustment of the tax receivable liability of 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 3.7 million net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 9.0 million.

 Income Tax Benefit and Expense 
 The income tax benefit was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The income tax expense was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a result of the operating loss incurred by us, primarily driven by the change in fair value of the tax receivable liability, stock-based compensation deductions and the amortization of assets acquired in the Business Combination and prior acquisitions, offset by stock-based compensation expense net tax shortfall and the impact of the BCS disposition which are both required to be reported discretely in the interim period in which they occur.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This report includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to evaluate our operating business, measure our performance and make strategic decisions. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income prior to interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to add back certain charges deemed to not be part of normal operating expenses, non-cash charges and/or non-recurring charges, such as gain on extinguishment of debt, loss on business disposition, non-cash impairment loss, non-cash change in fair value of assets and liabilities, share-based compensation charges, transaction expenses, restructuring and other strategic initiative costs and other non-recurring charges. 
 Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income prior to amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, as adjusted to add back certain charges deemed to not be part of normal operating expenses, non-cash charges and/or non-recurring charges, such as gain on extinguishment of debt, loss on business disposition, non-cash impairment loss, non-cash change in fair value of assets and liabilities, share-based compensation expense, transaction expenses, restructuring and other strategic initiative costs, other non-recurring charges, non-cash interest expense and net of tax effect associated with these adjustments. Adjusted Net Income is adjusted to exclude amortization of all acquisition-related intangibles as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible amortization supplements GAAP financial measures because it allows for greater comparability of operating performance. Although we exclude amortization from acquisition-related intangibles from our non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangibles were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. 
 Adjusted Net Income per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding (on an as-converted basis assuming conversion of the outstanding Post-Merger Repay Units) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (excluding shares subject to forfeiture). 
 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as management. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating profit or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Using these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze our business has material limitations because the calculations are based on the subjective determination of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that investors may find significant. In addition, although other companies in our industry may report measures titled Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per share or similar measures, such non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from how we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures, which reduces their overall usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following tables set forth a reconciliation of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

(1) Adjusted Net Income is adjusted to exclude amortization of all acquisition-related intangibles as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions (see corresponding adjustments in the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income presented above). Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible amortization supplements GAAP financial measures because it allows for greater comparability of operating performance. Although we exclude amortization from acquisition-related intangibles from our non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangibles were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangibles that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangibles have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangibles. 

(k) Represents amortization of non-cash deferred debt issuance costs. 

(l) Represents pro forma income tax adjustment effect associated with items adjusted above. 

(m) Represents the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding (on an as-converted basis assuming conversion of outstanding Post-Merger Repay Units) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These numbers do not include any shares issuable upon conversion of our 2026 Notes.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 35.1 million and 31.9 million, respectively, representing a 10.2 year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 104.3 million and 93.3 million, representing a 11.8 year-over-year increase. 
 Adjusted Net Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.2 million and 19.9 million, respectively, representing a 6.8 year-over-year increase. Adjusted Net Income for the nine months ended 
 34 

September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 65.4 million and 58.6 million, respectively, representing a 11.6 year-over-year increase. 
 Net income (loss) attributable to the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.2 million and 6.2) million, respectively, representing a 152.6 year-over-year improvement in our profitability. Net loss attributable to the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 6.0 million and 37.2 million, respectively, representing a 83.8 year-over-year improvement in our profitability. 
 The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income and improvement in net loss attributable to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the organic growth of our business from newly signed clients, the growth of existing clients, political media spending associated with the 2024 election cycle in our media payments business and cost savings initiatives that reduced both cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. 
 Seasonality 
 We have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer spending and political media spending patterns. Revenues during the first quarter of the calendar year tend to increase in comparison to the remaining three quarters of the calendar year. This increase is due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and the increases in repayment activity levels that follow. Operating expenses show less seasonal fluctuation, with the result that net income is subject to the similar seasonal factors as our revenues. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically financed our operations and working capital through net cash from operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 168.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity of 250.0 million under the Amended Credit Agreement. This balance does not include restricted cash, which reflects cash accounts holding reserves for potential losses and client settlement funds of 46.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Our primary cash needs are to fund working capital requirements, invest in technology development, fund acquisitions and related contingent consideration, make scheduled principal payments and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and pay tax distributions to members of Hawk Parent. We expect that our cash flow from operations, current cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures and to service our debt obligations for the next twelve months and the following five years. 
 We are a holding company with no operations and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund all of our consolidated operations, including future dividend payments, if any. We depend on the payment of distributions by our current subsidiaries, including Hawk Parent, which distributions may be restricted by law or contractual agreements, including agreements governing their indebtedness. For a discussion of those considerations and restrictions, refer to Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 On May 16, 2022, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to 50 million of our outstanding Class A common stock (the Share Repurchase Program ). The Share Repurchase Program has no expiration date but may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 158,496 shares for a total of approximately 1.3 million under the Share Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, we have 36.2 million remaining capacity under the Share Repurchase Program. In addition, in July 2024 we used approximately 40.0 million of proceeds from the offering of 2029 Notes to repurchase approximately 3.9 million shares of Class A common stock.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 115.8 million and 68.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which reflects net income as adjusted for non-cash operating items including depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, and changes in working capital accounts. 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 34.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the capitalization of software development activities. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to cash received from the disposition of BCS, partially offset by the capitalization of software development activities. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the repayments of the 2026 Notes, shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program and purchase of capped calls related to issuance of the 2029 Notes, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 23.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the repayment of the outstanding revolving credit facility balance, payments for tax withholding related to shares vesting under Incentive Plan and ESPP and the CPS earnout payment. 
 Indebtedness 
 Amended Credit Agreement 
 On December 29, 2021, we increased our then existing senior secured credit facilities by 60.0 million to provide for a 185.0 million revolving credit facility pursuant to an amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement. On February 9, 2023, we further amended the Amended Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR with term SOFR as the interest rate benchmark. 
 On February 28, 2023, we repaid in full the entire amount of 20.0 million of the outstanding revolving credit facility. The undrawn capacity of the existing revolving credit facility under the Amended Credit Agreement became 185.0 million after the repayment. 
 Second Amended Credit Agreement 
 On July 10, 2024, we entered into the Second Amended Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions, as lenders, and Truist Bank, as administrative agent. The Second Amended Credit Agreement amends and restates the Amended Credit Agreement, dated as of February 3, 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement consisted of a senior secured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of 185.0 million. The Second Amended Credit Agreement establishes a 250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. This facility matures on the earlier of (a) July 10, 2029, (b) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes (subject to certain exceptions for adequate 
 36 

liquidity) and (c) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2029 Notes (subject to certain exceptions for adequate liquidity). The maturity date may be extended, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Second Amended Credit Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility of 185.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0 million drawn against the revolving credit facility. We paid 0.2 million and 0.4 million in fees related to unused commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We paid 0.1 million and 0.4 million in fees related to unused commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Convertible Senior Notes 
 On January 19, 2021, we issued 440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of such 2026 Notes were sold in the 2026 Notes offering in connection with the full exercise of the initial purchasers option to purchase such additional 2026 Notes pursuant to the purchase agreement. Upon conversion, we may choose to pay or deliver cash, shares of our Class A Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A Common Stock. The 2026 Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed. On July 8, 2024, we used approximately 200.0 million of proceeds from the offering of 2029 Notes and approximately 5.1 million of cash on hand to repurchase 220.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes in connection with the 2029 Notes offering. 
 On July 8, 2024, we issued 287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875 Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 27.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes were sold in connection with the full exercise of the initial purchasers option to purchase such additional 2029 Notes offering pursuant to the purchase agreement. We will settle conversions of the 2029 Notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be converted and cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes being converted. The 2029 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.875 per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025. The 2029 Notes will mature on July 15, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had convertible senior notes outstanding of 496.2 million, net of deferred issuance costs, under the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes. We were in compliance with the related restrictive financial covenants. Additionally, we currently expect that we will remain in compliance with the restrictive financial covenants under the 2026 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the Second Amended Credit Agreement, prospectively. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 Upon the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into the TRA with holders of Post-Merger Repay Units. As a result of the TRA, we established a liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Such liability, which will increase upon the redemptions or exchanges of Post-Merger Repay Units for our Class A common stock, generally represents 100 of the estimated future tax benefit, if any, relating to the increase in tax basis that will result from redemptions or exchanges of the Post-Merger Repay Units for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and certain other tax attributes of the Company and tax benefits of entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. 
 Under the terms of the TRA, we may elect to terminate the TRA early but will be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future cash tax savings. As a result, the associated liability reported on our condensed consolidated financial statements may be increased. We expect that the payment obligations required under the TRA will be substantial. The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges by the holders of Post-Merger Repay Units, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the redemption or exchange, whether such redemptions or exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, the tax rate then applicable and the portion of our payments under the TRA constituting imputed interest. We expect to fund the payment of the amounts due under the TRA out of the cash savings that we actually realize in respect of the 
 37 

attributes to which TRA relates. However, the payments required to be made could be in excess of the actual tax benefits that we realize and there can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the TRA. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a complete discussion of critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates. 
 For information related to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements, see Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Effects of Inflation 
 While inflation may impact our revenues and cost of services, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including U.S. fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. Interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt, which bears interest at variable rates. Our debt has floating interest rates. We are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates for its floating rate debt. Our floating rate debt requires payments based on variable interest rates such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, eurocurrency rate, and SOFR. Therefore, increases in interest rates may reduce our net income or loss by increasing the cost of debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had convertible senior notes of 496.2 million, net of deferred issuance costs outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, we had convertible senior notes of 434.2 million, net of deferred issuance costs, outstanding. The borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Agreement accrue interest at either base rate, described above under Liquidity and Capital Resources Indebtedness , plus a margin of 0.75 to 1.75 or at an adjusted SOFR rate plus a margin of 1.75 to 2.75 under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, in each case depending on the total net leverage ratio, as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement. 
 We may incur additional borrowings from time to time for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Invoices for our services are denominated in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars. We do not expect our future operating results to be significantly affected by foreign currency transaction risk. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 38 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INF ORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGA L PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. Although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of lawsuits, investigations and claims asserted against us, we do not believe any currently pending legal proceeding to which we are a party will have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 
 
 ITE M 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than as set forth below. 
 Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, react to changes in the economy or our industry and to raise additional capital to fund operations. 
 On July 10, 2024, we increased our existing senior secured credit facilities to a 250.0 million revolving credit facility pursuant to an amendment to the revolving credit agreement with Truist Bank and certain other lenders. On January 19, 2021, we issued 440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. On July 8, 2024, we repurchased 220.0 million of the 2026 Notes. Additionally, on July 8, 2024, we issued 287.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes. Our ability to service our obligations under our indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes, the 2029 Notes and any indebtedness we may incur under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate the necessary cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. 
 Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and such level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders. 
 We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. 
 We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2026 Notes or the 2029 Notes, or to repurchase the 2026 Notes or the 2029 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain, limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes. 
 Holders of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes (together Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100 of their principal amount, plus 
 39 

accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, unless we elect to cause to be delivered solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2026 Notes being converted. In addition, upon conversion of the 2029 Notes, we will be required to make cash payments up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes being converted and in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation, we may elect to make cash payments or deliver shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination, to settle such conversion. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes surrendered therefor or to pay cash with respect to the Notes being converted. 
 In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the 2026 Notes and the indenture governing the 2029 Notes (together the indentures or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indentures, would constitute a default under the indentures. A default under the indentures, or the fundamental change itself, could also lead to a default under our Second Amended Credit Agreement and other agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase, make interest payments on or make cash payments upon conversion of the Notes. 
 The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2026 Notes will be entitled to convert their 2026 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2026 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2026 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. 
 In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2029 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2029 Notes will be entitled to convert their 2026 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle any converted principal amount of such notes through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. 
 Provisions in the indentures could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of the Company 
 Certain provisions of the Notes and the indentures could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then we will be required to make an offer to the holders of the Notes to repurchase for cash all or part of their outstanding Notes. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to increase the conversion rate temporarily. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that you may view as favorable. 
 Future issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such issuances or sales may occur, could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline. 
 Hawk Parent has outstanding an aggregate of 5,728,480 Post-Merger Repay Units as of September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Repay Unitholders have the right to elect to exchange such Post-Merger Repay Units into shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement. However, Hawk Parent may elect to settle such exchange in cash in lieu of delivering shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement. 
 In addition, we have reserved a total of 22,226,728 shares of Class A common stock for issuance under our Incentive Plan. To the extent such shares have vested or vest in the future (and settle into shares, in the case of restricted 
 40 

stock units), they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. 
 If these stockholders exercise their sale or exchange rights and sell shares or are perceived by the market as intending to sell shares, the market price of our shares of Class A common stock could drop significantly. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through offerings of our shares of Class A common stock or other securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 
 We also have outstanding 220.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes and 287.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes which are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock in certain circumstances. Investors will incur further dilution upon the conversion of any of our Notes if we elect to deliver shares of Class A common stock upon such conversion. In the future, we may also issue additional securities in connection with investments, acquisitions or capital raising activities, which could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and may result in additional dilution to investors or adversely impact the price of our Class A common stock.
