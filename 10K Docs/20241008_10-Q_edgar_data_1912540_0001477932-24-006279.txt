Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, significant uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed, or implied, by those forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, intends, potential, proposed, or continue or the negative of those terms. These statements are only predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the exceptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2023, we had a cash balance and total assets of 1,529 compared to cash and total assets of 256 as at December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and total assets was due to increase in shareholder loan from the President and Director. As at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022 we had total liabilities of 12,457 and 13,957 respectively. The decrease in liabilities was due to the repayment of 1,600 towards related party dues owed to our President and Director. Our working capital deficit was 10,928 as at June 30, 2023 compared to 13,701 as at December 31, 2022. The decrease in the working capital deficit was due to the increase in cash balance as at June 30, 2023. Results of Operations For three month ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred 34 of operating expenditures comprised of general and administrative expenses of 34. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we incurred 4,754 of operating expenditures comprised of general and administrative expenses of 65 and professional fees of 4,689. For six month ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred 2,927 of operating expenditures comprised of general and administrative expenses of 102 and professional fees of 2,825. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we incurred 10,193 of operating expenditures comprised of electronic components and fabric 137 general and administrative expenses 663 and professional fees of 9,393. Cash Flows During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we used 2,927 of cash for operating activities including prototype development, professional fees and general and administrative expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we used 9,524. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company received proceeds of 100 from our Director towards the operating expenses and paid 1,600 to our President and Director towards repayment of related party dues. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company received proceeds of 11,986 from our Director of the company towards operating expenses. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we received 5,700 in share application money. Trends There is no assurance that we will be able to generate cash flows from our operations. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raises substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 12 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders. Inflation The effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared using the accrual method of accounting, which conforms to US GAAP. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. The financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 included herein, which have not been audited pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for a full year. Certain information, accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Going Concern The Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has generated no revenues to date, has a working capital deficit of 10,928 and has an accumulated deficit of 33,207. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company s future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We are required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We review new accounting standards as issued. Although some of these accounting standards issued or effective after the end of our previous fiscal year may be applicable to us, we have not identified any standards that we believe merit further discussion. We believe that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on our financial position, future operations or cash flows. 13 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk None Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, both the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, were effective as of June 30, 2023. Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934) that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Michael Gillespie Associates, PLLC, our independent auditors, were not required and have not performed an assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting for effectiveness. 14 Table of Contents Part II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors described in our Registration Statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective on May 13, 2022.
