 For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in Astronics Corporation s 2023 annual report on Form 10-K. 
 On February 13, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its semiconductor test business within the Test Systems segment. The transaction included elements of contingent earnouts. In March 2023, the Company agreed with the final earnout calculation for the calendar 2022 earnout for million. The Company recorded the gain and received the payment in the first quarter of 2023. 
 In October 2024, a customer reported within the Aerospace segment declared bankruptcy. As a result, the Company recorded a full reserve of million for outstanding receivables, a reserve of million for inventory and million for impairment of fixed assets. The reserves are non-cash in the current quarter and year to date, as the associated assets existed prior to 2024. In the third quarter of 2023, a customer reported within the Aerospace segment filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. As a result, the Company recorded a full reserve of million for outstanding accounts receivable and million for inventory in the prior year periods.

 As previously discussed, the Company recorded a full reserve of million in the third quarter of 2024 for outstanding receivables associated with a customer bankruptcy within the Aerospace segment. Additionally, the Company recorded a full reserve in the third quarter of 2023 of million for outstanding accounts receivable associated with a customer bankruptcy within the Aerospace segment, which was subsequently written off in the second quarter of 2024. 
 million and million for the three months ended and million and million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. These costs are included in cost of products sold. 
 As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company concluded that no indicators of impairment relating to intangible assets or goodwill existed and an interim test was not performed in the nine-month periods then ended.

 million of outstanding performance obligations, which we refer to as total backlog. In conjunction with the customer bankruptcy discussed in Note 1, we have removed all outstanding backlog in the third quarter of 2024, approximately million, related to such customer. We expect to recognize approximately million of our outstanding performance obligations as revenue over the next and the balance thereafter. 
 The Company's contract assets and contract liabilities consist primarily of costs and profits in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost and profits, respectively. 
 Ending Balance, September 28, 2024 
 
 The increase in contract assets reflects the net impact of new revenue recognized in excess of billings exceeding billing of previously unbilled revenue during the period, partially offset by a million revision of estimated costs to complete certain long-term mass transit Test contracts which was recorded in the second quarter of 2024. The revision resulted in reduced revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 due to lower estimates of the percentage of work completed on the programs. The decrease in contract liabilities reflects the net impact of revenue recognized in excess of new customer advances or deferred revenues recorded. 
 We recognized million and million during the three months ended and million and million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, in revenues that were included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period. 
 The Company recognizes an asset for certain, material costs to fulfill a contract if it is determined that the costs relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract that can be specifically identified, generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future, and are expected to be recovered. Such costs are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods to which the asset relates. Start-up costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized fulfillment costs are included in Work in Progress within Inventories in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. Should future orders not materialize or it is determined the costs are no longer probable of

 The Company also entered into a million Term Loan Facility on July 11, 2024. The Term Loan Facility is secured primarily by the Company s intellectual property and equity interests of the Company s subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is July 11, 2027.

The Company paid a commitment fee to the lenders under the Term Loan Facility in the amount of of the total aggregate commitment. The Company is required to repay the principal amount of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility in quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to million. The principal amount of the Term Loan Facility amortizes at a rate of (or approximately million) per year. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a call premium of if called prior to January 12, 2026, and thereafter until the maturity date on July 11, 2027. The Company has the option to prepay the outstanding amounts under the Term Loan Facility up to million without penalty. 
 Total payments of million are payable over the next twelve months, including the annual amortization of the Term Loan Facility, and as such, have been classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024. The interest rate on current maturities of long-debt was at September 28, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The remaining balance of million under the Term Loan Facility as of September 28, 2024, is recorded as long-term in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet. 
 The Company repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness under the original term loan facility dated as of January 19, 2023. The payoff amount of approximately million consisted of a repayment of the principal amount of approximately million, plus accrued but unpaid interest, fees and expenses, including a call premium of (or approximately million) which satisfied all of the Company s indebtedness obligations thereunder. The Company funded the repayment of its obligations under the previous agreement with borrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. 
 The Company incurred million in incremental debt issuance costs during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, allocated between the original and revised ABL Revolving Credit Facilities and the original and revised Term Loan Facilities. All costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective agreement. Unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the ABL Revolving Credit Facility million as of September 28, 2024) are recorded within Other Assets and those associated with the Term Loan Facility million as of September 28, 2024) are recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the debt on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet. 
 In the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of the debt of approximately million below Income from Operations, which was comprised of the million prepayment fee on the previous term loan and a write-off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs.

 9)) and for the three months ended and ) and ) for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Beginning with the 2022 tax year, certain research and development costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over sixty months for income tax purposes. The tax rate in the 2024 period was impacted by a valuation allowance applied against the deferred tax asset associated with the research and development costs that are expected to be capitalized and was partially offset by the removal of valuation allowances related to net operating losses and certain timing differences that are expected to reverse during 2024. In addition, the tax rate in the 2024 period was also impacted by state income taxes and the federal research and development credit expected for 2024. 
 The Company records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if and to the extent it is more likely than not that the Company will not recover the deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company weighs all relevant positive and negative evidence and considers among other factors, historical financial performance, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, and tax planning strategies. Losses in recent periods and cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current year, combined with the significant uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, are collectively considered significant negative evidence under ASC 740 when assessing whether an entity can use projected income as a basis for concluding that deferred tax assets are realizable on a more-likely than not basis. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company determined that it could not include future projected earnings in the analysis due to its recent history of losses and therefore had insufficient objective positive evidence that the Company will generate sufficient future taxable income to overcome the

The Company currently believes it is unlikely that the damages in the German indirect proceedings and related interest will be paid within the next twelve months.

 million, inclusive of interest, based on information available at the time. This amount was subject to change as additional data was received and evaluated, and as additional information regarding the nature of its claim was put forward by Lufthansa in advance of the damages trial. During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, both the Company and Lufthansa submitted to the UK High Court of Justice calculations of the estimated damages derived from the reports of the parties respective financial experts. The Company s experts have calculated a range of loss of million to million (inclusive of interest), while Lufthansa has calculated a range of loss as up to approximately million, excluding interest. 
 The damages trial judgment is expected to be issued in late 2024 or early 2025. While the Company believes they have valid defenses such that the judgment should be at the low end of the range of exposure noted above, the outcome and the amount of any damages that come due and owing cannot be predicted. As of September 28, 2024, we have recognized a liability of million associated with this claim, which represents the low end of the range of exposure described above. Additional interest will continue to accrue on damages that come due and owing until the final payment to Lufthansa. 
 The Company is performing scenario planning to accommodate the range of potential outcomes. It is expected that the UK High Court of Justice will grant permission to appeal, though this is not assured under UK law. If an appeal is allowed, it is unclear whether payment of any imposed judgment would be due shortly after the ruling or deferred, in whole or in part, until the appeal is heard and adjudicated. 
 The liability related to this matter is classified within Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2024. The liability related to this matter was classified within Other Liabilities (non-current) in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. 
 A liability for reimbursement of Lufthansa s legal expenses associated with the UK matter was approximately million and million on September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months and, as such, is classified in Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company expects additional amounts to be payable associated with Lufthansa s legal fees incurred related to the damages proceedings, but is unable to estimate a range of exposure and as such has not recorded any additional liabilities at this time. 
 With respect to the proceeding in France, as previously disclosed, on December 4, 2020, the French Court held the French patent invalid for all asserted claims. There can consequently be no finding of infringement on first instance. Lufthansa has appealed this judgment. The appeal hearing took place on December 8, 2022, and on February 24, 2023, the Court upheld the first instance judgment in favor of AES. Lufthansa lodged an appeal before the French Supreme Court; the French Supreme Court will review the Court of Appeal of Paris reasoning around the nullification of one of the claims of the patent. AES filed briefs with the French Supreme Court on January 22, 2024 and on September 11, 2024 in response to Lufthansa s appeal. The closure of the written phase of the procedure is scheduled for December 3, 2024 and a decision from this Court is expected in late December 2024 or January 2025. As loss exposure is not probable and estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to the French matter as of September 28, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 There were no other significant developments in any of these matters during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Other 
 On March 23, 2020, Teradyne, Inc. filed a complaint against the Company and its subsidiary, Astronics Test Systems ATS (together, the Defendants in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging patent and copyright infringement, and certain other related claims. The Defendants moved to dismiss certain claims from the case. On November 6, 2020, the Court dismissed the Company from the case, and also dismissed a number of claims, though the patent and copyright infringement claims remained. The case proceeded to discovery. In addition, on December 21, 2020, ATS filed a petition for inter partes review IPR with the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB ), seeking to invalidate the subject patent, and on July 21, 2021, the PTAB instituted IPR. The PTAB issued its decision on July 20, 2022, in which it invalidated all of Teradyne s patent claims. Teradyne did not appeal the decision. On June 5, 2023, the parties attended a court-ordered mediation but did not reach a settlement. After the mediation, Teradyne agreed to drop its remaining state law claims in exchange for ATS dropping one of its defenses, leaving only its copyright claim. On December 7, 2023, the District Court granted ATS s motion for summary judgment on its affirmative defense of fair use. The Court subsequently entered final judgment in favor of ATS on December 14, 2023. Teradyne filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on January 12, 2024. Teradyne s opening brief on its appeal was filed on April 9, 2024. ATS s answering brief was filed on June 10, 2024. Teradyne s reply brief was filed on August 7, 2024. Oral argument on the appeal has not yet been scheduled.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 (The following should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.) 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Astronics Corporation, through its subsidiaries, is a leading supplier of advanced technologies and products to the global aerospace and defense industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation and distribution systems, seat motion solutions, lighting and safety systems, avionics products, aircraft structures, systems certification, and automated test systems. 
 Our Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and safety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and seat motion systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems certification, and other products. Our primary Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers OEM that build aircraft for the commercial transport, military, and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEMs, aircraft operators such as airlines, suppliers to the aircraft operators, and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense USDOD ). Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures, and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace and defense and mass transit industries as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics products are sold to a global customer base including OEMs and prime government contractors for both electronics and military products. 
 Our strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities, either internally or through acquisition, and using those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to our targeted markets where our technology can be beneficial. 
 Important factors affecting our growth and profitability are the rate at which new aircraft are produced, government funding and timing of awards of military programs, our ability to have our products designed into new aircraft, and the rates at which aircraft owners, including commercial airlines, refurbish or install upgrades to their aircraft and supply chain and labor market pressures. New aircraft build rates and aircraft owners spending on upgrades and refurbishments is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the global economy. Once one of our products is designed into a new aircraft, the spare parts business associated thereto is also frequently retained by the Company. Future growth and profitability of the Test Systems business is dependent on developing and procuring new and follow-on business. The nature of our Test Systems business is such that it pursues large, often multi-year, projects. There can be significant periods between orders in this business, which may result in large fluctuations in sales and profit levels and backlog from period to period. Test Systems segment customers include the USDOD, prime contractors to the USDOD, mass transit operators and prime contractors to mass transit operators. 
 Each of the markets that we serve presents opportunities that we expect will provide growth for the Company over the long-term. We continue to look for opportunities in all of our markets to capitalize on our core competencies to expand our existing business and to grow through strategic acquisitions. 
 The main challenges that we continue to face include varying levels of supply chain pressures from the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, material availability and cost increases, labor availability and cost, and improving shareholder value through increasing profitability. Increasing profitability is dependent on many things, primarily sales growth, both acquired and organic, and the Company s ability to pass cost increases along to customers and control operating expenses, and identify means of creating improved productivity. Sales are driven by increased build rates for existing aircraft, market acceptance and economic success of new aircraft and our products, continued government funding of defense programs, the Company s ability to obtain production contracts for parts we currently supply or have been selected to design and develop for new aircraft platforms and continually identifying and winning new business for our Test Systems segment. 
 Reduced aircraft build rates driven by regulatory actions impacting OEM production, aircraft groundings, tight credit markets, weak economy, reduced air passenger travel, and an increasing supply of used aircraft on the market would likely result in reduced demand for our products, which will result in lower profits. Reduction of defense spending may result in fewer opportunities for us to compete, which could result in lower profits in the future. Many of our newer development programs are based on new and unproven technology and at the same time we are challenged to develop the technology on a schedule that is consistent with specific programs. Delays in delivery schedules and incremental costs resulting from supply chain and labor rate pressures have in the past resulted, and could in the future also result in, lower profits. We will continue to address these challenges by working to improve operating efficiencies and focusing on executing the growth opportunities currently in front of us.

 Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility each subject us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants pertaining to minimum excess availability requirements and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements. An unexpected decline in our revenues or operating income, including occurring as a result of events beyond our control, could cause us to violate our financial covenants. Our ability to satisfy the financial covenants under our credit agreements is an item that our management team continues to closely monitor. While the Company expects to remain in compliance with the required financial covenants for the duration of the agreements, any unexpected negative impacts to our business, including as a result of declines in aircraft production rates from expectations or production delays resulting from regulatory actions or labor strikes affecting OEMs or subsidiaries of the Company, additional supply chain pressures, the timing of customer orders, and our ability to meet customer delivery schedules, or labor availability and cost pressures, could result in lower revenues and reduced financial profits, and, as a result thereof, our inability to satisfy the financial covenants in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. 
 Challenges affecting the commercial aviation industry or key participants can adversely impact the demand for our products and services, the timing of orders, deliveries and related payments and other factors. We are monitoring the production and other challenges at The Boeing Company, including the recent strike, and we continue to align with them on production expectations and assess potential impacts to our business. The impacts from the strike to our revenues, earnings and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 have not been significant. 
 We are monitoring the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors, including the aviation sector, and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others. Although the conflict has not resulted in a direct material adverse impact on our business to date, the implications of the Russia and Ukraine conflict in the short-term and long-term are difficult to predict at this time. Factors such as increased energy costs, the availability of certain raw materials for aircraft manufacturers, embargoes on flights from Russian airlines, sanctions on Russian companies, and the stability of Ukrainian customers could impact the global economy and aviation sector. 
 On February 13, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its semiconductor test business within the Test Systems segment. The transaction included two elements of contingent earnouts. In March 2023, the Company agreed with the final earnout calculation for the calendar 2022 semiconductor test business earnout for 3.4 million. The Company recorded the gain and received the payment in the first quarter of 2023. 
 In October 2024, a customer reported within the Aerospace segment declared bankruptcy. As a result, the Company recorded a full reserve of 0.8 million for outstanding receivables, a reserve of 0.9 million for inventory and 0.5 million for impairment of fixed assets. The reserves are non-cash in the current quarter and year to date, as the associated assets existed prior to 2024. In the third quarter of 2023, a customer reported within the Aerospace segment filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. As a result, the Company recorded a full reserve of 7.5 million for outstanding accounts receivable and 3.6 million for inventory in the prior year periods.

 CONSOLIDATED THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 
 Consolidated sales were up 40.8 million, or 25.0 . Aerospace sales increased 35.5 million and Test Systems sales increased 5.3 million. 
 Consolidated cost of products sold in the third quarter of 2024 was 161.0 million, compared with 142.3 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume coupled with 2.5 million for resumed incentive programs, a 3.5 million atypical warranty reserve related to a new product launch that requires a field modification and a 3.2 million increase in non-bankruptcy related inventory reserves, offset by a decrease in non-cash reserves associated with customer bankruptcies previously discussed of 2.7 million. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were 34.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 35.1 million in the prior-year period. The current year was affected by increased wages and benefits, including 2.0 million for resumed incentive programs, and an increase of 1.9 million in litigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments in 2024. The prior year was negatively impacted by a 7.5 million reserve for accounts receivable compared to a 1.3 million reserve for accounts receivable and fixed asset impairments in the current quarter associated with customer bankruptcies previously discussed. 
 Third quarter 2024 expenses included a 3.2 million call premium on the previous term loan and the write-off of 3.8 million of associated deferred financing costs. The 7.0 million total has been reflected as Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. 
 Tax expense in the quarter was 6.6 million, primarily due to a valuation allowance applied against the deferred tax asset associated with research and development costs that are required to be capitalized for tax purposes. 
 Consolidated net loss was 11.7 million, or 0.34 per diluted share, compared with net loss of 17.0 million, or 0.51 per diluted share, in the prior year. 
 Bookings were 189.2 million in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.93:1. For the trailing twelve months, bookings totaled 795.5 million and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.02:1. Backlog at the end of the quarter was 611.9 million. 
 CONSOLIDATED YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS 
 Consolidated sales were up 93.0 million, or 18.8 . Aerospace sales increased 82.1 million and Test Systems sales increased 10.9 million. The prior-year period Test Systems sales benefited from the reversal of a 5.8 million deferred revenue liability recorded with a previous acquisition. 
 Consolidated cost of products sold in the 2024 was 468.6 million, compared with 413.1 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to higher volume, coupled with 6.2 million for resumed incentive programs, a 3.5 million warranty reserve previously mentioned and a 3.4 million increase in non-bankruptcy related inventory reserves, offset by a decrease in non-cash reserves associated with customer bankruptcies previously discussed of 2.7 million. 
 SG A expenses were 100.7 million in the 2024 compared with 95.3 million in the prior-year period. The current year was affected by increased wages and benefits, including 5.9 million related for resumed incentive programs, and an increase of 1.9 million in litigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments in 2024. The increase in SG A expenses was offset by a decrease in non-cash reserves associated with customer bankruptcies previously discussed of 6.2 million. 
 The expenses in the current year include the 7.0 million Loss on Extinguishment of Debt described above. 
 In the prior year period, the Company recognized a 3.4 million gain from the final earnout payment for the 2019 sale of its semiconductor test business, as well as 1.8 million within Other Income associated with the reversal of a liability related to an equity investment. 
 Tax expense in the current period was 4.9 million, compared with tax expense of 5.6 million in the prior year. 
 Consolidated net loss was 13.4 million, or 0.38 per diluted share, compared with net loss of 33.4 million, or 1.02 per diluted share, in the prior year.

 AEROSPACE THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 
 Aerospace segment sales increased 35.5 million, or 24.9 , to 177.6 million. The improvement was driven by a 31.6 increase, or 32.1 million, in Commercial Transport sales. Sales to this market were 133.9 million, or 65.8 of consolidated sales in the quarter, compared with 101.7 million, or 62.5 of consolidated sales in the third quarter of 2023. Growth was primarily related to increased demand by airlines for inflight entertainment connectivity IFEC products which are in the Electrical Power Motion and Avionics product groups. 
 Military Aircraft sales increased 5.0 million, or 30.0 , to 21.7 million, driven by progress on the FLRAA program. General Aviation sales increased 1.9 million, or 11.6 , to 18.1 million due to higher VVIP sales. Other sales decreased 3.6 million as the Company is winding down its non-core contract manufacturing arrangements. 
 Aerospace segment operating profit of 14.3 million was up 21.7 million compared with operating loss of 7.5 million in the same period last year. Operating margin was 8.0 reflecting the leverage gained on higher volume and improving production efficiencies. 
 The segment s operating profit in the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by 3.5 million in warranty expense related to the previously-mentioned field modification, 5.1 million in litigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments related to an

Table of Contents 

 ongoing patent dispute, 3.9 million in inventory reserves, and 3.2 million in compensation expense related to the resumption of the Company s incentive programs, and a non-cash reserve associated with a customer bankruptcy of 2.2 million. 
 Aerospace bookings were 173.6 million for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98:1. Backlog for the Aerospace segment was 543.6 million at quarter end and excludes 9.3 million of backlog that was associated with the customer bankruptcy referred to previously. 
 AEROSPACE YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS 
 Aerospace segment sales increased 82.1 million, or 18.8 , to 518.1 million. The improvement was driven by a 24.6 increase, or 75.7 million, in Commercial Transport sales. Sales to this market were 383.7 million, or 65.4 of consolidated sales in 2024, compared with 308.0 million, or 62.3 of consolidated sales in the same period of 2023. Higher airline spending drove increased demand. 
 Military Aircraft sales increased 19.2 million, or 43.3 , to 63.5 million, driven by progress on the FLRAA program as well as higher sales of lighting, safety and avionics products for military aircraft. General Aviation sales decreased 4.0 million, or 6.6 , to 56.6 million due to lower antenna and VVIP sales. Other sales decreased 8.8 million as the Company is winding down its non-core contract manufacturing arrangements. 
 Aerospace segment operating profit of 45.6 million was up 35.3 million compared with operating profit of 10.3 million in the same period last year. Operating margin improvement reflects the leverage gained on higher volume and improving production efficiencies. Operating profit in 2024 was impacted by a 4.2 million increase in warranty expense, which was primarily related to the previously-mentioned field modification, an 8.6 million increase in litigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments related to an ongoing patent dispute, a 3.9 million increase in inventory reserves and 8.5 million in compensation expense related to the resumption of the Company s incentive programs, offset by a decrease in non-cash reserves associated with customer bankruptcies of 8.9 million.

 TEST SYSTEMS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 
 Test Systems segment sales were 26.1 million, up 5.3 million. The improvement was driven by the U.S. Marine Corps Handheld Radio Test Sets HHRTS and the U.S. Army s TS-4549/T programs, which contributed 5.3 million and 1.2 million, respectively, in sales during the quarter. 
 Test Systems segment operating loss was near break-even, compared with operating loss of 1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The improvement was the result of lower litigation-related legal expenses, partially offset by additional compensation expense from the resumption of the Company s incentive programs. Test Systems continues to be negatively affected by mix and under absorption of fixed costs at current volume levels. 
 Additional restructuring initiatives were implemented in the 2024 fourth quarter. In October 2024, the Company offered a voluntary separation program which is currently expected to provide annualized savings of approximately 2 million, beginning in the first quarter of 2025. The Company expects to record severance expense of approximately 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to this initiative.

Table of Contents 

 Bookings for the Test Systems segment in the quarter were 15.6 million. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.60:1 for the quarter. Backlog for the Test Systems segment was 68.2 million at quarter end. 
 TEST SYSTEMS YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS 
 Test Systems segment sales were 68.8 million, up 10.9 million driven primarily by our U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps Radio Test programs. However, sales were negatively impacted by 3.5 million due to a revision of estimated costs to complete certain long-term mass transit Test contracts. The revision resulted in reduced revenue recognized in the period due to lower estimates of the percentage of work completed on the programs. The prior-year period sales benefited from the reversal of a 5.8 million deferred revenue liability recorded with a previous acquisition. 
 Test Systems segment operating loss was 8.4 million, compared to operating loss of 8.5 million in 2023. Test Systems operating loss for the prior-year period benefited from the 5.8 million sales adjustment resulting from the reversal of the deferred revenue liability. The first nine months of 2024 benefited from the margin realized on the HHRTS and TS-4549/T sales and a 6.7 million decrease in litigation-related expenses, however Test Systems operating performance continues to be negatively affected by mix and under absorption of fixed costs due to low volume, the resumption of the Company s incentive programs, and the revision of estimated costs on certain long-term mass transit contracts discussed above, which resulted in a 3.5 million reversal of revenue. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Operating Activities: 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 4.1 million for the first nine months of 2024, as compared with 22.3 million cash used for operating activities during the same period in 2023. Cash flow from operating activities increased compared with the same period of 2023 primarily resulting from the improvement in our operating results, driven by higher sales. 
 Investing Activities: 
 Cash used for investing activities was 5.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2.6 million in cash used for investing activities in the same period of 2023. Investing cash flows in 2023 were positively impacted by the receipt of 3.4 million received in the prior year related to the calendar 2022 earnout. 
 The Company expects capital spending in 2024 to be in the range of 9 million to 11 million. 
 Financing Activities: 
 Cash used for financing activities totaled 3.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, as compared with cash provided by financing activities of 18.8 million during the same period in 2023.

 The Company amended the existing revolving credit facility on July 11, 2024 by entering into the Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ABL Revolving Credit Facility ). The ABL Revolving Credit Facility set the maximum aggregate amount that the Company can borrow pursuant to the revolving credit line at 200 million, with borrowings subject to a borrowing base determined primarily by inventory, accounts receivable, machinery and equipment and real estate. The maturity date of borrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is July 11, 2027. Under the terms of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Company pays interest on the unpaid principal amount of the credit facility at a rate equal to SOFR plus a term SOFR adjustment in the amount of 0.10 per annum (which collectively shall be at least 1.00 plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50 to 3.00 determined based upon the Company s excess availability (as defined in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility). The Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility on undrawn revolving credit commitments in an amount equal to 0.25 or 0.375 based on the Company s average excess availability under the credit facility. On September 28, 2024, there was 126.0 million outstanding on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and there remained 70.9 million available, net of outstanding letters of credit. 
 The Company also entered into a 55 million Term Loan Facility on July 11, 2024. The Term Loan Facility is secured primarily by the Company s intellectual property and equity interests of the Company s subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is July 11, 2027. The Company pays interest under the Term Loan Facility at a rate equal to SOFR plus a term SOFR adjustment in the amount of 0.10 per annum (which collectively shall be at least 1.00 plus an applicable margin ranging from 5.50 to 6.75 determined based upon the Company s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Facility). The Company paid a commitment fee to the lenders under the Term Loan Facility in the amount of 2.0

 of the total aggregate commitment. The Company is required to repay the principal amount of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility in quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to 0.1 million. The principal amount of the Term Loan Facility amortizes at a rate of 1.00 (or approximately 0.6 million) per year. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a call premium of 3.00 if called prior to January 12, 2026, and 0.00 thereafter until the maturity date on July 11, 2027. The Company has the option to prepay the outstanding amounts under the Term Loan Facility up to 12.0 million without penalty. 
 Total payments of 0.6 million are payable over the next twelve months, including the annual amortization of the Term Loan Facility, and as such, have been classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024. The interest rate on current maturities of long-debt was 8.2 at September 28, 2024 and 14.2 at December 31, 2023. The remaining balance of 54.5 million under the Term Loan Facility as of September 28, 2024, is recorded as long-term in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet. 
 The Company repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness under the original term loan facility dated as of January 19, 2023. The payoff amount of approximately 84.5 million consisted of a repayment of the principal amount of approximately 80.3 million, plus accrued but unpaid interest, fees and expenses, including a call premium of 4.00 (or approximately 3.2 million) which satisfied all of the Company s indebtedness obligations thereunder. The Company funded the repayment of its obligations under the previous agreement with borrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. 
 The Company incurred 5.9 million in incremental debt issuance costs during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, allocated between the original and revised ABL Revolving Credit Facilities and the original and revised Term Loan Facilities. All costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective agreement. Unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the ABL Revolving Credit Facility 2.8 million as of September 28, 2024) are recorded within Other Assets and those associated with the Term Loan Facility 2.0 million as of September 28, 2024) are recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the debt on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet. 
 In the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of the debt of approximately 7.0 million below Income from Operations, which was comprised of the 3.2 million prepayment fee on the previous term loan and a write-off of 3.8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs. The Company also had a write-off of deferred financing costs of approximately 0.5 million related to the exiting ABL lender in Interest Expense within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations. 
 Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are borrowers under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility and the assets of such subsidiaries also secure the obligations under the Restated Agreement and the Term Loan Facility. 
 Pursuant to the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility, the Company is subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00. The Company is also required to maintain minimum excess availability of the greater of 10 of the borrowing base under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, or 15.0 million. Under the provisions of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has a cash dominion arrangement with the lead banking institution whereby eligible daily cash receipts are contractually utilized to pay down outstanding borrowings and any cash balances subject to the dominion arrangement collateralize the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Eligible cash balances that have not yet been applied to outstanding debt balances are classified as restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. 
 In the event of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of the Company or any subsidiary, all unpaid principal and other amounts owing under the credit facilities automatically become due and payable. Other events of default, such as failure to make payments as they become due and breach of financial and other covenants, change of control, cross default under other material debt agreements, and a going concern qualification for any reason other than loan maturity date give the agent the option to declare all such amounts immediately due and payable. 
 On June 5, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which allows us to issue shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts and debt securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate offering price of 150 million and on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. On August 8, 2023, the Company initiated an at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program for the sale from time to time of shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share having an aggregate offering price of up to 30 million. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company did not sell any shares of our common stock under the ATM Program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold 834,228 shares of our common stock under the ATM Program. The Company generated 13.9 million in aggregate gross proceeds from sales under 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 the ATM Program at an average sale price of 16.70 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from the ATM Program were 13.6 million after deducting related expenses, including commissions to the Sales Agents and issuance costs. Of this amount, 13.1 million in net cash proceeds were received in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the remainder received in October 2023. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had remaining capacity under the ATM Program to sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price up to approximately 8.2 million. 
 Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was 6.4 million. Net debt was 174.6 million, compared with 161.2 million at the end of 2023. 
 The Company expects its cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash flows to fund operations. However, the Company may also evaluate various actions and alternatives to enhance its profitability and cash generation from operating activities, which could include manufacturing efficiency initiatives, cost-reduction measures, working with vendors and suppliers to reduce lead times and expedite shipment of critical components, and working with customers to expedite receivable collections. The Company may also utilize available capacity under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and comply with financial debt covenants is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results. Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, our ability to obtain financing or access our existing financing, and our operations in the future and could allow our debt holders to demand payment of all outstanding amounts. 
 Lufthansa Technik AG Lufthansa filed actions in Germany, the United Kingdom UK and France. These matters are more fully discussed in Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1, Financial Information of this report, and Risk Factors in Part 2, Item 1a, Other Information of this report. In the matter before the UK High Court of Justice, Lufthansa is seeking damages significantly higher than the amount which has been accrued as a liability by the Company. While we believe we have valid defenses and are vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings, based upon the outcome of the damages trial this may have a material impact on the Company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods, but the extent of the impact, if any, will not be known until the judgment is released. The Company is performing scenario planning to accommodate the range of potential outcomes. 
 
 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 BACKLOG 
 The Company s backlog on September 28, 2024 was 611.9 million compared with 586.6 million on December 31, 2023 and 598.6 million on September 30, 2023. The backlog in each of the periods presented excludes backlog associated with the customer bankruptcy referred to previously. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS 
 Our contractual obligations and commitments have not changed materially from the disclosures in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K except as set forth below. 
 The Company amended its existing ABL Revolving Credit Facility on July 11, 2024 by entering into the Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility increased the maximum aggregate amount that the Company can borrow pursuant to the revolving credit line thereunder to 200 million from 115 million, with borrowings subject to a borrowing base determined primarily by inventory, accounts receivable, machinery and equipment and real estate. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility extended the scheduled maturity date for the credit facility from January 19, 2026 to July 11, 2027. Under the terms of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Company will now pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of the credit facility at a rate equal to SOFR plus a term SOFR adjustment in the amount of 0.10 per annum (which collectively shall be at least 1.00 plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50 to 3.00 determined based upon the Company s excess availability (as defined in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility). The Company will pay a quarterly commitment fee under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility on undrawn revolving credit commitments in an amount equal to 0.25 or 0.375 based on the Company s average excess availability under the credit facility. 
 The Company also entered into a 55 million Term Loan Facility on July 11, 2024. The Revised Term Loan Facility is secured primarily by the Company s intellectual property and equity interests of the Company s subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Revised Term Loan Facility is July 11, 2027. The Company will pay interest under the Revised Term Loan Facility at a rate equal to SOFR plus a term SOFR adjustment in the amount of 0.10 per annum (which collectively shall be at least 1.00 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 plus an applicable margin ranging from 5.50 to 6.75 determined based upon the Company s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Revised Term Loan Facility). The Company will pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revised Term Loan Facility in the amount of 2.0 of the total aggregate commitment. The Company is required to repay the principal amount of the term loans under the Revised Term Loan Facility in quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to 137,500. The principal amount of the Revised Term Loan Facility will amortize at a rate of 1.00 (or approximately 0.6 million) per year. 
 The Company repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of January 19, 2023. The payoff amount of approximately 84.5 million consisted of a repayment of the principal amount of approximately 80.3 million, plus accrued but unpaid interest, fees and expenses, including a call premium of 4.00 (or approximately 3.2 million) which satisfied all of the Company s indebtedness obligations thereunder. The Company funded the repayment of its obligations under the previous agreement with borrowings under the Restated Agreement and the Revised Term Loan Facility. 
 Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding the amended and expanded credit agreements. 
 
 MARKET RISK 
 Risk due to fluctuation in interest rates is a function of the Company s floating rate debt obligations, which total approximately 181.0 million as of September 28, 2024. A change of 1 in interest rates of all variable rate debt would impact annual net loss by approximately 1.8 million, before income taxes. 
 Although the majority of our sales, expenses, and cash flows are transacted in U.S. dollars, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related primarily to the Euro and the Canadian dollar. The Company believes that the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in 2024 has not been significant. 
 The future impacts of the Russia and Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic and the recently resolved Boeing strike and their residual effects, including economic uncertainty, inflationary environment, and disruption within the global supply chain, labor markets, and aerospace industry, on our business remain uncertain. As we cannot anticipate the ultimate duration or scope of the Russia-Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic or the ramifications of the recently resolved Boeing strike, the ultimate financial impact on our results cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this report for the Company s critical accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition. For a complete discussion of the Company s other critical accounting policies, refer to the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Currently, we are involved in legal proceedings relating to an allegation of patent infringement and, based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable. For a discussion of contingencies related to legal proceedings, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 1a. Risk Factors 
 In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 10-K ), which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our risk factors have not changed materially from those risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 10-K except as set forth below. The risks described in this report and in the 2023 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. 
 Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain financial and restrictive covenants that we may be unable to satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the terms of our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain covenants that restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain actions. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility each subject us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants pertaining to minimum excess availability and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements. An unexpected decline in our revenues or operating income, including occurring as a result of events beyond our control, could cause us to violate our financial covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Further, as the amount available to us under our credit facilities is subject to borrowing base calculations determined by the value of accounts receivable, inventory, real estate and machinery and equipment (under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility), an unexpected decline in the value of these assets would require a mandatory prepayment. If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts and other monetary obligations as they come due, and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our stock price and could result in a significant loss of value for our shareholders. Furthermore, the lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings, which could leave us without access to sufficient liquidity to operate our business. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, real estate and intellectual property. If the debt under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt. 
 Additionally, our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility also contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe to be in our long-term best interests. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company and our subsidiaries to: 
 incur additional indebtedness; 
 pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock; 
 make certain acquisitions or investments; 
 sell assets; and 
 engage in certain business activities. 
 Currently, our AES subsidiary is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable and the amounts of such losses could be substantial. Lufthansa Technik AG Lufthansa filed actions in Germany, the United Kingdom UK and France. These matters are more fully discussed in Note 19 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Form 10-K, and in Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, Financial Information of this report. In both Germany and the UK, the Company has been found to infringe the patents of Lufthansa and will be subject to monetary damages, estimates of which have been accrued as liabilities in our financial statements, but the actual amount of damages that may be addressed in the future could be substantially higher. In the matter before the UK High Court of Justice, Lufthansa has pleaded its case for monetary compensation at a separate trial which was 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 conducted in October 2024. Lufthansa is seeking damages significantly higher than the amount which has been accrued as a liability by the Company. Lufthansa has calculated its loss as up to 107 million, excluding interest. While we believe we have valid defenses and are vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings, if the monetary damages award is decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, or business, and, based upon the amount of such damages award, there could be scenarios in which it could be difficult for the Company to satisfy the amount of such damages, in whole or in part. While the Company is performing scenario planning and is engaged with its lenders to seek to be in a position to cover the range of possible outcomes and satisfy any potential damages, these activities and other activities that the Company may undertake may not be successful or may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of any damages assessed.
