Overview 

enVVeno
Medical Corporation is a late clinical-stage medical device company focused on the advancement of innovative bioprosthetic (tissue-based)
solutions to improve the standard of care for the treatment of venous disease. Chronic Venous Disease CVD is the world s
most prevalent chronic disease, impacting approximately 70 of the adult population of the U.S. Chronic Venous Insufficiency CVI ),
is a large subset of CVD, which most often occurs when valves inside of the veins of the leg become damaged, resulting in the backwards
flow of blood (reflux), blood pooling in the lower leg, increased pressure in the veins of the leg (venous hypertension) and in severe
cases, venous ulcers that are difficult to heal. The Company is developing surgical and non-surgical replacement venous valves for patients
suffering from severe CVI of the deep venous system of the leg. 

The
Company s lead product is the VenoValve , which is a potential first-in-class surgical replacement venous valve that is currently
being evaluated in a U.S. pivotal study called the SAVVE trial (Surgical Anti-reflux Venous Valve Endoprosthesis). Definitive one year data from SAVVE is expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

The
Company is also developing the next generation replacement venous valve called enVVe , which will be delivered via transcatheter
as opposed to an open surgery. The Company is conducting pre-clinical testing on enVVe and currently expects to be ready to file for
IDE approval for the enVVe pivotal trial in mid
2025. 

Both
the VenoValve and enVVe are designed to act as one-way valves, to help assist in propelling blood up the veins of the leg, and back to
the heart and lungs. 

The
VenoValve and enVVe are being developed first for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). We expect to
be eligible to file for FDA approval of the VenoValve in the fourth quarter of 2024 followed approximately three years later by enVVe. If approved,
we expect the VenoValve and enVVe to co-exist, with the VenoValve as a surgical replacement venous valve option and enVVe as a non-surgical
replacement venous valve option, although we cannot provide any assurance that either the VenoValve or enVVe will receive approval from
the FDA. There are currently no devices approved as surgical or non-surgical replacement venous valves, and there are currently no effective
treatments for deep venous CVI caused by incompetent valves. 

Our
team of officers and directors has been affiliated with numerous medical devices that have received FDA approval or CE marking and that
have been commercially successful. We develop and manufacture both the VenoValve and EnVVe in a 14,000 sq. ft. leased manufacturing facility
in Irvine, California, which has been ISO 13485-2016 certified for the design, development and manufacturing of tissue based implantable
medical devices.

CVI
Background 

Chronic
venous disease (CVD) is the world s most prevalent chronic disease. CVD is clinically classified using a standardized system known
as CEAP (clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological). The CEAP system consists of seven clinical classifications (C0 to
C6) with C4, C5 and C6 being the most severe categories of CVD. 

Chronic
Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is a large subset of CVD and is generally used to describe patients with C4 to C6 CVD. CVI is a debilitating
condition that affects the venous system of the leg causing pain, swelling, edema, skin changes, and ulcerations. 

The
human leg contains three vein systems: the deep vein system, the superficial vein system, and the perforator vein system which connects
the deep system to the superficial system. The deep venous system is located below the muscle and facia in the center portion of the
leg and is responsible for approximately 90 of the blood flow. In order for blood to return to the heart from the foot, ankle, and lower
leg, the calf muscle serves as a pump and pushes the blood up the veins of the leg against gravity and through a series of one-way valves.
Each valve is supposed to open as blood passes through, and then close as blood progresses up the veins of the leg to the next valve.
CVI occurs when the one-way valves in the veins of the leg fail and become incompetent. When the valves fail, gravity causes the blood
to flow backwards and in the wrong direction (reflux). As blood pools in the lower leg, pressure inside the veins increases (venous hypertension).
Reflux, and the resulting venous hypertension, causes the leg to swell, resulting in debilitating pain, and in the most severe cases,
venous ulcers. 

Severe
CVI sufferers experience a significantly reduced quality of life. Daily activities such as preparing meals, housework, dressing, and
personal hygiene (washing and bathing) become difficult due to reduced mobility. For many severe CVI sufferers, intense pain, which
frequently occurs at night, prevents them from getting adequate sleep. Severe CVI sufferers are known to miss approximately 40 more
workdays than the average worker. A high percentage of venous ulcer patients also experience severe itching, leg swelling, and an
odorous discharge. Wound dressing changes, which occur several times a week, can be extremely painful. Venous ulcers from deep
venous CVI are very difficult to heal, and a significant percentage of venous ulcers remain unhealed for more than a year. Even if
healed, recurrence rates for venous ulcers are known to be high (20 to 40 within the first year and as high as 60 after five
years. Patients with severe CVI often become housebound and experience social isolation due to difficulty with ambulation. As a
result, studies have shown that patients with active venous ulcers experience higher rates of anxiety and depression, with reported
rates of anxiety of up to 30 and depression up to 40 . Rates of depression caused by venous ulcers among the elderly are even
higher, with 48 of elderly venous ulcer patients having severe depressive symptoms. 

Prevalence
is generally defined as the portion of the population that has a given condition. Estimates indicate that the prevalence of people in
the U.S. with severe, deep venous CVI (C4 to C6 disease) with reflux to be approximately 20 million. Incidence is generally defined as
the number of new cases of an ailment that develop in a given time period. We estimate that approximately 3.5 million new patients with
severe deep venous CVI are diagnosed each year in the U.S. including patients that develop venous leg ulcers (C6 patients). The average
patient seeking treatment of a venous ulcer spends as much as 30,000 a year on wound care, and the total direct medical costs from venous
ulcer sufferers in the U.S. has been estimated to exceed 3 billion a year. 

10 

VenoValve 

The
VenoValve is a replacement venous valve developed at enVVeno Medical to be surgically implanted in the deep venous system
of the leg to treat severe CVI caused by valvular incompetence. By lowering pressure (venous hypertension) within the deep venous system
of the leg, the VenoValve has the potential to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of severe deep venous CVI, including the potential to
heal recurring venous leg ulcers. The VenoValve is implanted into the femoral vein of the patient in an open surgical procedure via a
5-to-6-inch incision in the upper thigh. As our planned initial entrant to the replacement venous valve market, we estimate that approximately
2.5 million people each year with severe deep venous CVI in the U.S. would be candidates for the VenoValve. The VenoValve has been granted
Breakthrough Device designation by the FDA. 

VenoValve
Clinical Status 

In
March of 2021 we received IDE approval from the FDA to begin the VenoValve pivotal study. An investigational device exemption or IDE
from the FDA is required before a medical device company can proceed with a pivotal trial for a Class III medical device. This approval
allowed us to proceed with our U.S. pivotal study for the VenoValve which is called the SAVVE (Surgical Anti-reflux Venous Valve Endoprosthesis)
clinical study. The SAVVE study is a prospective, non-blinded, single arm, multi-center study of seventy-five (75) CVI patients enrolled
at 21 U.S. sites. 

Efficacy
endpoints for the SAVVE pivotal study include rVCSS scores, which are used to provide evidence of clinically meaningful benefit, as well
as reflux time measurements, VAS pain scores, quality of life measurements, ulcer healing (for CEAP class C6 patients), and intra-operative
and one-year vein patency and valve functionality. Safety endpoints include device related events and procedure related events including
mortality, pulmonary embolism, ipsilateral deep vein thrombosis, infection and bleeding. 

We
achieved full enrollment of 75 subjects in the SAVVE trial on September 1, 2023, having enrolled eighteen (18) patients over the final
two (2) months of the study. 

11 

On
November 16, 2023, we presented preliminary device related thirty-day Device Related Material Adverse Event MAE data
at the 50th Annual VEITH Symposium. The preliminary device related MAE rate for the fully enrolled 75 subject study was eight percent
(8 ). MAEs for the SAVVE study are defined as all-cause mortality, pulmonary embolisms PEs ), ipsilateral deep vein thromboses DVTs ), bleeding, and deep wound infections, occurring within thirty (30) days of enrollment in the study, being either
device or procedure related. The device related MAEs presented at the conference indicated no deaths, no pulmonary embolisms, and six
(6) DVTs, from the fully enrolled cohort of 75 patients. Subsequent to the VEITH presentation, two (2) of the DVTs were adjudicated by
the SAVVE Clinical Events Committee CEC as being moderate and four (4) of the DVTs were adjudicated as being mild. In
addition to the DVTs, the safety report also noted a higher-than-expected rate of pocket wound hematomas (anti-coagulation related bleeding
outside of the target vein within the surgical cavity) within the first two (2) weeks after surgery, which were deemed to be moderate
in severity by the CEC, as well as an expected rate of procedure related wound infections at the site of the skin incisions. The bleeds
and wound infections were acute in nature and had no lasting negative impact on patient health or clinical outcomes. 

On
March 6, 2024, we released initial, six-month topline preliminary revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (rVCSS) efficacy data from the
SAVVE study at the VENOUS2024 American Venous Forum Annual Meeting, in Tampa Florida. The data released at VENOUS 2024 indicated that,
overall, 97 of the study patients receiving the VenoValve showed clinical improvement as measured by rVCSS at six months, compared to
baseline, with 74 of the study patients improving the three (3) or more rVCSS points needed to demonstrate VenoValve s clinical
meaningful benefit (the Clinical Meaningful Benefit ). The average improvement among the Clinical Meaningful Benefit cohort
was 8 points, more than two and a half times the amount of rVCSS improvement required to demonstrate that the VenoValve provides Clinical
Meaningful Benefit. 

On
April 24, 2024, follow-on preliminary rVCSS data was presented at the 46th Annual Charing Cross Symposium in London, England. At a weighted
average subject follow-up of 11.64 months, the average improvement among the Clinical Meaningful Benefit 3 point rVCSS improvement)
patient cohort was 8.46 points, including 9.29 points for patients at the two-year milestone, 8.08 points for patients at the one-year
milestone, and 8.71 points for patients at the six-month milestone. All rVCSS evaluations were based on the patient s most recent
clinical visit, compared to baseline. Overall, 94 of the study patients receiving the VenoValve showed clinical improvement as measured
by rVCSS, at a weighted-average patient follow-up of 11.04 months for the clinical improvement cohort, and 72 of the study patients
improved the three or more rVCSS points needed to demonstrate the VenoValve s Clinical Meaningful Benefit, at a weighted-average
patient follow-up of 11.64 months for the Clinical Meaningful Benefit cohort. Total patient follow-up was 762 months for the clinical
improvement cohort and 582 months for the Clinical Meaningful Benefit cohort. 

On
June 21, 2024, the Company presented data showing significant improvement for patients with venous ulcers enrolled in the SAVVE study
at the Society for Vascular Surgery 2024 Vascular Annual Meeting in Chicago. The data presented included twenty-one venous ulcer patients
who had reached their one-year milestone, representing thirty venous ulcers. Overall, 91 of venous ulcer patients evaluated at one year
either had fully healed ulcers or ulcers that had improved. Of that group, 100 of venous ulcers with a duration of one year or less
prior to VenoValve surgery were fully healed, with the majority (67 fully healed 90 days after VenoValve surgery. For those with venous
ulcers with a duration of more than one year prior to VenoValve surgery, 89 were either fully healed or improved at one year, representing
a decrease in average of total ulcers of 85 . In addition, none of the patients with a fully healed venous ulcer had experienced an ulcer
recurrence. 

The
FDA has indicated that one-year data on all patients will be necessary prior to completing the application seeking
pre-market approval PMA for the VenoValve. On August 14, 2024, the Company announced it had filed and the FDA had approved four of the required five modules
of its PMA application. The Company expects to file the fifth and final module of its PMA application in Q4 of
2024. 

enVVe 

On
September 21, 2022, we announced the development of a non-surgical transcatheter based replacement venous valve called enVVe , for
the treatment of CVI of the deep veins of the leg. enVVe is designed to be delivered into the femoral vein of the patient via a minimally invasive
procedure requiring no general anesthesia and no overnight hospital stay. Due to the minimally invasive nature of the procedure, we expect
to be able to reach patients with less severe CVI or who may otherwise be poor candidates for a surgical device, and estimate the U.S.
market for enVVe to be approximately 3.5 million patients. 

On October 28,
2024, we announced the successful start to a six-month pre-clinical GLP study for enVVe. The first wave of implants, for the
long-term subjects, was successfully completed, with the final wave for the shorter-term subjects scheduled for December. The GLP
study is a prerequisite to seeking IDE approval from the FDA to begin the enVVe U.S. pivotal study.
The Company expects to file for IDE approval for the enVVe pivotal study in mid 2025. 

Capital 

We
finished 2023 with approximately 46.4 million of cash and investments and had approximately 48.4 million of cash and investments at
September 30, 2024. Our future capital requirements will remain dependent upon a variety of factors, especially including the success
of our clinical trials, related product development costs, and our ability to successfully bring products to market. We anticipate that
our cash burn rate will increase from current levels of approximately 4 million to 5 million per quarter as we conduct our clinical
trials and work toward bringing our product candidates to market. 

On
September 30, 2024, we closed a public offering raising approximately 13.6 million net cash proceeds. Based on management s
current expectations, this capital has the potential to fund the Company through several significant milestones, including the anticipated FDA pre-market approval of the VenoValve, the beginning of preparations for
VenoValve commercialization, and the initial stages of the pivotal trial for enVVe. Although we expect our quarterly cash burn rate will increase over time to support these milestones, after the additional
proceeds from our offering, we believe we have sufficient cash to fund operations past what we expect will be regulatory approval of
the VenoValve and the start of the enVVe pivotal trial.

Comparison
of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Overview 

We
reported net losses of 5.6 million and 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing
an increase in net loss of 0.6 million or 12 , due to an increase in operating expenses of 0.8 million, and an increase in other income
of 0.2 million. 

Revenues 

As
a developmental stage Company, we are not currently generating revenue and our future revenue, if any, is expected to be diminutive in
the near future and dependent on our ability to commercialize our product candidates. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased by 0.1 million or 2 , to 2.9 million from 2.8
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily resulted from 0.2 million in increased personnel costs
to support the SAVVE study and enVVe development, partially offset by a 0.1 million decrease in lab costs. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.7 million or 27 , to 3.3
million from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to a 0.2 million increase in
consulting expense related to market research for the Company s products, and a 0.7 million increase in legal costs,
partially offset by a 0.1 million decrease in share-based compensation, and a 0.1 million decrease in travel expenses due to full
enrollment of the SAVVE study during 2023 resulting in less travel to study sites in 2024. 

Other Income 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income increased 0.2 million or 52.0 to 0.5 million from 0.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Other income in both periods reflects realized gains, interest, and unrealized gains from our program
to invest excess cash in US Treasury bills. 

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Overview 

We
reported net losses of 15.6 million and 17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing
a decrease in net loss of 2.3 million, or 13 , due to a decrease in operating expenses of 1.8 million, and an increase in other income
of 0.4 million. 

Revenues 

As
a developmental stage Company, we are not currently generating revenue and our future revenue, if any, is expected to be diminutive in
the near future and dependent on our ability to commercialize our product candidates. 

13 

Research
and Development Expenses 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased by 1.9 million or 18 , to 8.7 million from 10.6
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

This
decrease resulted from a 2.7 million reduction in costs related the SAVVE study as it reached full enrollment during the 2023 period
requiring less study related enrollment activity during the 2024 period, partially offset by 0.8 million higher compensation cost due
to increases in staffing. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses of 8.4 million
were flat when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is due to 1.0 million in lower share-based compensation
from the reduction in expense from grants made during 2021, the cost for portions of which have been fully recognized, a 0.1 million
decrease in travel expenses due to full enrollment of the SAVVE study during 2023 resulting in less travel to study sites in 2024, partially
offset by 0.8 million in higher legal cost and a 0.3 million increase in consulting expense related to market research for the Company s
products. 

Other Income 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income increased 0.4 million to 1.5 million from 1.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. Other income in both periods reflects realized gains, interest, and unrealized gains from our program to invest excess
cash in U.S. bills. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

For
the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 15.6 million and used 11.7 million cash in operating activities.
Net cash used in operating activities for the period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.2 million from 13.9 million for the period
ended September 30, 2023. 

The
losses and the uses of cash are primarily due to the Company s administrative and product research and development activities.
Administrative functions relate to costs to support the Company s public reporting and investor relations activities, readying for commercial development of its lead product candidate in the event of receiving PMA approval from the
FDA, and
internal administrative functions. Research and development activities are for continued product development and clinical trials for
our product candidates, currently the VenoValve and enVVe . The Company will continue to incur these costs to complete its clinical
trials, enhance products, develop new products, and operate as a public company. Although we have discretion in how we use the Company s
cash resources, we expect to continue these activities for the foreseeable future as we seek to develop and obtain regulatory approval
for our product candidates. We are not currently generating revenue and do not expect significant revenue until we successfully commercialize
one or more of our product candidates. 

Our
cash flows from investing activity consist of maturities and purchases of US Treasury bills from our program to invest excess cash, and
purchases of property and equipment for our lab and offices. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we purchased 33.4 million
of treasury bills and 45.8 million of them matured generating 1.4 million in realized gains and interest income. We expect to continue
investing as the treasury bills mature and as allowed by the cash requirements of our operations. In the nine months ended September
30, 2024, our purchases of property and equipment consisting primarily of lab and test equipment, were less than 0.1 million. 

We
do not currently have material commitments for capital expenditures or other expenditures except for our facility lease commitment of
 0.4 million per year. However, we expect a modest increase in purchases of property and equipment as we continue SAVVE, plan for commercialization
of the VenoValve and continue development of enVVe. Our future capital requirements will remain dependent upon a variety of factors,
especially including the success of our clinical trials and related product development costs and our ability to successfully bring products
to market. 

14 

We have historically funded our operations through financing activities. On September 30, 2024, we closed an offering issuing stock
and warrants and raising approximately 13.6 million net cash proceeds. Based upon our cash and working capital as of September 30, 2024
we have sufficient capital resources to meet our obligations as they become due for at least one year after the date of this Report and
sustain operations, although we expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital
to sustain our operations, pursue our product development initiatives and penetrate markets for the sale of our products. Any inability
to raise additional financing in the foreseeable future would have a material adverse effect on us. 

As
of October 28, 2024, we had cash and investments of 47.1 million.

Item
4: Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our
management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (who is our Principal
Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who is our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer), of the
effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of
September 30, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, or in other factors
that could significantly affect these controls, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
error and all fraud. Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
