 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit Standby letters of credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer and generally consists of real estate. The Bank does not issue any guarantees that would require liability recognition or disclosure, other than its standby letters of credit. Standby letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Generally, all letters of credit, when issued, have expiration dates within one year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as those that are involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank, generally, holds

 At September 30, 2024, the Company had debt securities in an unrealized loss position in the less than twelve months category and debt securities in the twelve months or more category. In Management s opinion the unrealized losses reflect changes in interest rates subsequent to the acquisition of specific securities. The Company concluded that the decline in the value of these securities was not indicative of a credit loss. The Company did t recognize any credit losses on these available for sale debt securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not have the intent to sell the securities and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the securities before recovery of its cost basis. The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of September 30, 2024 by contractual maturity are shown below.

 Management uses an eight point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first four categories are considered not criticized, and are aggregated as Pass rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The Special Mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a Substandard classification. Loans in the Substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. All loans greater than 90 days past due are considered Substandard. Any portion of a loan that has been charged off is placed in the Loss category. To help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Bank has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as nonperformance, repossession, or death

and over to re-affirm risk ratings. Management further monitors the performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio by analyzing the age of the portfolio as determined by the length of time a recorded payment is past due. The following table presents the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aging categories of performing loans and nonaccrual loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): - Commercial - Agricultural - - - - - Construction - - - Commercial loans - Other agricultural loans - - Consumer loans - Total -

 Management reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis using a defined, consistently applied process in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. When information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against the allowance.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses related to loans totaling . Factors impacting the provision include changes in the cumulative loss rates applied to the respective loan pools due to loss activity being added or subtracted with the passage of time, and variances in Qualitative Factors and Economic Factors. The cumulative loss rate used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses is comprised of the Company s historical loss experience. The Company chose to apply qualitative factors based on quantitative metrics which link the quantifiable metrics to historical changes in the qualitative factor categories. The Company also chose to apply economic projections to the model. A select group of economic indicators was utilized which was then correlated to the historical loss experience of the Company and its peers. Based on the correlation results, the economic adjustments are then weighted for relevancy and applied to the individual loan pools.

 Occasionally, the Bank modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, and other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Bank provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of 10 relationships.

 Securities: The fair value of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, management s best estimate is used. Management s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) are used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments, if applicable. Interest Rate Swaps: The fair value of interest rate swaps is based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows using the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR swap curve, the basis for the underlying interest rate. To price interest rate swaps, cash flows are first projected for each payment date using the fixed rate for the fixed side of the swap and the forward rates for the floating side of the swap. These swap cash flows are then discounted to time zero using SOFR zero-coupon interest rates. The sum of the present value of both legs is the fair market value of the interest rate swap. These valuations have been derived from our third party vendor s proprietary models rather than actual market quotations. The proprietary models are based upon financial principles and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.

Foreclosed real estate owned: Real estate properties acquired through loan foreclosures, or by deed in lieu of loan foreclosure are to be sold and are carried at fair value less estimated cost to sell. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised value of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. These assets are included in Level 3 fair value based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

 (1) Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include various Level 3 inputs which are not identifiable, less any associated allowance. (2) Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses. The range and weighted average of liquidation expenses and other appraisal adjustments are presented as a percent of the appraisal. Assets and Liabilities Not Required to be Measured or Reported at Fair Value The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Company s assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s financial instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Loans receivable (carried at cost): The fair values of loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using market rates at the balance sheet date that reflect the credit and interest rate-risk inherent in the loans. Projected future cash flows are calculated based upon contractual maturity or call dates, projected repayments and prepayments of principal. Generally, for variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. Mortgage servicing rights (generally carried at cost) The Company utilizes a third party provider to estimate the fair value of certain loan servicing rights. Fair value for the purpose of this measurement is defined as the amount at which the asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation. Deposit liabilities (carried at cost): The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and noninterest checking, passbook savings and money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered in the market on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include certain forward-looking statements based on current management expectations. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods or by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may , will , believe , expect , estimate , anticipate , continue , or similar terms or variations on those terms, or the negative of those terms. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those management expectations. This includes statements regarding general economic conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, changes in tax policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities and failure to integrate or profitably operate acquired businesses. Additional potential factors include changes in interest rates, the rate of inflation, deposit flows, cost of funds, demand for loan products and financial services, competition and changes in the quality or composition of loan and investment portfolios of the Company. Other factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, and other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the Company s operations, markets, products, services and prices, instability in the banking system, and the potential for a recessionary economy. Further description of the risks and uncertainties to the business are included in the Company s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature, and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation does have an impact on the Company, particularly with respect to the growth of total assets and noninterest expenses, which tend to rise during periods of general inflation. Risks also exist due to supply and demand imbalances, employment shortages, the interest rate environment, and geopolitical tensions. It is reasonably foreseeable that estimates made in the financial statements could be materially and adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions, including expected credit losses on loans and the fair value of financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding our exposure to changes in the interest rate environment. Earnings and liquidity depend to a great extent on our interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions, geopolitical tensions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates . The nature and timing of any changes in interest rates or general economic conditions and their effect on us cannot be controlled and are difficult to predict. If the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, could contract and be materially adversely affected. Our earnings could also be materially adversely affected if the rates on interest-earning assets fall more quickly than those on our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates could also create competitive pressures, which could impact our liquidity position. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Asset/Liability Management. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Critical Accounting Policies Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (included in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023) lists significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of its financial statements. This discussion and analysis, the significant accounting policies, and other financial statement disclosures identify and address key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are necessary for an understanding and evaluation of the Company and its results of operations. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, and the determination of goodwill impairment. Please refer to the discussion of the allowance for credit losses calculation under Changes in Financial Condition - Loans below. In connection with the acquisition of North Penn in 2011, we recorded goodwill in the amount of 9.7 million, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of the net assets of the institution acquired at the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisition of Delaware in 2016, we recorded goodwill in the amount of 1.6 million, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of the net assets of the institution acquired at the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisition of UpState New 

 34 

York Bancorp, Inc. in July 2020, we recorded goodwill in the amount of 17.9 million, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of the net assets of the institution acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Changes in Financial Condition General Total assets as of September 30, 2024 were 2.280 billion compared to 2.201 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 71.5 million increase in gross loans outstanding. Securities The fair value of securities available for sale as of September 30, 2024 was 396.9 million compared to 406.3 million as of December 31, 2023. In Management s opinion the unrealized losses reflect changes in interest rates subsequent to the acquisition of specific securities. The Company concluded that the decrease in the value of these securities was not indicative of a credit loss. The Company did not recognize any credit losses on these available for sale debt securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company does not have the intent to sell the securities and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the securities before recovery of its cost basis. Loans Loans receivable totaled 1.656 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.585 billion as of December 31, 2023. The 71.8 million increase in net loans receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due primarily to a 40.3 million increase in commercial real estate loans, a 4.9 million increase in residential real estate loans and a 33.8 million increase in consumer loans, partially offset by a 7.3 million decrease in commercial, agricultural and construction loans, net. The allowance for credit losses totaled 18,699,000 as of September 30, 2024, and represented 1.12 of total loans outstanding, compared to 18,968,000, or 1.18 of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2023. The Company had net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1,157,000, compared to 2,897,000 in the corresponding period in 2023. The Company s management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Based on management s best judgement, the qualitative factors are applied to the final adjusted loss rate each quarter. Management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate at September 30, 2024 based on the Company s criteria. However, there can be no assurance that the allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover significant losses, if any, which might be incurred in the future. As of September 30, 2024, non-performing loans totaled 7,888,000 or 0.47 of total loans compared to 7,622,000, or 0.48 , of total loans at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, non-performing assets totaled 7,888,000, or 0.35 , of total assets, compared to 7,719,000, or 0.35 , of total assets at December 31, 2023.

 Deposits During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, total deposits increased 60.1 million due primarily to a 38.9 million increase in interest-bearing demand and a 33.4 million increase in certificates of deposit, partially offset by a 12.2 million decrease in other all other deposit categories, net. The following table sets forth deposit balances as of the dates indicated: (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Non-interest bearing demand 420,967 399,545 Interest-bearing demand 291,989 253,133 Money market deposit accounts 188,404 206,928 Savings 211,340 226,444 Time deposits 489,908 439,610 Time deposits > 250,000 252,643 269,499 Total 1,855,251 1,795,159 
 Borrowings Short-term borrowings decreased 21.7 million to 52.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 74.1 million at December 31, 2023, due primarily to an decrease in overnight borrowings. Other borrowings as of September 30, 2024, were 145.0 million compared to 124.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Federal Reserve Bank borrowings increased 30.0 million during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, contributing to the increase. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings decreased 9.3 million during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024.

 Stockholders Equity and Capital Ratios As of September 30, 2024, total stockholders equity was 195.7 million, compared to 181.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Total stockholders equity increased 12.5 million due to net income and 9.3 million due to an increase in the fair value of securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, offset partially by 7.3 million of dividends declared, net of tax. Because of interest rate volatility, the Company s accumulated other comprehensive income could materially fluctuate for each interim and year-end period. Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted regulatory capital rules pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the Bank Holding Company Act BHCA ). The Federal Reserve s capital rules are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the FDIC. The Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, however, exempts from the regulatory capital requirements bank holding companies with less than 3.0 billion in consolidated assets that are not engaged in significant non-banking or off-balance sheet activities and that do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC. As long as their bank subsidiaries are well capitalized, such bank holding companies need only maintain a pro forma debt to equity ratio of less than 1.0 in order to pay dividends and repurchase stock and to be eligible for expedited treatment on applications. A comparison of the Company s consolidated regulatory capital ratios is as follows: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Tier 1 Capital (To average assets) 9.03 9.00 Tier 1 Capital (To risk-weighted assets) 11.74 11.99 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (To risk-weighted assets) 11.74 11.99 Total Capital (To risk-weighted assets) 12.78 13.06 
 The Bank is required to comply with applicable capital adequacy rules adopted by the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies (the Basel III Capital Rules ). The Basel III Capital Rules apply to all depository institutions as well as to all top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies that are not subject to the Federal Reserve Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, banks are required to meet four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 or core capital leverage ratio equal to at least 4 of total adjusted assets; (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio equal to 4.5 of risk-weighted assets; (3) a Tier 1 risk-based ratio equal to 6 of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a total capital ratio equal to 8 of total risk-weighted assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital is defined as common stock instruments, retained earnings, any common equity Tier 1 minority interest and, unless the bank has made an opt-out election, accumulated other comprehensive income, net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Tier 1 or core capital is defined as common equity Tier 1 capital plus certain qualifying subordinated interests and 

 37 

grandfathered capital instruments. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25 of risk-weighted assets, qualifying subordinated instruments and certain grandfathered capital instruments. An institution s risk-based capital requirements are measured against risk-weighted assets, which equal the sum of each on-balance-sheet asset and the credit-equivalent amount of each off-balance-sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight. Risk weightings range from 0 for cash to 100 for property acquired through foreclosure, commercial loans, and certain other assets to 150 for exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. In addition to the above minimum requirements, the Basel III Capital Rules require banks and covered financial institution holding companies to maintain a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5 of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7 for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5 for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5 for Total Capital on a fully phased-in basis. The Company and the Bank were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements as of September 30, 2024. In December 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that a banking organization that experiences a reduction in retained earnings due to the CECL adoption as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which CECL is adopted may elect to phase in the regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL. Transitional amounts are calculated for the following items: retained earnings, temporary difference deferred tax assets and credit loss allowances eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital. When calculating regulatory capital ratios, 25 of the transitional amounts are phased in during the first year. An additional 25 of the transitional amounts are phased in over each of the next two years and at the beginning of the fourth year, the day-one effects of CECL are completely reflected in regulatory capital. The Company adopted the transition guidance applied these effects to regulatory capital in the first quarter of 2023 upon adoption of CECL. Liquidity As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 82.9 million in the form of cash, due from banks and short-term deposits with other institutions. In addition, the Company had total securities available for sale of 396.9 million which could be used for liquidity needs. Total liquidity of 479.8 million as of September 30, 2024, represents 21.0 of total assets, compared to 472.4 million and 21.5 of total assets as of December 31, 2023. The Company also monitors other liquidity measures, all of which were within the Company s policy guidelines as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Based upon these measures, the Company believes its liquidity is adequate. Capital Resources The Company has a line of credit commitment from Atlantic Community Bankers Bank for 7,000,000 which expires June 30, 2025. There were no borrowings under this line as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has a line of credit commitment available which has no stated expiration date from PNC Bank for 10,000,000. There were no borrowings under this line as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Bank s maximum borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank was approximately 678,033,000 as of September 30, 2024, of which 84.959,000 was outstanding in the form of borrowings as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum borrowing capacity was 682,417,000, of which 114,236,000 of borrowings was outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank had secured Letters of Credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank in the amount of 145,975,000 as collateral for specific municipal deposits. These Letters of Credit reduce the availability under the maximum borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2023, there was 136,650,000 outstanding in the form of Letters of Credit. Advances and Letters of Credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This report contains or references fully taxable-equivalent (fte) interest income and net interest income, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Interest income (fte) and net interest income (fte) are derived from GAAP interest income and net interest income using an assumed tax rate of 21 . We believe the presentation of interest income (fte) and net interest income (fte) ensures comparability of interest income and net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Interest income (fte) and Net interest income (fte) is reconciled to GAAP interest income and net interest income on pages 40 and 44. Fully taxable equivalent interest income and net interest income is also reflected in the table on pages 41 and 45. 

 38

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2023 General For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income totaled 3,844,000 compared to net income of 4,119,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due primarily to a 463,000 increase in the provision for credit losses. Earnings per share for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.48 per share for basic shares and fully diluted shares, compared to 0.51 per share for basic shares and for fully diluted shares for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The resulting annualized return on average assets and annualized return on average equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.68 and 8.09 , respectively, compared to 0.76 and 9.33 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. The following table sets forth changes in net income: (dollars in thousands) Three months ended September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2023 Net income three months ended September 30, 2023 4,119 Change due to: Net interest income 892 Provision for credit losses (463) Net gains on sales of securities and loans 85 Service charges and fees (10) Earnings and proceeds on bank-owned life insurance (67) Other income (19) Salaries and employee benefits (156) Occupancy, furniture and equipment (27) Data processing related (286) Professional fees (52) All other expenses (234) Income tax expense 62 Net income three months ended September 30, 2024 3,844 
 Net Interest Income Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (fte) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 16,138,000 which was 914,000 higher than the comparable period in 2023. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to a 4,001,000 increase in total interest income, which was partially offset by a 3,087,000 increase in total interest expense (fte). The (fte) net interest spread and net interest margin were 2.23 and 2.99 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.26 and 2.92 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures described above beginning on page 38. For the three-months ended September 30, 2024, interest income (fte) totaled 28,694,000, with a yield on average earning assets of 5.31 compared to 24,693,000 and 4.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average loans increased 62,447,000 million during the three-months ended September 30, 2024, over the comparable period of 2023, while average securities decreased 17,450,000 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average earning assets totaled 2.148 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 77.5 million, over average earning assets for the same period in 2023. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures described above beginning on page 38. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 12,556,000, at an average cost of 3.09 , compared to 9,469,000, at an average cost of 2.47 for the same period in 2023. The increase in interest expense during the three-months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the overall higher level of market interest rates. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average cost of time deposits, which is the most significant component of funding costs, increased 77 basis points compared to the same three-month period of last year, while interest-bearing demand and money market costs increased 91 basis points and short-term borrowing costs decreased 144 basis points compared to the same three-month period of 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses The Company had a provision for credit losses of 1,345,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision for credit loss expense of 882,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company makes provisions for, or releases of credit loss expense in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an acceptable level under the current expected credit loss methodology analysis. The Company recorded a net charge-off of 323,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net charge-off of 2,349,000 for the similar period in 2023. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses related to loans receivable was 1.12 of loans receivable. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses related to loans receivable represented 237 of non-performing loans. Other Income Other income totaled 2,295,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,306,000 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in earnings and proceeds on life insurance policies of 67,000. All other categories of other income increased 56,000, net, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other Expense Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 12,031,000, which was 755,000 higher than the same period of 2023, due primarily to a 286,000 increase in data processing expense, a 85,000 increase in FDIC insurance, and a 156,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits during the three months ended September 30, 2024. All other categories of other expense increased 228,000, net, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense totaled 1,006,000 for an effective tax rate of 20.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,068,000 for an effective tax rate of 20.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net Interest Income Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (fte) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 46,167,000 which was 1,161,000 lower than the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due primarily to a 14,848,000 increase in total interest expense, which was partially offset by a 13,687,000 increase in total interest income (fte). The (fte) net interest spread and net interest margin were 2.12 and 2.87 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.56 and 3.10 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures described above beginning on page 38. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, interest income (fte) totaled 83,696,000, with a yield on average earning assets of 5.20 compared to interest income (fte) of 70,009,000, with a yield on average earning assets of 4.59 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average loans increased 78.9 million during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, over the comparable period of 2023, while average securities decreased 18.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average earning assets totaled 2.152 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 110.1 million, compared to average earning assets for the same period in 2023. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures described above beginning on page 38. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 37,529,000, at an average cost of 3.07 , compared to 22,681,000, at an average cost of 2.02 , for the same period in 2023. The increase in interest expense during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the overall higher level of market interest rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average cost of time deposits, which is the most significant component of funding costs, increased 124 basis points compared to the same nine-month period of 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing demand and money market deposits increased 109 basis points, while short-term borrowing costs decreased 110 basis points, compared to the same nine-month period of 2023. Provision for Credit Losses The Company had a provision for credit loss expense of 1,069,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a release of provision for credit loss expense of 568,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company makes provisions for, or releases of, credit loss expense in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an acceptable level under the current expected credit loss methodology analysis. The Company had net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 1,157,000, compared to 2,897,000 in the corresponding period in 2023. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses related to loans receivable was 1.12 of total loans receivable. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses related to total loans receivable represented 237 of non-performing loans. Other Income Other income totaled 6,508,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6,001,000 for the same period in 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase of 172,000 in the level of service charges and fees, along with an increase of 

 46 

327,000 in gains on sales of securities and sales on loans. All other categories of other income increased 8,000, net, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other Expense Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 35,206,000, which was 2,557,000 or 7.8 , higher than the same period of 2023, due primarily to a 435,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, a 537,000 increase in professional fees, a 310,000 increase in FDIC insurance, and a 743,000 increase in data processing expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. All other categories of other expense increased 532,000, net, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense totaled 3,308,000 for an effective tax rate of 20.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4,289,000 for an effective tax rate of 20.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Asset/Liability Management Management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in our net income as a result of changes in interest rates. Our primary earnings source is net interest income, which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates, the relationship between rates, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments, the level and composition of deposits and liabilities, and the credit quality of earning assets. Our asset and liability management objectives are to maintain a strong, stable net interest margin, to utilize our capital effectively without taking undue risks, to maintain adequate liquidity, and to reduce vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates. Our Asset and Liability Committee evaluates periodically, but at least four times a year, the impact of changes in market interest rates on assets and liabilities, net interest margin, capital and liquidity. Risk assessments are governed by policies and limits established by senior management, which are reviewed and approved by the full Board of Directors at least annually. The economic environment continually presents uncertainties as to future interest rate trends. The Asset and Liability Committee regularly utilizes a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates, in order to be better able to respond to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the value of our interest-earning assets and, in particular, our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest-earning assets, which could adversely affect our stockholders' equity and results of operations if sold. We are also subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates also could affect the type (fixed-rate or adjustable-rate) and amount of loans we originate and the average life of loans and securities, which can impact the yields earned on our loans and securities. In periods of decreasing interest rates, the average life of loans and securities we hold may be shortened to the extent increased prepayment activity occurs during such periods which, in turn, may result in the investment of funds from such prepayments in lower yielding assets. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may result in decreasing loan prepayments with respect to fixed rate loans (and therefore an increase in the average life of such loans), may result in a decrease in loan demand, and may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans . We utilize the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes. Management routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two-year horizon. The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and the interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. This sensitivity analysis is compared to the asset and liability policy limits that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one-year horizon given 100 and 200-basis point upward and downward shifts in interest rates. A parallel and pro-rata shift in rates over a twelve-month period is assumed. 

 47 

In addition to the above scenarios, we consider other non-parallel rate shifts that would also exert pressure on earnings. The current environment, which includes an inverted yield curve, presents a challenge to a bank, like us, that derives most of its revenue from net interest margin. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the yield on U.S. Treasury 5-year notes decreased 35 basis points from 3.93 to 3.58 , while the yield on 3-month Treasury bills decreased 73 basis points from 5.46 to 4.73 . The 3-month/5-year Treasury spread increased from a negative 153 basis points at December 31, 2023 to a negative 115 basis points at September 30, 2020, and continues to be considerably inverted compared to the 3-month/5-year Treasury spread of negative 43 basis points at December 31, 2022. A continued flat or inverted yield curve in 2025 may adversely affect net interest income as borrowers tend to refinance higher-rate fixed rate loans at lower rates and we may not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on those prepaid assets. The following reflects our net interest income sensitivity analysis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: September 30, 2024 Potential Change in Future Net Changes in Interest Interest Income Rates in Basis Points Year 1 Year 2 (Dollars in thousands) Change Change Change Change 200 (2,462) -3.5 (2,234) -2.7 100 (1,135) -1.6 (886) -1.1 Static - 0.0 - 0.0 (100) 564 0.8 (463) -0.6 (200) 318 0.5 (2,917) -3.6 December 31, 2023 Potential Change in Future Net Changes in Interest Interest Income Rates in Basis Points Year 1 Year 2 (Dollars in thousands) Change Change Change Change 200 (2,788) -4.4 (2,371) -3.1 100 (1,310) -2.0 (1,049) -1.4 Static - 0.0 - 0.0 (100) 1,931 3.0 169 0.2 (200) 1,166 1.8 (1,420) -1.9 
 As noted in the table above, a 200-basis point increase in interest rates is projected to decrease net interest income by 3.5 in year 1 and decrease net interest income by 2.7 in year 2. Our balance sheet sensitivity to such a move in interest rates at September 30, 2024 increased as compared to December 31, 2023 (which was a decrease of 4.4 in net interest income over a twelve-month period). This decrease is the result of a higher portion of our liabilities repricing higher. Overall, our strategy has been to proactively take advantage of the falling rate cycle in aggressively lowering deposit costs, ultimately dampening the effect of variable and adjustable-rate loan repricing and additional fixed rate loan refinancing. Over the intervening year, the effective duration (a measure of price sensitivity to interest rates) of the bond portfolio decreased from 6.05 years at September 30, 2023 to 5.2 years at September 30, 2024. The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied on as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based on numerous assumptions including, but not limited to, the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shapes, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While assumptions are developed based on perceived current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences may change. Also, as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those

assumed, the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets, the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans, depositor early withdrawals, prepayment penalties and product preference changes and other internal and external variables. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to, or anticipating, changes in interest rates and market conditions.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures The Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the Commission rules and forms. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings On February 20, 2024, the Company was notified of a Complaint (the Complaint entitled Ian Werkmeister vs . Wayne Bank, filed on February 12, 2024 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking class action status. The Plaintiff is seeking monetary recovery and other relief on behalf of themselves and one or more putative classes of other individuals similarly situated. The Complaint arises out of a widely reported data security incident involving MOVEit, a file sharing software used globally by government agencies, enterprise corporations, and financial institutions. In October of 2023, Wayne Bank was notified by its third-party information service provider of a cyber-incident that involved unauthorized access to Wayne Bank customer information in one of the vendor s file transfer applications. The incident involved vulnerabilities discovered in MOVEit Transfer, a file transfer software used by the Bank s vendor to support services provided by the vendor to Wayne Bank and its related institutions. MOVEit is a commonly used secure Managed File Transfer software, which supports file transfer activities used by thousands of organizations around the world, including government agencies and major financial firms. The vulnerability discovered in MOVEit did not involve any of Wayne Bank s internal systems and did not impact the Bank s ability to service its customers. The MOVEit cases have since been transferred and consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the Court and are now entitled MOVEit Customer Data Security Breach Litigation. On July 23, 2024, on behalf of all of the Defendants (including the Company) in this case, an omnibus Motion to Dismiss the cases for lack of Article III standing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was filed with the Court. A hearing on this motion was held on October 9, 2024. The Court gave no indication of when it might issue a ruling on the motion. The Court did indicate that it is also in the process of assembling a final bellwether structure. The next status conference is set for November 13, 2024. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in the Complaint and intends to vigorously defend itself against such Complaint. While we continue to measure the impact of this cyber-incident, including certain remediation expenses and other potential liabilities, we do not currently believe this incident will have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, or financial results. Other than the foregoing, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are involved in any other pending legal proceedings, other than routine legal matters occurring in the ordinary course of business, which in the aggregate involve amounts which are believed by management to be immaterial to the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
