 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 Our quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonality of our clients businesses and changes in holiday and vacation days taken. In addition, we typically experience higher costs in the first quarter of each fiscal year as a result of certain U.S. state and federal employment tax resets, which adversely affects our gross profit and overall profitability relative to the remainder of the fiscal year. As such, the results of operations for any interim period may be impacted by these factors, among others, and are not necessarily indicative of, nor comparable to, the results of operations for a full year.

 Litigation 
 We are involved in legal proceedings, claims and administrative matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we have made accruals with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, that are reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements but are not, individually or in the aggregate, considered material. For other matters for which an accrual has not been made, we have not yet determined that a loss is probable, or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, but we do not expect that these proceedings and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements; however, if decided adversely to us, or if we determine that settlement of particular litigation is appropriate, we may be subject to additional liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Kforce maintains liability insurance that insures us against workers compensation, personal and bodily injury, property damage, directors and officers liability, errors and omissions, cyber liability, employment practices liability and fidelity losses. There can be no assurance that Kforce s liability insurance will cover all events or that the limits of coverage will be sufficient to fully cover all liabilities.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 The following is an executive summary of what Kforce believes are highlights as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which should be considered in the context of the additional discussions herein and in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 9.1 to 1.06 billion from 1.17 billion in the comparable period in 2023. Revenue decreased 7.6 and 23.9 for Technology and FA, respectively, primarily driven by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. 
 Flex revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 8.7 (9.2 on a billing day basis) to 1.04 billion from 1.14 billion in the comparable period in 2023. Flex revenue decreased 7.2 (7.7 on a billing day basis) for Technology and 23.9 (24.3 on a billing day basis) for FA. These decreases were driven by a decrease in the number of consultants on assignment, although our 2024 sequential trends in Technology Flex revenue have shown stabilization. 
 Direct Hire revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 26.4 to 22.2 million from 30.1 million in the comparable period in 2023. 
 Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 40 basis points to 27.6 from 28.0 in the comparable period in 2023 as a result of a decline in the mix of Direct Hire revenue and Flex gross profit margins. 
 Flex gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 10 basis points to 26.0 from 26.1 in the comparable period in 2023. 
 SG A expenses as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained flat at 22.1 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 13.2 to 39.4 million, or 2.08 per share, from 45.4 million, or 2.31 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Firm returned 41.6 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of open market repurchases totaling 20.3 million and quarterly dividends totaling 21.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 65.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 69.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Business Overview 
 Kforce is a leading domestic provider of technology and finance and accounting talent solutions to innovative and industry-leading companies. As of September 30, 2024, Kforce employed over 1,700 associates and had approximately 7,900 consultants on assignment. Kforce serves clients across a diverse set of industries and organizations of all sizes, but we place a particular focus on serving Fortune 500 and other large companies. 
 Our strategic priorities for 2024 are to (a) continue transforming our back-office capabilities, inclusive of the implementation of Workday as our enterprise cloud application for human capital management and financial reporting; (b) further integrate our project solutions capabilities by capitalizing the strong relationships with our world-class clients utilizing our sales teams, recruiters and consultants; and (c) evolving our nearshore and offshore delivery capabilities. We have made significant progress across each of these strategic priorities. 
 As it relates to our strategic priority related to nearshore and offshore delivery capability, we have been intently listening to our clients and actively monitoring industry trends. An increasingly important vehicle to providing cost-effective solutions is the ability to source highly skilled talent outside of the United States. Following an executive trip in August 2024, management made the strategic decision to establish a development center in Pune, India. Pune is one of the leading technology cities in India, and we are tremendously excited about leveraging this capability to further enhance our service offerings to our clients. This development center is expected to begin supporting project engagements with our U.S.-based clients in January 2025. 
 Our results continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty though we have recently experienced stability (albeit at lower levels) in our Technology business. There are continuing significant geopolitical concerns including, but not limited to, U.S. political uncertainties (including the upcoming presidential election), tensions in the Middle East, and ongoing global supply chain issues. While it has largely been anticipated that the U.S. economy would fall into a recession given the aggressive interest rate increases since March 2022 by the Federal Reserve to combat significant inflation, the Federal Reserve reduced rates by 50 basis points in September and has signaled the possibility of further rate reductions. The rate reductions have strengthened expectations for a soft landing in the U.S. 
 Based on data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Staffing Industry Analysts SIA ), temporary employment figures and trends are important indicators of staffing demand from an economic standpoint. The national U.S. unemployment rate increased to 4.1 in September 2024 as compared to 3.7 in December 2023. In the latest U.S. staffing industry forecast published by SIA in September 2024, the technology temporary staffing industry and finance and accounting temporary staffing industry are estimated to decline 7 and 9 in 2024, respectively.

 Flex Revenue. The key drivers of Flex revenue are the number of consultants on assignment, billable hours, the bill rate per hour and, to a limited extent, the amount of billable expenses incurred by Kforce and billable to our clients. 
 Technology Flex revenue decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 3.6 (5.1 on a billing day basis) and 7.2 , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in the number of consultants on assignment. Technology Flex revenue decreased 0.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on a sequential basis. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in our Technology Flex business to remain stable to slightly up sequentially on a billing day basis and decline in the mid-single digits year over year on a billing day basis. 
 Our FA segment experienced a decrease in Flex revenue of 20.7 (21.9 on a billing day basis) and 23.9 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in the number of consultants on assignment. Our average bill rates improved by 2.7 and 3.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In the fourth quarter, we expect FA Flex revenue to decline in the low single digits sequentially on a billing day basis and in the mid 20 range year over year on a billing day basis. 
 The following table presents the key drivers for the change in Flex revenue by segment over the prior period (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 Key Drivers - Increase (Decrease) Technology FA Technology FA Volume - hours billed (12,337) (6,810) (77,868) (25,926) Bill rate 259 613 2,726 2,482 Billable expenses (57) 3 (265) 28 Total change in Flex revenue (12,135) (6,194) (75,407) (23,416)

 Direct Hire Revenue. The key drivers of Direct Hire revenue are the number of placements and the associated placement fee. Direct Hire revenue also includes conversion revenue, which may occur when a consultant initially assigned to a client on a temporary basis is later converted to a permanent placement for a fee.

Table of Contents 

 Direct Hire revenue decreased 16.4 and 26.4 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, which was primarily driven by a decrease in placements, partially offset by an increase in placement fee. 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit is calculated by deducting direct costs (primarily consultant compensation, payroll taxes, payroll-related insurance and certain fringe benefits, as well as third-party compliance costs) from total revenue. There are no consultant payroll costs associated with Direct Hire placements; accordingly, all Direct Hire revenue increases gross profit by the full amount of the placement fee. 
 The following table presents the gross profit percentage (gross profit as a percentage of total revenue) by segment and percentage change over the prior period: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2024 Increase (Decrease) 2023 Technology 26.9 1.9 26.4 26.6 (0.7) 26.8 FA 39.8 (1.5) 40.4 38.8 (1.0) 39.2 Total gross profit percentage 27.9 0.7 27.7 27.6 (1.4) 28.0 
 The total gross profit percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 20 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023 and was primarily driven by an increase in Technology Flex gross profit margins, which more than offset the lower mix of Direct Hire revenue. The total gross profit percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 40 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023 and was primarily due to a decline in the mix of Direct Hire revenue and Flex gross profit margins. 
 Flex gross profit percentage (Flex gross profit as a percentage of Flex revenue) provides management with helpful insights into the other drivers of total gross profit percentage driven by our Flex business, such as changes in the spread between the consultants bill rate and pay rate, changes in payroll tax rates or benefits costs, as well as the impact of billable expenses, which provide no profit margin. 
 The following table presents the Flex gross profit percentage by segment and percentage change over the prior period: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2024 Increase (Decrease) 2023 Technology 26.1 2.4 25.5 25.8 25.8 FA 29.4 (3.6) 30.5 29.4 (1.7) 29.9 Total Flex gross profit percentage 26.3 1.5 25.9 26.0 (0.4) 26.1 
 Our Flex gross profit percentage increased 40 and decreased 10 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Technology Flex gross profit margins increased 60 basis points and remained flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily driven by improvement in the spread between bill and pay rates and lower healthcare costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the impact from a tighter pricing environment was offset by lower healthcare costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect Technology Flex gross profit margins to decline sequentially due to the typical season impact of increases in vacation days taken by our consultants. 
 FA Flex gross profit margins decreased 110 and 50 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by a tighter pricing environment and a greater mix of lower margin projects, which was partially offset by lower healthcare costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect FA Flex gross profit margins to decline slightly due to seasonality.

 SG A Expenses . Total compensation, commissions, payroll taxes and benefit costs as a percentage of SG A expenses represented 84.5 and 84.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 83.8 and 84.6 for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. Commissions and bonus incentives are variable costs driven primarily by revenue and gross profit levels. Therefore, as those levels change, SG A expenses would also generally be anticipated to change. 
 The following table presents certain components of SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenue (in thousands): 2024 of Revenue 2023 of Revenue Three Months Ended September 30, Compensation, commissions, payroll taxes and benefits costs 66,188 18.7 72,232 19.4 Other (1)

 SG A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 90 basis points and remained flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 The decrease in SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 relates to costs in the prior period associated with our organizational realignment and actions taken to reduce our structural costs, and legal costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of the aforementioned items were offset by the degree of SG A deleverage for our compensation and related expenses as we aim to retain our most productive and tenured associates for an improved demand environment in the future. We are also investing in the enterprise priorities that we believe put our Firm in the best position to achieve our longer-term financial objectives. 
 We continue to prioritize investments in our strategic initiatives, including our integrated strategy, nearshore and offshore delivery capabilities and the implementation of Workday as part of our back-office transformation program. We are also continuing to exercise tight discretionary spend control and take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact of lower revenue and gross profit levels on our profitability. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. The following table presents depreciation and amortization expense and percentage change over the prior period by major category (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2024 Increase (Decrease) 2023 Fixed asset depreciation 802 (2.0) 818 2,421 3.6 2,336 Capitalized software amortization 741 93.0 384 2,010 39.6 1,440 Total Depreciation and amortization 1,543 28.4 1,202 4,431 17.3 3,776 
 Other Expense, Net. Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.4 million and 0.2 million, respectively. Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.6 million and 1.5 million, respectively. Other expense, net primarily includes interest expense related to outstanding borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Facility.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, this balance also included our proportionate share of losses related to our equity method investment of nil and 0.8 million, respectively. In February 2023, Kforce sold its 50 noncontrolling interest in our joint venture to an unaffiliated third party. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense as a percentage of income from operations, before income taxes (our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 25.1 and 28.9 , respectively. The primary driver for the decrease relates to a reduction in nondeductible executive compensation, the receipt of non-taxable proceeds from company-owned life insurance, and the recognition of research and development tax credits. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 R evenue Growth Rates. Revenue growth rates, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined by Kforce as revenue growth after removing the impacts on reported revenues from the changes in the number of billing days. Management believes this data is particularly useful because it aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The impact of billing days is calculated by dividing each comparative period s reported revenues by the number of billing days for the respective period to arrive at a per billing day amount for each quarter. Growth rates are then calculated using the per billing day amounts as a percentage change compared to the respective period. Management calculates the number of billing days for each reporting period based on the number of holidays and business days in the quarter.

 Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined by Kforce as net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, less capital expenditures. Management believes this provides an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows and is useful information to investors as it provides a measure of the amount of cash generated from the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, repurchasing common stock, paying dividends or making acquisitions. Free Cash Flow is limited, however, because it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, we believe it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a complement to (but not a replacement of) our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table presents Free Cash Flow (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 65,084 69,056 Capital expenditures (8,501) (6,076) Free cash flow 56,583 62,980 Change in debt (14,700) (4,200) Repurchases of common stock (21,189) (41,470) Cash dividends (21,282) (20,842) Proceeds from company-owned life insurance 2,377 Premiums paid for company-owned life insurance (1,777) (765) Proceeds from the sale of our joint venture interest 5,059 Note receivable issued to our joint venture (750) Other (4) (11) Change in cash and cash equivalents 8 1 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined by Kforce as net income before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense, net, income tax expense, organizational realignment activities, legal settlement expense and loss from equity method investment. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing our past and future financial performance, and this presentation should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to assess our operations including our ability to generate cash flows and our ability to repay our debt obligations and management believes it provides a good metric of our core profitability in comparing our performance to our competitors, as well as our performance over different time periods. Consequently, management believes it is useful information to investors. The measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows or other financial statement information presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. The measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations. Also, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 In addition, although we excluded stock-based compensation expense because it is a non-cash expense, we expect to continue to incur stock-based compensation expense in the future and the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our shareholder ownership interest. We suggest that you evaluate these items and the potential risks of excluding such items when analyzing our financial position.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 To meet our capital and liquidity requirements, we primarily rely on our operating cash flows and borrowings under our credit facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 26.9 million and 41.6 million outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Facility, respectively, and the borrowing availability was 172.1 million and 157.2 million, respectively, subject to certain covenants. At September 30, 2024, Kforce had 123.4 million in working capital compared to 141.5 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Cash Flows 
 We are principally focused on generating positive cash flows from operating activities, investing in our business to sustain our long-term growth and profitability objectives, and returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividends and common stock repurchase program. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 65.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 69.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our largest source of operating cash flows is the collection of trade receivables, and our largest use of operating cash flows is the payment of our associate and consultant compensation. The year-over-year decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower profitability levels and collections on trade receivables, partially offset by the timing of payments. 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.9 million and primarily consisted of cash used for capital expenditures of 8.5 million and premiums paid on company-owned life insurance of 1.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from company-owned life insurance of 2.4 million. 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.5 million and primarily consisted of cash used for capital expenditures of 6.1 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our joint venture interest of 5.1 million. 
 Cash used in f inancing activities was 57.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by net payments on our Credit Facility.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Kforce declared and paid quarterly dividends of 21.3 million 1.14 per share) and 20.9 million 1.08 per share), respectively, which represents a 6 increase on a per share basis. While the Firm s Board of Directors (the Board has declared and paid quarterly dividends since the fourth quarter of 2014, and intends to in the foreseeable future, dividends will be subject to determination by our Board each quarter following its review of, among other things, the Firm s current and expected financial performance as well as the ability to pay dividends under applicable law. 
 We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and available borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Facility will be adequate to meet the capital expenditure and working capital requirements of our operations for at least the next 12 months, and the foreseeable future, which we believe will provide us the flexibility to continue returning significant capital to our shareholders. However, a material deterioration in the macroeconomic environment or market conditions, among other things, could adversely affect operating results and liquidity, as well as the ability of our lenders to fund borrowings. Actual results could also differ materially from these indicated as a result of a number of factors, including the use of currently available resources for capital expenditures, investments, additional common stock repurchases or dividends. 
 Credit Facility 
 On October 20, 2021, the Firm entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, which has a maximum borrowing capacity of 200.0 million, and subject to certain conditions and the participation of the lenders, may be increased up to an aggregate additional amount of 150.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, 26.9 million was outstanding and 172.1 million was available on our Amended and Restated Credit Facility, and as of December 31, 2023, 41.6 million was outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants contained in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility as described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we currently expect that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 In February 2024, the Board approved an increase in our stock repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization to 100.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Kforce repurchased approximately 324 thousand shares of common stock on the open market at a total cost of approximately 20.3 million, and 79.7 million remained available for further repurchases under the Board-authorized common stock repurchase program at September 30, 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Other than the changes described below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes during the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q to our contractual obligations previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act (the Evaluation ), under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act Disclosure Controls ). Based on the Evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management has evaluated, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on the evaluation we conducted, management has concluded that no such changes have occurred. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 CEO and CFO Certifications

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 We are involved in legal proceedings, claims and administrative matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we have made accruals with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, that are reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements but are not, individually or in the aggregate, considered material. For other matters for which an accrual has not been made, we have not yet determined that a loss is probable, or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, but we do not expect that these proceedings and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements; however, if decided adversely to us, or if we determine that settlement of particular litigation is appropriate, we may be subject to additional liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Kforce maintains liability insurance that insures us against workers compensation, personal and bodily injury, property damage, directors and officers liability, errors and omissions, cyber liability, employment practices liability and fidelity losses. There can be no assurance that Kforce s liability insurance will cover all events or that the limits of coverage will be sufficient to fully cover all liabilities.
