SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or Quarterly Report, and the documents incorporated by reference herein, if any, contain forward-looking
statements that can involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in
this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, prospective
products, product approvals, research and development costs, future revenue, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of
management for future operations, future results of anticipated products and prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking
statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results,
performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
the forward-looking statements. 

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, 
 continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, 
 potential, predict, project, should, target, will, 
or would or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain
these words. Forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

the
 timing, progress and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future product candidates, including
 statements regarding the timing of initiation and completion of studies or trials and related preparatory work, the period during
 which the results of the trials will become available and our research and development programs; 

the
 timing, scope or likelihood of regulatory submissions, filings, and approvals, including final regulatory approval of our product
 candidates; 

our
 ability to develop and advance product candidates into, and successfully complete, clinical trials; 

our
 expectations regarding the size of the patient populations for our product candidates, if approved for commercial use; 

the
 implementation of our business model and our strategic plans for our business, product candidates and technology; 

our
 commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy; 

the
 pricing and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved; 

the
 rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our product candidates, in particular, and cell therapy, in general; 

our
 ability to establish or maintain collaborations or strategic relationships or obtain additional funding; 

2 

our
 competitive position; 

the
 scope of protection we and/or our licensors are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering our product
 candidates; 

developments
 and projections relating to our competitors and our industry; 

our
 estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

the
 period over which we estimate our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our future operating expenses and
 capital expenditure requirements; and 

the
 impact of laws and regulations. 

We
have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about our business, the industry in which
we operate and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and
these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or development. These forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the section
titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject
to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements
as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur
and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law,
we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein until after we distribute this Quarterly
Report, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise. 

In
addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and while we believe such information
forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to
indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements
are inherently uncertain, and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

thousand and cash and cash equivalents of thousand. A transition to profitability will depend on the successful
development, approval, and commercialization of product candidates and on the achievement of sufficient revenues to support the Company s
cost structure. The Company currently does not generate revenues and may never achieve profitability. Unless and until such time that
revenue and net income are generated, the Company will need to continue to raise additional capital. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. As further
described in Note 7, management has entered into a Share Purchase Agreement as of November 12, 2021. With the completion of the Company s
Direct Listing, this agreement provides the Company with access to additional liquidity. In February and March 2024, the Company utilized
this facility to raise a total of thousand, net of costs. In July through September 2024, the Company raised an additional 
thousand, and may utilize this facility to raise additional capital if needed. 

Segments 

Operating
segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation
by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The chief executive
officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources
and evaluating financial performance. The Company operates and manages its business as a single operating segment and therefore has 
reportable segment. 

reverse stock split. All share and per share amounts have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the effect of the reverse
stock split. 

. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company s financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

thousand and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. 

, and includes laboratory equipment that
is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of . Depreciation expense
is classified in either research and development expense or in general and administrative expense, depending upon the nature of the asset,
in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. When property and equipment assets are retired or otherwise disposed
of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in other
income (loss) in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. 

Property
and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable
market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that
would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used,
the Company will recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and
measure any impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. The Company incurred no such
losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Under
the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes , the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax
law all positions taken by the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides
that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The Company recognizes
interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expense line
in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. 

In
addition, the Company will utilize other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided to EGCs by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain
conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, an EGC is not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report
on the Company s system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
(ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-EGC public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding
mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the
financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), or (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation
between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee
compensation.

As
further described in Note 6, the Company issued shares of non-voting common stock on August 18, 2022. Because the issuance
of nonvoting common stock shares was treated as a stock split for accounting purposes, these shares are treated as having been issued
on January 1, 2022. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is based
upon the non-voting common stock shares issued on August 18, 2022. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 is based upon the non-voting common stock shares issued on August 18, 2022, the conversion of all
outstanding shares of non-voting common stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock into voting common stock upon
completion of the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, the issuance of shares of common stock issued to GEM Global Yield LLC SCS,
or GEM, in February through March 2024, and the issuance of shares of common stock to GEM in July through September 2024. 

As
further described in Note 7, the Company issued shares of common stock to GEM in September 2024 to facilitate a Draw Down Notice.
For accounting purposes, these shares are not considered issued as of September 30, 2024, because no proceeds were received for these
shares at issuance and the shares will either be purchased by GEM through a subsequent Closing Notice and payment or returned to the
Company, so these shares are contingently returnable. 

As
further described in Note 10, the Company agreed to pay to FibroGenesis of the gross proceeds from any equity investments in FibroBiologics
prior to an IPO, Direct Listing or Sale of the Company to eliminate upon the occurrence of such event the Series A Preferred Stock and
its million liquidation preference. This redemption of preferred stock created a derivative liability that exceeded the net Parent
Investment of thousand by thousand, and is reflected as a reduction of the amount available to common stockholders
in the calculation of earnings per share. 

The
Company had thousand of convertible notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022, which could have been converted into common stock
in the event that the Company sold and issued shares of capital stock in excess of thousand. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, and thousand, respectively, of the outstanding convertible notes were converted into shares of Series
B Preferred Stock. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported net losses and, accordingly, potential
common shares were not included since such inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. convertible notes were outstanding during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s basic and diluted net losses per share are the same
because it generated a net loss in all periods presented.

The

and was thousand and thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

thousand of the 2022 Notes had been converted, which eliminated thousand of the derivative
liability. 

As
of December 31, 2023, the Company measured its liability instrument to investors under the Share Purchase Agreement, as further described
in Note 7, at thousand. This liability instrument was comprised of a warrant liability and a forward contract liability, both of which
were contingent upon an IPO event, and is classified within Level 3 of the value hierarchy because the liability was based upon a valuation
model that used inputs and assumptions including potential outcomes, interest rates, probabilities, and timing. The Company completed
its Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, which qualified as an IPO event, and bifurcated the liability instrument into its separate Warrant
liability and Forward contract liability components. The fair value of the Warrant liability to be issued upon completion of the Direct Listing
on January 31, 2024 was thousand, and this fair value decreased to thousand at September 30, 2024. The fair value of the
Forward contract liability was de minimis at January 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024.

As
of December 31, 2023, the liability instrument included the contingent warrant liability and the contingent put option (forward contract)
liability as a single unit of account. The liability instrument value was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model and management s
assumption of a 50 likelihood as of December 31, 2023, of becoming a public company prior to the expiration of the Stock Purchase Agreement.
Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included an estimated number of warrants, an assumed common stock share price of 
per share, the five -year time to maturity, a dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of for the five -year time to
maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of based on comparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices. 

Upon
completion of the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, the warrant liability and the forward contract liability were no longer contingent
and were bifurcated out of the liability instrument and treated as separate units of account. As of January 31, 2024, the warrant liability
value for the warrant issued to GEM Yield Bahamas Limited GYBL was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included the warrants issued to GYBL, the closing bid price of per
share on January 31, 2024, the five -year time to maturity, a dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of for the five -year
time to maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of based on comparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices.
As of September 30, 2024, the warrant liability value for the warrant issued to GYBL was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included the warrants issued to GYBL, the closing bid price of per share
on September 30, 2024, the four -year time to maturity, a dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of for the five-year
time to maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of based on comparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices. 

As
further described in Note 7, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice on September 12, 2024, for shares. On September 26, 2024,
an initial Closing Notice was provided by GEM to purchase shares and the remainder of the Draw Down Notice remained open. The
fair value of the remaining forward contract liability was remeasured at September 30, 2024, based upon the remaining shares,
a price per share of , based on the floor price of per share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on September
30, 2024, and the discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. 

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and Parent
company payable and receivable approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities.

were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

and , respectively, preferred
stock shares. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had issued Series A Preferred Stock shares to FibroGenesis, which were tendered
pursuant to the formation of the Company in exchange for the contribution of certain in-process research and development and patent assets
through Patent Assignment and Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. The Series A Preferred Stock shares had the right to vote
and ranked prior to non-voting common stock and common stock with respect to payment of dividends and distributions and upon liquidation,
dissolution, winding-up or otherwise. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference equal to 
thousand to be allocated among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shares in the event of a liquidation, dissolution,
or winding-up of the Company, which was subsequently eliminated as part of the ROFN Agreement as further described below, and each share
of Series A Preferred Stock could be converted into one share of common stock at any time at the election of the holder
of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Unless otherwise elected by the holder(s), a merger or consolidation in which
the Company is not the majority surviving entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation would be a
deemed liquidation event. The Company has also authorized shares of non-voting common stock, and has issued during the year
ended December 31, 2022, a total of shares. In August 2022, the Company issued shares of non-voting common stock
to its Parent, which in turn distributed the shares to its members. This issuance of non-voting common stock was accounted for as stock
split and no proceeds were received by the Company. The Company also issued to its board of directors, a consultant, and an employee
an additional total shares in 2022 and recorded thousand of expense for the issuance of these shares, which was based upon
a third-party valuation of the shares at the time of issuance. 

In
December 2022, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize shares of Series B Preferred
Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference after Series A Preferred Stock and prior
to Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock had voting rights and would automatically convert
into Common Stock upon closing of an IPO transaction, as defined in the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 

In
January 2023, to reflect the ROFN Agreement with its Parent, as further discussed in Note 10, the Company amended its Certificate of
Incorporation to a) make the Series B Preferred Stock liquidation preference equal to Series A Preferred
Stock, and b) to provide that upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company, the Series A Preferred Stock would be canceled
for no consideration. 

In
March 2023, the Company accepted a stock subscription to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock for thousand and recorded
a stock subscription payable for the full amount of the thousand of proceeds received in March 2023. The stock subscription payable
as of March 31, 2023, was subsequently eliminated in April 2023 when the Company issued the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the
shareholder. 

In
April 2023, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize shares of Common Stock, increase the number
of authorized Series B Preferred Stock shares up to shares, and to authorize shares of Series B-1 
Preferred Stock with liquidation preference equal to the Series A and B Preferred Stock. The Series B-1 
Preferred Stock had voting rights and would automatically convert into Common Stock upon closing of an IPO transaction, as defined in
the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 

In
October 2023, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to increase to 
shares its authorized shares of voting common stock, par value per share, reduce to shares its authorized shares
of non-voting common stock, par value per share, and authorize shares of Series C Preferred Stock, par value 
per share. The Series C Preferred Stock ranked senior to common stock and non-voting common stock and junior to the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise. . per share, subject to adjustment, may be converted 1:1 at any time at the option
of the holder into common stock, and upon closing of an IPO, would, if transferred, automatically convert 1:1 into common stock . 

In
January 2024, the Company issued shares of Series C Preferred Stock to its CEO, who in turn granted a proxy to the Board of Directors
to vote these shares as outlined in the amended and restated certification of incorporation. 

On
January 31, 2024, the Company completed its Direct Listing, which qualified as an IPO transaction. As a result of the IPO, the outstanding
Series A Preferred Stock shares were canceled for no consideration and the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, and non-voting common stock shares were all converted 1:1 into shares of voting common stock. In addition, and, if transferred, these . 

In
August 2024, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to eliminate its non-voting
common stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, and to reduce to shares
its authorized preferred stock, par value per share, of which shares are designated as Series C Preferred Stock. 

thousand
of common stock (the Aggregate Limit ). This agreement was contingent upon the Company achieving a public listing of its
common stock. Major terms of the agreement include a commitment fee of of the Aggregate Limit, which is due no later than one year
after public listing even if no drawdowns are taken, and five-year warrants issued to the investors at the time of public listing to
purchase common stock equal to 4 of the total equity interests of the Company at the lesser of a) the price per share at the time of
the public listing or b) the quotient of thousand divided by the total number of equity interests (fully diluted common shares).

After
completion of its public listing on January 31, 2024, and during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold a total of 
shares of common stock for thousand of net proceeds through the Share Purchase Agreement. 

Upon
completion of its public listing the Company recorded a payable of thousand for the commitment fee obligation due under the Share
Purchase Agreement within one year, and expensed the thousand remaining amount of the commitment fee at March 31, 2024. 

On
June 27, 2024, the Company issued shares
of Common Stock to facilitate a Draw Down Notice under the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company recorded upon issuance a thousand
fair value of the forward contract liability for its requirement to sell up to shares
to the investor at 
of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down Period based upon the number of shares, the closing price per share of
 on
June 27, 2024, and the 
discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. The fair value of the forward contract liability was
remeasured to thousand at July 11, 2024, upon receipt of the Closing Notice from GEM, based upon the shares
accepted, the . closing price per share, and a net purchase price per share of after
the 
discount provided to the investor, and the forward contract liability was eliminated. GEM returned shares
to the Company, which canceled those shares, and the remaining shares
were retained by GEM to facilitate a subsequent Draw Down Notice. 

On
July 12, 2024, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice for 
 shares. The Company recorded upon issuance a
 thousand
fair value of the forward contract liability for its requirement to sell up to 
 shares to the investor at 
of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down Period based upon the number of shares, the closing price per share of 
 on July 12, 2024, and the 
discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. The fair value of the forward contract liability was
remeasured to a thousand asset at August 26, 2024, upon receipt
of the Closing Notice from GEM, based upon the 
 shares accepted, the closing price per
share, and a net price per share of 
 after the 
discount provided to the investor, and the forward contract liability was eliminated. GEM returned 
 shares to the Company, which canceled those shares,
and the remaining 
 shares were retained by GEM to facilitate a subsequent
Draw Down Notice. 

On
September 12, 2024, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice for shares.
The Company recorded upon issuance a thousand
fair value of the forward contract liability for its requirement to sell up to shares
to the investor at 
of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down Period based upon the number of shares, a price per share of ,
based on the floor price of per
share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on September 12, 2024, and the 
discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. Upon receipt of an initial Closing Notice from GEM
on September 26, 2024, the fair value of the portion of the forward contract liability covered by the Closing Notice was remeasured
to thousand
at, based upon the shares
accepted, the price per
share, and a net price per share of after
the 
discount provided to the investor, and that portion of the forward contract liability was eliminated. The September 12, 2024, Draw
Down Notice remained open for shares,
which will either be sold to GEM pursuant to a future Closing Notice or returned to the Company. The fair value of the of the
remaining portion of the forward contract liability was remeasured at September 30, 2024, based on the remaining shares, a
price per share of , based on the floor price of per share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on
September 30, 2024, and the discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. 

In
October 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for office space with a term of months, which expires on November 30, 2027.
This lease is accounted for as an operating lease under the ASC 842 guidance for lease accounting. A right-of-use lease asset and lease
liability of thousand each were recorded at inception of the lease term using a discount rate of . 

In
June 2023, the Company entered into a new lease for temporary lab and office space for its research operations. This lease has a term
of months and monthly rent of thousand and is accounted for as a short-term lease. This lease commenced in August 2023. In September
2023, the Company entered into an amendment of this lease for additional space, and the monthly rent increased to thousand. In March
2024, the Company entered into a second amendment of this lease for additional space, and effective April 1, 2024, the monthly rent increased
to thousand. In July 2024, the Company signed an amendment of this lease, effective August 1, 2024, to extend the term for an additional

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included in
Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included as
part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing fibroblast-based therapies for patients suffering
from chronic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including wound healing, multiple sclerosis (MS), degenerative disc disease,
psoriasis and certain cancers, and potential human longevity applications including thymic involution reversal. At present,
our novel manufacturing process entails collecting excess tissue from surgical procedures and using the allogeneic fibroblasts to grow
a cell bank for use in our procedures. Our most advanced product candidates are CYWC628, CYMS101 and CybroCell . 

We
are in the late pre-clinical stages of developing CYWC628 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for wound healing. Our studies
are presently focused on utilizing fibroblasts and fibroblast-derived cells to treat wounds in diabetic mice. The results of our studies
to date have shown statistically significant acceleration in the rate of wound closure in comparison with both a marketed wound care
product and control, and improved quality of healed wounds. Based upon our results achieved to date and the expected timing of our remaining
preclinical studies, we are planning to initiate a twelve-week Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Australia for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers
in the second quarter of 2025 as funding allows. 

We
are developing CYMS101 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy to treat MS. After completing animal studies using CYMS101, we
received approval to conduct clinical investigations in Mexico using the fibroblast cell composition for patients with MS and have completed
a Phase 1 study. The study was conducted in five participants. The primary objective of the study was to assess safety, and the secondary
objective was to assess efficacy. The primary objective was achieved as we saw no adverse events related
to the treatment. We are currently conducting further research to determine the mode of action of fibroblasts in oligodendrocyte
expansion and expect to file an IND application for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in MS as funding allows. We will likely seek a strategic
partner to collaborate with us on the development of CYMS101 either before initiating the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, or after its completion,
if successful, and prior to commencing with a Phase 3 clinical trial. 

CybroCell 
is an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for degenerative disc disease and is being designed as an alternative method for repairing
the cartilage of the intervertebral disc (or any other articular cartilage). We have completed two animal studies. The results from the
studies were positive and resulted in first in human trial approval. We have received IND clearance from the FDA, conditional
upon approval of our master cell bank, to run a Phase 1 study for patients suffering from degenerative disc disease and will be conducting
this study within the United States. A timeline will be determined through discussions with the FDA and as funding allows. 

CYPS317
is our allogeneic intravenously administered fibroblast cell-based therapeutic for the treatment of psoriasis. We are moving this
early phase project to our product candidate pipeline. Our early pre-clinical animal model studies have demonstrated significant
efficacy in the treatment of mild and severe psoriasis. Our studies have also demonstrated improved efficacy as compared to anti
IL-23 monoclonal antibody, with no adverse effects noted with the respiratory, circulatory, hepatic and renal organ systems. We are
currently in the process of continuing our IND-enabling animal model studies, with a projected completion timeline of the fourth
quarter of 2025. 

We
also have human longevity, cancer, and artificial pancreatic organoid programs in the early stages of development, and we plan to accelerate such programs
as funding allows. 

We
currently utilize a CDMO to manufacture our cell therapy product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we
will evaluate the longer-term feasibility of building our own cGMP manufacturing facility or continuing to outsource production to a
CDMO for clinical testing and commercial sales. 

Since
our spinoff from FibroGenesis in April 2021, our operations have included business planning, hiring personnel, raising capital, building
our intellectual property portfolio, and performing research and development on our product candidates and our fibroblast technology,
leveraging the clinical benefits of fibroblasts as the basis of our cell therapy platform. 

We
have incurred net losses since Inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities.
To date, we have funded our operations primarily through investment from FibroGenesis, the issuance of 5.6 million of our convertible
promissory notes from December 2021 through April 2022, the issuance of 18.6 million of preferred stock, and the issuance of 8.0 million
of common stock. 

20 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 7.8 million. Since our Inception, we have incurred significant
operating losses. We incurred net losses of approximately 8.1 million and 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 32.4 million. We expect to continue
to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years. See Funding Requirements below. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase substantially if and
as we: 

advance
 the development of our lead product candidates through clinical development, and, if approved by the FDA, commercialization; 

advance
 our preclinical development programs into clinical development; 

incur
 manufacturing costs for cell production to supply our product candidates; 

seek
 regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

increase
 our research and development activities to identify and develop new product candidates; 

hire
 additional personnel; 

expand
 our operational, financial and management systems; 

meet
 the requirements and demands of being a public company; 

invest
 in further development to protect and expand our intellectual property; 

establish
 a sales, marketing, medical affairs, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain
 marketing approval and intend to commercialize; and 

expand
 our manufacturing and develop our commercialization efforts. 

Due
to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development and the economic and developmental uncertainty,
we may be unable to accurately predict the timing or magnitude of all expenses. Our ability to ultimately generate revenue to achieve
profitability will depend heavily on the development, approval, and subsequent commercialization of our product candidates. If we fail
to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at
planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 

As
a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our long-term continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy.
Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale
of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions.
We may not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at
all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we will have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate
the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. 

General
Trends and Outlook 

Recent
Developments 

CYWC628 

We
completed pre-clinical studies investigating (i) multiple administrations of CYWC628 on a chemically induced chronic wound NONcNZO10/LtJ
mouse model, (ii) dose titration to provide information on the effective dose range of CYWC628, and (iii) acute and chronic toxicity.
We expect to complete our remaining pre-clinical studies by the end of 2024. 

As
part of the preparation for a Phase I/II clinical trial of CYWC628 for the potential treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), we entered
into a master service agreement with a CDMO that will govern the production of our master cell bank, working cell bank, and our CYWC628
drug product candidate. We also entered into a master service agreement with a CRO that will carry out the Phase I/II clinical trial
of CYWC628 for the potential treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in Australia in 2025. 

Psoriasis 

We
have completed an early phase project utilizing a psoriasis mouse model to assess the potential use of intravenous administration of
fibroblast spheroids for the treatment of psoriasis. Results to date include that a single administration of fibroblast spheroids
resulted in significant improvement in mice with moderate psoriasis, and that multiple administrations of fibroblast spheroids
resulted in significant improvement in mice with severe psoriasis. We also compared fibroblast spheroid with single and multiple
administration of an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody in treatment of mice with mild to moderate psoriasis. We noted that a single
treatment of fibroblast spheroids was significantly better than single and multiple administration of an anti-IL-23 monoclonal
antibody. We are in the process of carrying out a dosage titration animal model study to determine optimal efficacious dose range,
in addition to determining the durability of treatment for mild to moderate, and moderate to severe psoriasis. Three anti-IL-23
monoclonal antibody treatments are approved by the FDA for the treatment of psoriasis, including Tremfya , Illumya , and
Skyrizi . As a result of these studies, we have moved this project to our product candidate pipeline with the name of CYPS317. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
have filed two new patent applications with the United States Patent Office. The first patent application covers the use of fibroblast
cell-based technology in an adhesive bandage for wound healing. The second patent application covers the use of fibroblast cell-based
technology in generating three-dimensional hemopoietic organoids that can give rise to functional immune cells.

Components
of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

To
date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the
foreseeable future. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we
may generate revenue in the future from product sales. We cannot predict if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the
commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product
candidates. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Our
research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates and include: 

employee-related
 expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation for our research and development personnel; 

laboratory
 equipment and supplies; 

direct
 third-party costs such as expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and CDMOs; 

consultants
 that conduct research and development activities on our behalf; 

costs
 associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

costs
 associated with technology; and 

facilities
 and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and other facility related costs and other supplies. 

We
expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received
in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the
related goods are delivered or the services are performed. 

We
expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research
and development activities related to developing our product candidates as they advance into later stages of clinical development and
our other product candidates in preclinical development as they advance into clinical development. The process of conducting the necessary
clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates
is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects
or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. This is due
to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including uncertainty related to: 

the
 duration, costs and timing of clinical trials for our current development programs and any further clinical trials related to new
 product candidates; 

the
 sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

the
 acceptance of IND applications for future clinical trials; 

the
 successful and timely enrollment and completion of clinical trials; 

the
 successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

successful
 data from our clinical program that supports an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; 

the
 receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing
 agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if any of our
 product candidates are approved; 

the
 entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates; 

obtaining
 and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and 

successfully
 launching our product candidates and achieving commercial sales, if and when approved. 

22 

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our programs or any product candidate we develop
would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development and/or regulatory approval of such programs
or product candidates. 

General,
Administrative and Other Expenses 

Our
general, administrative, and other expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities costs, and other expenses for
outside professional services, including legal, marketing, investor relations, human resources services, and accounting services. Personnel
costs consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our general and administrative personnel. We will continue to incur
additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations
of the SEC, Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.
We also expect to increase the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business. 

Interest
Expense 

Our
interest expense consists primarily of accrued interest expense and amortization of discount on our convertible notes.

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses were 1.2 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
increase of 0.6 million was primarily due to: 

increased
 tissue acquisition and CDMO costs of 0.3 million for cell manufacturing activities; 

increased
 personnel related expenses of 0.2 million due to hiring additional research scientists after September 30, 2023; and 

increased
 research materials and supplies expenses of 0.1 million due to increased laboratory personnel and preclinical studies. 

Research
and development expenses were 3.1 million and 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
increase of 1.5 million was primarily due to: 

increased
 personnel related expenses of 0.6 million due to hiring additional research scientists after September 30, 2023; 

increased
 tissue acquisition and CDMO costs of 0.5 million for cell manufacturing activities; and 

increased
 research materials and supplies, conferences, and depreciation expenses of 0.4 million due to increased laboratory personnel and
 preclinical studies. 

Research
and development expenses are not tracked by product candidate. 

General,
Administrative and Other Expenses 

General,
administrative and other expenses were 2.1 million and 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The increase of 0.6 million was primarily due to: 

increased
 expense of 0.2 million for public company D O insurance; 

increased
 expenses of 0.2 million for patent filing and maintenance costs; 

increased
 expenses of 0.2 million for added personnel in 2024; 

increased
 expenses of 0.1 million for investor relations and marketing costs, and. 

decreased
 expenses of 0.1 million for legal fees. 

General,
administrative and other expenses were 6.9 million and 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The increase of 2.1 million was primarily due to: 

increased
 expenses of 0.7 million for regulatory, listing, accounting, investor relations and marketing expenses related to our Direct Listing
 completed in January 2024 and subsequent financing efforts; 

increased
 expenses of 0.7 million for added personnel in 2024; 

increased
 expenses of 0.5 million for patent filing and maintenance costs; 

increased
 expense of 0.5 million for public company D O insurance; 

decreased
 expenses of 0.3 million due to timing of an executive bonus in January 2023. 

Change
in fair value of warrant liability 

Change
in fair value of warrant liability was a gain of 1.9 million and none for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The liability instrument to investors under the Share Purchase Agreement among us, GEM Global Yield
LLC SCS, or GEM, and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited, or GYBL, dated November 12, 2021, or the GEM SPA, was comprised of the contingent warrant
liability and contingent put option. The 1.9 million gain during the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from the mark to
market of the warrant liability, which will occur at the end of each reporting period as long as the warrants are outstanding and classified
as a liability. 

Change
in fair value of warrant liability was a gain of 4.3 million and none for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. This change in fair value resulted primarily from the decrease in our stock price. 

Change
in fair value of forward contract liability 

Change
in fair value of forward contract liability was a net gain of 0.8 million and 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. A forward contract liability to sell shares to the investor at 90 of the average daily closing price per share over
the Draw Down Pricing Period is recorded each time we issue a Draw Down Notice to GEM under the Share Purchase Agreement. The forward
contract liability is remeasured at the end of each quarter, if open, and again upon receipt of the Closing Notice from the investor.
The forward contract liability is eliminated upon receipt of the Closing Notice and funds from the investor. 

Change
in fair value of forward contract liability was a net loss of 0.7 million and 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. 

Commitment
fee expense 

Commitment
fee expense was 1.9 million and none for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A 2 million commitment fee
pursuant to the GEM SPA became payable to GEM upon completion of the Direct Listing in January 2024. The commitment fee is payable to
GEM as drawdown notices are issued, with any remaining balance payable one year after public listing. We sold 3.0 million of common
stock to GEM under the GEM SPA during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which made approximately 0.1 million of the commitment
fee payable immediately. This 0.1 million portion of the commitment fee was netted against the proceeds received in additional paid-in
capital. The remaining 1.9 million was expensed immediately because we were planning to raise funds through other sources and had no
plans to issue further Draw Down Notices to GEM prior to the one-year anniversary of our public listing when this remaining amount will
be due. 

Other
loss 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, of other loss is comprised of the
payments to FibroGenesis in excess of the derivative liability established at inception of the Agreement Regarding Right of First Negotiation
entered into by us and FibroGenesis in January 2023, or the ROFN Agreement. 

Interest
income 

Interest
income is comprised of interest income and unrealized gain/losses on cash equivalents. 

24 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense was 0.0 million and 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.1 million
was due to the maturities and conversions of the notes during the year ended December 31, 2023. Interest expense was recorded in 2023
for the nominal interest rate of 6.0 plus the amortization of the discount on the 2022 convertible notes. 

Income
Taxes 

The
effective income tax rate was 0.0 for all periods. Currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax
assets. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

To
date, we have financed our operations primarily with investment from FibroGenesis, proceeds from borrowings under our convertible loan
agreements, and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and common stock. From Inception through September 30, 2024, we have received
gross proceeds of approximately 5.6 million from sales of our convertible notes, 18.6 million from the issuance of preferred stock,
and 8.0 million from the issuance of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 7.8
million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 32.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding debt. 

Cash
Flows 

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 8.8 million and 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, and consisted primarily of net losses of 8.1 million and 6.8 million, respectively. Noncash losses on stock-based
compensation expense of 1.7 million and change in fair value of forward contract liability of 0.7 million, and amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of 0.3 million, and change in
commitment fee payable of 1.9 million partially offset the net loss, while noncash gain on change in fair value of liability
instrument of 4.3 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of 0.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of
 0.3 million, a decrease in payable to Parent of 0.1 million, and a decrease in operating lease liability of 0.3 million added to
the cash used in operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Noncash expenses of stock-based compensation of 1.3
million, other loss on derivative liability of 0.1 million, amortization of convertible notes debt discount of 0.1 million, and
amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of 0.3 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 0.4
million and an increase in payable to Parent of 0.1 million partially offset the net loss, while a decrease in operating lease
liability of 0.3 million added to the cash used in operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately 0.1 million and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, and consist primarily of laboratory equipment purchases. 

25 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately 7.6 million and 13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a 0.6 million short-term borrowing agreement to
finance the D O insurance policy premiums and repaid 0.5 million of the principal borrowed, and we raised 7.5 million of net proceeds
from the sale of common stock under the GEM SPA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid to FibroGenesis 2.6 million
under the ROFN Agreement, we received 0.3 million from FibroGenesis repayment of its note payable to us, and we received 15.2
million in total net proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock. 

Funding
Requirements 

We
do not have any products approved for sale, and we have never generated any revenue from contracts with customers. We do not expect to
generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our current or future product
candidates and we do not know when, or if, that will occur. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future,
and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our current and future product
candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all the risks typically related to the development of
new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that
may adversely affect our business. Moreover, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. 

The
financial statements have been prepared as though we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations
since Inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 32.4 million. Management expects to continue
to incur operating losses and negative cash flows. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital. We will need to raise
additional capital to continue to fund our operations. We believe we will be able to obtain additional capital through equity financings
or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, if available, can be obtained
on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. 

Our
future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

the
 initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of our clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the
 initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of additional research and preclinical studies related to pipeline development and
 other research programs we initiate in the future; 

the
 cost and timing of manufacturing activities, including our planned manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product
 candidates and other programs as we advance them through preclinical and clinical development through commercialization; 

the
 potential expansion of our current development programs to seek new indications; 

the
 outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

the
 cost of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, in-licensed or otherwise; 

26 

the
 effect of competing technological and market developments; 

the
 payment of licensing fees, potential royalty payments and potential milestone payments; 

the
 cost of general operating expenses; 

the
 cost of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory
 approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own; and 

the
 costs of operating as a public company. 

Further,
our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials
and other research and development expenditures. 

If
we need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we
are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our preclinical
studies, clinical trials, research and development programs or commercialization efforts. We may seek to raise any necessary additional
capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and other licensing arrangements.
If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific
actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through
marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we
may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or
grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

Material
contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of operating leases. Future minimum lease payments
under non-cancellable leases as of September 30, 2024, were approximately 1.6 million, of which 0.5 million is due within one year.
We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by financing activities. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our
estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. 

We
define our critical accounting estimates as those under GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters
that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific
manner in which we apply those principles. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please see the disclosures
in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a Forward contract liability with each Draw Down
Notice issued to GEM and have remeasured this Forward contract liability at each quarter end and upon receipt of each Closing Notice from
GEM. Other than the Forward contract liability critical accounting estimates and changes in the fair value of the Warrant liability, as
described in this Quarterly Report, there have not been any material changes to
our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and
are not required to provide the information specified under this item. 

27 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation, of management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) of the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. During the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to a
lack of segregation of duties. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Specifically,
our management identified a material weakness in our internal controls within the financial reporting function that resulted from an
ineffective design and implementation of controls over proper segregation of duties for the period of time covered by our financial statements
due to a limited number of individuals. Based upon such evaluation, and due to the material weakness identified, our principal executive
officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Remediation
Plan for Material Weakness 

We
will continue to add staff, evaluate segregation of duties, and implement initiatives to improve our internal controls over financial
reporting as we grow. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that
occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues, if any, within an organization have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures and our
internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. We continue to implement, improve, and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial
reporting. 

28 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings relating to intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters arising
in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings
will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We are not party to
any legal proceedings at this time. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Our
business is subject to risks, uncertainties, and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations and the trading price of our securities. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors
previously described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 

Risks
Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements 

There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report, our management concluded that there is substantial doubt as to whether we can
continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of this Quarterly Report. Our ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon raising capital to maintain current operations and continue research and development efforts. We plan to raise
additional capital to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and/or potential collaborations
and license arrangements or other sources. There is no assurance, however, that any additional financing or any revenue-generating collaboration
will be available when needed or that we will be able to obtain financing or enter into a collaboration on terms acceptable to us. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock, and it may be more difficult for us to obtain
financing. If existing or potential collaborators decline to do business with us or potential investors decline to participate in any
future financings due to such concerns, our ability to increase our cash position may be limited. The perception that we may not be able
to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual
obligations. We have prepared our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are
unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we will be forced to delay, reduce or discontinue
our research and development programs or consider other various strategic alternatives and you could lose all or part of your investment
in us.
