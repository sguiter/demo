 million (gross real estate properties less gross real estate intangibles liabilities) in real estate properties. In addition, the Company provides commercial real estate brokerage services for its own portfolio and third-party office, industrial and retail operators and tenants. The Company is structured as an Up-C corporation with substantially all of its operations conducted through Broad Street Operating Partnership, LP (the Operating Partnership and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned of the Class A common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership Common OP units and Series A preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership Preferred OP units and, together with the Common OP units, OP units and is the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Company began operating in its current structure on December 27, 2019, upon the completion of the Initial Mergers (as defined below) and operates as a single reporting segment. Liquidity, Management s Plan and Going Concern The Company s rental revenue and operating results depend significantly on the occupancy levels at its properties and the ability of its tenants to meet their rent and other obligations to the Company. The Company s projected operating model reflects sufficient cash flow to cover its obligations over the next twelve months, except as noted below. The Company s financing is generally comprised of mortgage loans secured by the Company s properties that typically mature within three to of origination. The Company is currently in contact with lenders and brokers in the marketplace to rest ructure the Company s debt. Specifically, as of September 30, 2024 , the Company had mortgage loans with a combined principal balance outstanding of approximately million that mature within twelve months of the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. On October 28, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to extend the maturity date of one of the mortgage loans to March 1, 2025. The Company is seeking to refinance these loans prior to maturity in January 2025, March 2025 and June 2025. Management is in discussions with the current lenders as well as various other lenders to extend or refinance these three mortgage loans prior to maturity. Although the Company has a history of demonstrating its ability to successfully refinance its loans as they come due, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in its efforts to refinance the loans on favorable terms or at all. While it is not the Company's current plan, the Company also has the option to sell properties securing the loans and use the proceeds to satisfy the outstanding loan obligations. If the Company is ultimately unable to repay or refinance these loans or sell the properties prior to maturity, the lender has the right to place the loans in default and ultimately foreclose on the properties securing the loans. Under this circumstance, the Company would not have any further financial obligations to the lenders as the current estimated market values of these properties are in excess of the outstanding loan balances. The Company's access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which the Company has little or no control, including general market conditions, the market's perception of the Company's current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, the Company's current debt levels and the market price of the shares of the Company's common stock. Although the Company's common stock is quoted on the OTCQX Best Market, an over-the-counter stock market, there is a very limited trading market for the Company's common stock, and if a more active trading market is not developed and sustained, the Company will be limited in its ability to issue equity to fund its capital needs. If the Company cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, the Company may not be able to meet the capital and operating needs of its properties, satisfy its debt service obligations or pay dividends to its stockholders. Under the Company's debt agreements, the Company is subject to certain covenants. In the event of a default, the lenders could accelerate the timing of payments under the applicable debt obligations and the Company may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under its debt agreements as of September 30, 2024 .

If, however, the maximum amount of the award is not earned as of December 31, 2024, the remaining RSUs may be earned based on the Company s Implied Equity Market Capitalization as of December 31, 2025. To the extent performance is between any two designated amounts, the percentage of the target award earned will be determined using a straight-line linear interpolation between the two designated amounts. The value of the awards is determined by using a Monte Carlo simulation model in estimating the market value of the RSUs as of the date of grant. The Company expenses the cost of RSUs ratably over the vesting period. On February 28, 2023, RSUs were forfeited as a result of an employee s resignation.

The derivative financial instruments are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. The market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument s term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant inputs to the derivative valuation model for interest rate caps and interest rate swaps are observable in active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. See Note 8 Interest Rate Cap and Interest Rate Swap Agreements for further discussion regarding the Company s interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements. The Preferred Equity Investment contains embedded features that are required to be bifurcated from the temporary equity-host and recognized as separate derivative liabilities subject to initial and subsequent periodic estimated fair value measurements under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability was valued using a binomial lattice-based model which takes into account variables such as estimated volatility, expected holding period, stock price, the exit fee and the risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is the five-year treasury rate at the valuation date. This technique incorporates Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. The Company elected to measure the Fortress Mezzanine Loan at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The Fortress Mezzanine Loan is a debt host financial instrument containing embedded features which would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from the debt-host and recognized as separate derivative liabilities subject to initial and subsequent periodic estimated fair value measurements under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The fair value option election for the Fortress Mezzanine Loan is due to the number and complexity of features that would require separate bifurcation absent this election. The fair value of the Fortress Mezzanine Loan is valued using a binomial lattice-based model which takes into account variables such as estimated volatility, expected holding period, stock price, the exit fee and the risk-free interest rate.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables and payables are reasonable estimates of their fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 due to the short-term nature of these instruments (Level 1). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s indebtedness was comprised of borrowings that bear interest at variable and fixed rates. The fair value of the Company s borrowings under variable rates at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximate their carrying values as the debt is at variable rates currently available and resets on a monthly basis. The fair value of the Company s fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is estimated by using Level 2 inputs such as discounting the estimated future cash flows using current market rates for similar loans that would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. Settlement at such fair value amounts may not be possible.

Overview 
 We are focused on owning and managing essential grocery-anchored and mixed-use assets located in densely populated technology employment hubs and higher education centers within the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Colorado markets. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 15 properties. The properties in our portfolio are dispersed in sub-markets that we believe generally have high population densities, high traffic counts, good visibility and accessibility, which provide our tenants with attractive locations to serve the necessity-based needs of the surrounding communities. We intend to focus on acquiring additional strategically positioned properties in established and developing neighborhoods primarily leased to necessity-based tenants that meet the needs of the surrounding communities in our existing markets, as well as acquiring properties in new markets that meet our investment criteria, including the Southeastern United States. In addition, we provide commercial real estate brokerage services for our own portfolio and third-party office, industrial and retail operators and tenants. 
 The table below provides certain information regarding our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For additional information, see Our Portfolio.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Refer to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies of revenue recognition, real estate investments, asset impairment, income taxes, and our accounting policy on consolidation, which are included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to these policies. See Note 2 Accounting Guidance to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this report for recently-adopted accounting pronouncements. 
 Factors that May Impact Future Results of Operations 
 Rental Income 
 Growth in rental income will depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria and on filling vacancies and increasing rents on the properties in our portfolio. The amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on our ability to renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon the scheduled or unscheduled termination of leases, lease currently available space and maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. Our rental income in future periods could be adversely affected by local, regional, or national economic conditions, an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for retail space, changes in market rental rates, our ability to provide adequate services and maintenance at our properties, fluctuations in interest rates and dispositions of properties. In addition, economic downturns affecting our markets or downturns in our tenants businesses that impair our ability to renew or re-lease space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments to us could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rent and occupancy. 
 Scheduled Lease Expirations 
 Our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or greater than that of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. Our properties are marketed to smaller tenants that generally desire shorter-term leases. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 44.8 of our portfolio (based on GLA) was leased to tenants occupying less than 10,000 square feet. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 11.1 of our GLA was vacant and approximately 0.2 of our leases (based on GLA) were scheduled to expire on or before December 31, 2024. Although we maintain ongoing dialogue with our tenants, we generally raise the issue of renewal at least 12 months prior to lease renewal often providing concessions for early renewal. If our current tenants do not renew their leases or terminate their leases early, we may be unable to re-lease the space to new tenants on favorable terms or at all. Our vacancy trends will be impacted by new properties that we acquire, which may include properties with higher vacancy where we identified opportunities to increase occupancy. 
 29 

Acquisitions 
 Over the long-term, we intend to grow our portfolio through the acquisition of additional strategically positioned properties in established and developing neighborhoods primarily leased to necessity-based tenants that meet the needs of the surrounding communities in our existing markets, as well as acquiring properties in new markets that meet our investment criteria, including the Southeastern United States. We have established relationships with a wide variety of market participants, including tenants, leasing agents, investment sales brokers, property owners and lenders, in our target markets and beyond, and, over the long-term, we believe that we will have opportunities to acquire properties that meet our investment criteria at attractive prices. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include employee compensation costs, professional fees, consulting, and other general administrative expenses. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will rise in some measure as our portfolio grows but that such expenses as a percentage of our revenue will decrease over time due to efficiencies and economies of scale. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We incur capital expenditures at our properties that vary in amount and frequency based on each property s specific needs. We expect our capital expenditures will be for recurring maintenance to ensure our properties are in good working condition, including parking and roof repairs, fa ade maintenance and general upkeep. We also will incur capital expenditures related to repositioning and refurbishing properties where we have identified opportunities to improve our properties to increase occupancy, and we may incur capital expenditures related to redevelopment or development consistent with our business and growth strategies. 
 Fortress Member s Rights 
 On November 22, 2022, the Company, the Operating Partnership and Broad Street Eagles JV LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the Eagles Sub-OP ), entered into a Preferred Equity Investment Agreement with CF Flyer PE Investor LLC (the Fortress Member ), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC, pursuant to which the Fortress Member invested 80.0 million in the Eagles Sub-OP in exchange for a preferred membership interest (the Fortress Preferred Interest and such investment, the Preferred Equity Investment ). In connection with the Preferred Equity Investment, the Operating Partnership and the Fortress Member entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Eagles Sub-OP (the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement ). Under the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Fortress Member has the right to cause the Eagles Sub-OP to redeem the Fortress Preferred Interest by payment to the Fortress Member of the full Redemption Amount (as defined in the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement) upon not less than 90 days prior written notice to the Eagles Sub-OP, unless the Trigger Event is in connection with a Bankruptcy Event (as defined in the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement), in which case the redemption must occur as of the date of such Trigger Event. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Fortress Member would have the right (among other rights) to (i) remove the Operating Partnership as the managing member of the Eagles Sub-OP and to serve as the managing member until the Fortress Member is paid the Redemption Amount, (ii) cause the Eagles Sub-OP to sell one or more properties until the entire Fortress Preferred Interest has been redeemed for the Redemption Amount, (iii) cause the Eagles Sub-OP to use certain reserve accounts to pay the Fortress Member the full Redemption Amount, and (iv) terminate all property management and other service agreements with our affiliates. If the Fortress Member removes the Operating Partnership and becomes the managing member of the Eagles Sub OP, the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement only requires the Fortress Member to act in a manner consistent with other institutional preferred equity investors that have exercised remedies to remove managing members. Moreover, in such a circumstance, the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement specifically reserves the Fortress Member s right to (i) sell any property to a third-party buyer unaffiliated with the Fortress Member, (ii) take any action in connection with curing or reacting to a default under any mortgage loan and (iii) otherwise exercise its rights and remedies pursuant to the terms of the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement. Accordingly, in the event the Fortress Member becomes the managing member of the Eagles Sub-OP, it may take actions that are not in the best interest of us and our stockholders. Further, the mezzanine loan agreement for a mezzanine loan (the Fortress Mezzanine Loan secured by 100 of the membership interests in the entity that owns Midtown Row provides for cross-default in the event of a Trigger Event 
 On May 21, 2024, we agreed with the Fortress Member that, after revision of the total yield calculation as of March 31, 2024, we did not meet the minimum total yield requirement under the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement, which would have been a Trigger Event. Effective May 21, 2024, the Fortress Member and the Operating Partnership entered into a temporary waiver agreement to waive the total yield failure and the existence of the Trigger Event until such time as the Fortress Member elects to revoke such waiver. If the Fortress Member elects to revoke such waiver or a separate Trigger Event occurs, the Fortress Member will be entitled to exercise the rights described above, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 0.2 million, or 2 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of an approximately 0.5 million increase in rental income primarily due to an increase in occupancy period over period. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in commissions due to lower transaction volume of leasing and management fees and other income. 
 Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 1.8 million, or 15 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (i) a 0.6 million decrease in impairment of real estate assets relating to early lease terminations, (ii) a 0.4 million impairment of real estate assets held for sale recognized in the third quarter of 2023 relating to a property that was disposed of during 2023, (iii) a 0.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to a 0.4 million decrease in amortization of in-place lease intangibles, partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in amortization of real property depreciation, (iv) a 0.2 million decrease in property operating expenses of which 0.1 million relates to the disposal of a property in the third quarter of 2023 and (v) a 0.2 million decrease in cost of services. 
 Loss on disposal of properties for the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the loss recognized in connection with the sale of Dekalb Plaza. 
 31 

Interest and other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 0.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 0.1 million of bank interest income and 0.1 million of business interruption proceeds received during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The net loss on derivative fair value adjustment increased approximately 1.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 1.9 million decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps, partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability relating to the Preferred Equity Investment and 0.1 million of losses recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023 relating to an interest rate cap that matured on January 1, 2024. 
 Net gain on fair value change of debt held under the fair value option reflects the change in fair value of the Fortress Mezzanine Loan for which we elected the fair value option. 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 0.1 million, or 2 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the incurrence of 0.2 million of interest expense relating to additional refinancings. This increase was partially offset by a 0.1 million decline in interest expense relating to debt that was repaid in connection with the sale of a property during the third quarter of 2023. We had additional net borrowings of approximately 13.3 million after September 30, 2023 . 
 Income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 2.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily attributable to the Company recording a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Preferred equity return on Fortress preferred equity reflects the portion of the distribution to the Fortress Member that is payable in cash and the portion that is accrued and added to the Preferred Equity Investment. 
 Preferred equity accretion to redemption value reflects the accretion of the carrying value of the Fortress preferred equity to the Redemption amount over the remaining term. 
 Preferred OP units return reflects the portion of the distribution to holders of the Preferred OP units that are payable in cash and the portion that are accrued and added to the liquidation preference of the Preferred OP units. 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.3 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest reflects the proportionate share of the OP units held by outside investors in the operating results of the Operating Partnership.

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 1.7 million, or 5 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of approximately 1.2 million and 0.4 million decreases in rental income and commissions, respectively. Rental income primarily decreased as a result of the sale of two properties in the second and third quarters of 2023, which had aggregate rental income of 2.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in rental income for the remaining properties. The decrease in commissions is due to a lower transaction volume of leasing. 
 Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 6.9 million, or 18 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from (i) a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 3.5 million, primarily related to a 2.8 million decrease in amortization of in-place lease intangibles and a 1.1 million decrease relating to two properties that were disposed of during 2023, partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in amortization of real property depreciation, (ii) a 2.4 million impairment of real estate assets held for sale in 2023 as a result of reducing the carrying value of Dekalb Plaza for the amount that exceeded the property's fair value less estimated selling costs, (iii) a 0.7 million decline in property operating expenses of which 0.6 million relates to two properties that were disposed of during 2023 and (iv) a 0.4 million decline in impairment of real estate assets relating to early lease terminations. 
 Gain on disposal of properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the gain recognized in connection with the sale of Spotswood Valley Square Shopping Center, partially offset by the loss recognized in connection with the sale of Dekalb Plaza. 
 Interest and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 0.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 0.2 million of bank interest income and 0.3 million of business interruption proceeds received during 2024. 
 33 

The loss on derivative fair value adjustment was approximately 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to less than 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of approximately 0.4 million was primarily due to a 1.3 million decline in the fair value of interest rate swaps, partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability relating to the Preferred Equity Investment and 0.1 million of gains recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 relating to an interest rate cap that matured on January 1, 2024. 
 Net gain on fair value change of debt held under the fair value option reflects the change in fair value of the Fortress Mezzanine Loan for which we elected the fair value option. 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 0.5 million, or 4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 1.4 million decline in interest expense, 1.1 million of which relates to debt that was repaid in connection with the sale of two properties during the second and third quarters of 2023 and 0.3 million of which relates to the refinancing of five mortgages and the Basis Term Loan (as defined below). This decline was partially offset by the incurrence of 0.9 million of interest expense relating to additional refinancings. We had additional net borrowings of approximately 13.3 million after September 30, 2023 . 
 Income tax (expense) benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 4.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily attributable to the Company recording a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Preferred equity return on Fortress preferred equity reflects the portion of the distribution to the Fortress Member that is payable in cash and the portion that is accrued and added to the Preferred Equity Investment. 
 Preferred equity accretion to redemption value reflects the accretion of the carrying value of the Fortress preferred equity to the Redemption amount over the remaining term. 
 Preferred OP units return reflects the portion of the distribution to holders of the Preferred OP units that are payable in cash and the portion that are accrued and added to the liquidation preference of the Preferred OP units. 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest reflects the proportionate share of the OP units held by outside investors in the operating results of the Operating Partnership.

Non-GAAP Performance Measures 
 We present the non-GAAP performance measures set forth below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP )) or other GAAP financial measures, as an indicator of financial performance and are not alternatives to, or more meaningful than, cash flow from operating activities (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP performance measures have limitations as they do not include all items of income and expense that affect operations, and accordingly, should always be considered as supplemental financial results to those calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our computation of these non-GAAP performance 
 35 

measures may differ in certain respects from the methodology utilized by other real estate companies and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other real estate companies. Investors are cautioned that items excluded from these non-GAAP performance measures are relevant to understanding and addressing financial performance. 
 Net Operating Income and Same-center Net Operating Income 
 Net operating income NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as rental income less property operating expenses, including real estate taxes. We also exclude the impact of straight line rent revenue, net amortization of above and below market leases, depreciation and amortization, interest, impairments and gains or losses of real estate assets and other significant infrequent items that create volatility in our earnings and make it difficult to determine the earnings generated by our core ongoing business. Same-center NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure to net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our financial performance. We believe that NOI is a helpful measure because it provides additional information to allow management, investors and our current and potential creditors to evaluate and compare our core operating results. 
 Same-center NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure which we use to assess our operating results. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Same-center NOI represents the NOI for 15 properties that were wholly owned and operational for the entire portion of each reporting period. Same-center NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure to net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our financial performance, as it does not reflect the operations of our entire portfolio. We believe that Same-center NOI is a helpful measure because it provides additional information to allow management, investors and our current and potential creditors to enhance the comparability of our operating performance between periods.

(2) Rental income for the retail portfolio excludes 0.1 million of business interruption proceeds for rent that was abated due to a fire at one of our retail properties. This amount is reflected in net interest and other income. 

The increase in total Same-center NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is mainly due to (i) an increase in occupancy due to higher leasing activity and scheduled rent increases for retail period over period, (ii) an increase in recoveries from tenants and (iii) an increase in residential base rent.

Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 Funds from operations FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit defines FFO as follows: net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Considering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that FFO is useful to investors in measuring our operating and financial performance because the definition excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance, such as depreciation and amortization related to real estate, and items which can make periodic and peer analysis of operating and financial performance more difficult, such as gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to 
 38 

fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. Also, FFO should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted FFO AFFO is calculated by excluding the effect of certain items that do not reflect ongoing property operations, including stock-based compensation expense, deferred financing and debt issuance cost amortization, non-real estate depreciation and amortization, straight-line rent expense, straight-line rent revenue, non-cash interest expense and other non-comparable or non-operating items. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company s operational performance than FFO. 
 AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. We believe that Net income/(loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of real estate companies and presenting AFFO enables investors to assess our performance in comparison to other real estate companies. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. 
 Our reconciliation of net loss to FFO and AFFO for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

The decrease in FFO and AFFO for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is mainly due to a 2.3 million decrease in income tax benefit primarily attributable to the Company recording a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by a net reduction of 0.2 million of total revenues. The decrease in AFFO was also partially offset by non-cash fair value adjustment relating to the increase in net loss on derivative instruments and the decline in fair value change of debt held under the fair value option. See Results of Operations for further discussion.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre) and Adjusted EBITDAre 
 We calculate EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by Nareit and define EBITDAre as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP (i) plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income tax expense, (ii) plus or minus losses or gains on the disposition of properties, (iii) plus impairment losses and (iv) with appropriate adjustments to reflect our share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates and consolidated affiliates with non-controlling interests, in each case as applicable. We define Adjusted EBITDAre as EBITDAre plus non-cash stock compensation, non-cash amortization related to above and below market leases, straight-line rent expense and less straight-line rent revenue and non-cash fair value adjustment. Some of the adjustments can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be viewed as alternatives to net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are helpful measures because they provide additional information to allow management, investors and our current and potential creditors to evaluate and compare our core operating results and our ability to service debt. We also believe that EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre can help facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other real estate companies. 
 Our reconciliation of net loss to EBIDTAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

EBITDAre decreased 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 mainly due to an increase in loss on derivative fair value adjustment, partially offset by an increase in total revenues and an overall decline in operating expenses primarily relating to cost of services and property operating expenses. See Results of Operations above for further discussion. 
 Adjusted EBITDAre increased 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 mainly due to an increase in total revenues, an increase in interest and other income and an overall decline in operating expenses primarily relating to cost of services, property operating expenses and general and administrative costs. See Results of Operations above for further discussion. 
 EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre decreased 0.2 million and less than 0.1 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 mainly due to a decline in total revenues, partially offset by an increase in interest and other income and a decline in operating expenses primarily relating to cost of services and property operating expenses. See Results of Operations above for further discussion. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay any outstanding borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations and other general business needs. 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of debt service requirements, operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures (such as repairs and maintenance of our properties), and non-recurring capital expenditures (such as capital improvements and tenant improvements). As of September 30, 2024 and November 6, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 
 41 

approximately 18.0 million and 17.5 million, respectively, and restricted cash of approximately 4.8 million and 5.1 million, respectively, which is available for debt service shortfall requirements, certain capital expenditures, real estate taxes and insurance. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had three mortgage loans (Hollinswood Shopping Center Loan, Brookhill Azalea Shopping Center Loan and Avondale Shops Loan) with a combined principal balance outstanding of approximately 24.2 million that will mature within twelve months of the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report are issued. On October 28, 2024, we entered into an agreement to extend the maturity date of the Hollinswood Shopping Center Loan to March 1, 2025. Management is in discussions with the current lenders as well as various other lenders to extend or refinance these three mortgage loans prior to maturity. Although we have a history of demonstrating our ability to successfully refinance our loans as they come due, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to refinance the loans on favorable terms or at all. While it is not our current plan, we also have the option to sell the properties securing the loans and use the proceeds to satisfy the outstanding loan obligations. If we are ultimately unable to repay or refinance these loans or sell the properties prior to maturity, the lender has the right to place the loans in default and ultimately foreclose on the properties securing the loans. Under this circumstance, we would not have any further financial obligations to the lenders as the current estimated market values of these properties are in excess of the outstanding loan balances. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements are expected to consist primarily of funds necessary for the repayment of debt at or prior to maturity, capital improvements, development and/or redevelopment of properties and property acquisitions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through net cash from operations, additional secured and unsecured debt and, subject to market conditions, the issuance of additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or OP units. 
 Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including general market conditions, the market s perception of our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, our current debt levels and the market price of the shares of our common stock. Although our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX Best Market, there is a very limited trading market for our common stock, and if a more active trading market is not developed and sustained, we will be limited in our ability to issue equity to fund our capital needs. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to meet the capital and operating needs of our properties, satisfy our debt service obligations or pay dividends to our stockholders. 
 As described below, under our existing debt agreements, we are subject to continuing covenants. In the event of a default, the lenders could accelerate the timing of payments under the applicable debt obligations, and we may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the other covenants under our debt agreements.

(2) We have entered into an interest rate swap which fixes the interest rate of this loan at 4.06 until December 1, 2024. 

(3) On February 8, 2024, we refinanced the Vista Shops at Golden Mile Loan to extend the maturity date to February 8, 2029 and entered into an interest rate swap which fixes the interest rate of the new loan at 6.90 . 

(4) We have entered into an interest rate swap which fixes the interest rate of this loan at 6.085 . 

(5) The outstanding balance reflects the fair value of the debt. 

(6) A portion of the interest on this loan is paid in cash (the Current Interest and a portion of the interest is capitalized and added to the principal amount of the loan each month (the Capitalized Interest and, together with the Current Interest, the Mezzanine Loan Interest ). The initial Mezzanine Loan Interest rate was 12 per annum, comprised of a 5 Current Interest rate and a 7 Capitalized Interest rate. The Capitalized Interest rate increases each year by 1 . 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 232.7 million and 208.4 million, respectively, of outstanding mortgage indebtedness secured by individual properties. The Hollinswood mortgage, Vista Shops mortgage, Brookhill mortgage, Crestview mortgage, Highlandtown mortgage, Cromwell mortgage, Lamar Station Plaza West mortgage, Midtown Row mortgage, Coral Hills mortgage, West Broad mortgage and Greenwood Village mortgage require the Company to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio (as such term is defined in the respective loan agreements) as follows in the table below.

On April 30, 2024, we received a 19.2 million loan secured by Midtown Colonial and Midtown Lamonticello, which bears interest at a rate of 7.92 per annum and matures on May 1, 2027. We used a portion of the proceeds from the new mortgage loan to pay off the loan that was previously secured by Midtown Colonial and Midtown Lamonticello (the Basis Term Loan ). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements. 
 See Note 8, Mortgage and Other Indebtedness for further information. 
 Fortress Preferred Equity Investment 
 On November 22, 2022, the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Eagles Sub-OP entered into a Preferred Equity Investment Agreement with the Fortress Member pursuant to which the Fortress Member invested 80.0 million in the Eagles Sub-OP in exchange for the Fortress Preferred Interest. 
 In connection with the Preferred Equity Investment, the Operating Partnership and the Fortress Member entered into the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement, and the Operating Partnership contributed to the Eagles Sub-OP its subsidiaries that, directly or indirectly, own Brookhill Azalea Shopping Center, Vista Shops, Hollinswood Shopping Center, Avondale Shops, Greenwood Village Shopping Center and Lamar Station Plaza East in November 2022, as well as Cromwell Field in December 2022. Pursuant to the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement, the Operating Partnership had the obligation to contribute to the Eagles Sub-OP its direct or indirect subsidiaries owning eight properties. As of September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership had contributed to the Eagles Sub-OP its subsidiaries that own Highlandtown, Crestview, Coral Hills, West Broad, Midtown Colonial and Midtown Lamonticello and, with the approval of the Fortress Member, sold Spotswood and Dekalb Plaza (collectively, the Excluded Properties ). 
 Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Eagles Sub-OP (the Eagles Sub-OP Operating Agreement ), the Fortress Member is entitled to monthly distributions, a portion of which is paid in cash (the Current Preferred Return and a portion that accrues on and is added to the Preferred Equity Investment each month (the Capitalized Preferred Return and, together with the Current Preferred Return, the Preferred Return ). The initial Preferred Return was 12 per annum, comprised of a 5 Current Preferred Return and a 7 Capitalized Preferred Return, provided that, until certain of the Excluded Properties were contributed to the Eagles Sub-OP, the Capitalized Preferred Return was increased by 4.75 . The Capitalized Preferred Return increases each year by 1 . Commencing on November 22, 2027, the Preferred Return will be 19 per annum, all payable in cash, and will increase an additional 3 each year thereafter. Upon (i) the occurrence of a Trigger Event, (ii) during a three-month period in which distributions on the Preferred Equity Investment are not made because such payments would cause a violation of Delaware law or (iii) if a Qualified Public Offering has not occurred on or prior to November 22, 2027, the entire Preferred Return shall accrue at the then-applicable Preferred Return plus 4 and shall be payable monthly in cash. As of September 30, 2024, the Capitalized Preferred Return was approximately 17.1 million and is reflected within Redeemable noncontrolling Fortress preferred interest on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.2 million and 1.1 million, respectively, of Current Preferred Return and 2.0 million and 2.6 million, respectively, of Capitalized Preferred Return, as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated statements of equity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 3.6 million and 3.2 million, respectively, of Current Preferred Return and 5.7 million and 7.5 million, respectively, of Capitalized Preferred Return, as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated statements of equity. 
 On May 21, 2024, we agreed with the Fortress Member that, after revision of the total yield calculation as of March 31, 2024, we did not meet the minimum total yield requirement, which would have been a Trigger Event. Effective May 21, 2024, the Fortress Member and the Operating Partnership entered into a temporary waiver agreement to waive the total yield failure and the existence of the Trigger Event until such time as the Fortress Member elects to revoke such waiver. Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the 
 44 

Fortress Member has the right to cause the Eagles Sub-OP to redeem the Fortress Preferred Interest by payment to the Fortress Member of the full Redemption Amount upon not less than 90 days prior written notice to the Eagles Sub-OP. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Fortress Member would have the right (among other rights) to (i) remove the Operating Partnership as the managing member of the Eagles Sub-OP and to serve as the managing member until the Fortress Member is paid the Redemption Amount, (ii) cause the Eagles Sub-OP to sell one or more properties until the entire Fortress Preferred Interest has been redeemed for the Redemption Amount, (iii) cause the Eagles Sub-OP to use certain reserve accounts to pay the Fortress Member the full Redemption Amount, and (iv) terminate all property management and other service agreements with our affiliates. Further, the mezzanine loan agreement for the Fortress Mezzanine Loan provides for cross-default in the event of a Trigger Event. 
 See Note 10 Fortress Preferred Equity Investment for further information.

Operating Activities- Cash from operating activities increased by approximately 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating cash flows were primarily impacted by a net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 1.9 million, of which approximately 1.6 million, 0.4 million and 0.2 million was related to the net change in accounts payable, deferred revenue and accounts receivable, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a decline of approximately 0.3 million in other assets. 
 Investing Activities- Cash from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 41.9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease resulted primarily from the 44.8 million of proceeds received from the sale of the Spotswood property and the Dekalb property in 2023. This decrease was partially offset by approximately 2.1 million of insurance proceeds received in 2024 relating to fire damage at two of our retail properties and a 0.8 million decrease in capital expenditures for real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 Financing Activities- Cash from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 46.4 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from (i) the 11.9 million repayment of the Spotswood mortgage loan in 2023 with proceeds from the sale of the Spotswood property, (ii) a net increase of 10.6 million from the financing of the Midtown Colonial and Midtown Lamonticello properties in 2024 that were previously collateral for the Basis Term Loan, with a portion of the proceeds used to pay off the Basis Term Loan, (iii) a net increase in the Vista Shops at Golden Mile Loan of approximately 4.9 million from the refinance of the loan, (iv) the 3.9 million redemption of the preferred interest in one of our subsidiaries in 2023 with proceeds from the sale of the Spotswood property and the refinancing of the mortgage loan secured by Highlandtown and (v) additional draws of 1.5 million relating to the Cromwell Field Shopping Center Loan. These increases were partially offset by (i) the 31.7 million repayment of the Basis Term Loan with proceeds from the sale of the Dekalb property and the new 12.0 million loan secured by Crestview in 2023, (ii) 3.5 million related to the new mortgage loan secured by Highlandtown in 2023, (iii) net proceeds of 1.4 million related to the Greenwood Village interest rate swap, (iv) a 0.5 million increase in debt origination and discount fees, (v) a 0.4 million increase of the Preferred Return on the Preferred Equity Investment during 2024 and (vi) an increase in scheduled principal payments on loans of approximately 0.4 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as set forth in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level described above. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
