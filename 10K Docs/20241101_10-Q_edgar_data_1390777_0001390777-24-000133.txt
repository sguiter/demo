Highlights of third quarter 2024 results 
 
 Net income applicable to common shareholders was 1.11 billion, or 1.50 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2024, including the impact of notable items. Notable items in the third quarter of 2024 include severance expense, litigation reserves and a reduction in the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, net income applicable to common shareholders was 1.13 billion (Non-GAAP), or 1.52 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2024. Net income applicable to common shareholders was 958 million, or 1.23 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2023, including the impact of notable items. Notable items in the third quarter of 2023 include severance expense, litigation reserves and a disposal gain. Excluding notable items, net income applicable to common shareholders was 994 million (Non-GAAP), or 1.27 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The highlights below are based on the third quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter of 2023, unless otherwise noted. 
 Total revenue increased 5 , primarily reflecting: 
 Fee revenue increased 5 , primarily reflecting higher market values, net new business and higher foreign exchange revenue. (See Fee and other revenue beginning on page 6 .) 
 Investment and other revenue increased primarily reflecting a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and improved results from our seed capital investments. (See Fee and other revenue beginning on page 6 .) 
 Net interest income increased 3 , primarily reflecting improved investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. (See Net interest income on page 9 .) 
 Provision for credit losses was 23 million, primarily driven by increases in the allowance related to commercial real estate exposure. 
 Noninterest expense was flat, reflecting higher investments and employee merit increases, offset by efficiency savings and a reduction in the FDIC 

special assessment. Excluding notable items, noninterest expense increased 1 (Non-GAAP). (See Noninterest expense on page 12 .) 
 Effective tax rate of 22.0 . (See Income taxes on page 12 .) 
 Return on common equity ROE was 12.0 for the third quarter of 2024. 
 Return on tangible common equity ROTCE was 22.8 (Non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2024. Excluding notable items, the adjusted ROTCE was 23.2 (Non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 See Supplemental information Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures beginning on page 43 for a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP measures. 
 
 Metrics 
 
 AUC/A of 52.1 trillion increased 14 , primarily reflecting higher market values, client inflows and net new business. 
 AUM of 2.1 trillion increased 18 , primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. 
 
 Capital and liquidity 
 
 Our CET1 ratio was 11.9 at Sept. 30, 2024 and 11.4 at June 30, 2024 under the Standardized Approach. The increase reflects capital generated through earnings and improvements in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned through common stock repurchases and dividends, and higher risk-weighted assets. (See Capital beginning on page 35 .) 
 Tier 1 leverage was 6.0 at Sept. 30, 2024 and 5.8 at June 30, 2024. The increase reflects the increase in capital, partially offset by higher average assets. (See Capital beginning on page 35 .) 
 Returned 1.1 billion to common shareholders, including 725 million of common share repurchases.

 N/M Not meaningful. 

Fee revenue increased 5 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and was flat compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher investment services fees, foreign exchange revenue and investment management and performance fees. Compared with the second quarter of 2024, higher investment management and performance fees were offset by lower investment services fees and foreign exchange revenue. 
 
 Investment and other revenue increased 37 million compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 27 million compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and improved results from our seed capital investments. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects improved seed capital results and higher client activity in our fixed income and equity trading business. 
 
 Investment services fees 
 
 Investment services fees increased 5 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 1 compared 

with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher market values, net new business and higher client activity, partially offset by lower Depositary Receipts revenue. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts revenue, partially offset by higher market values. 
 
 AUC/A totaled 52.1 trillion at Sept. 30, 2024, an increase of 14 compared with Sept. 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market values, client inflows and net new business. AUC/A consisted of 37 equity securities and 63 fixed income securities at Sept. 30, 2024, and 34 equity securities and 66 fixed income securities at Sept. 30, 2023. 
 
 See Securities Services business segment and Market and Wealth Services business segment in Review of business segments for additional details. 
 
 Investment management and performance fees 
 
 Investment management and performance fees increased 2 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 4 compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 

6 BNY 

primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher market values and the timing of performance fees. Performance fees were 13 million in the third quarter of 2024, 30 million in the third quarter of 2023 and 8 million in the second quarter of 2024. On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP), investment management and performance fees increased 2 compared with the third quarter of 2023. See Supplemental information Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures beginning on page 43 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures. 
 
 AUM was 2.1 trillion at Sept. 30, 2024, an increase of 18 compared with Sept. 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. 
 
 See Investment and Wealth Management business segment in Review of business segments for additional details regarding the drivers of investment management and performance fees, AUM and AUM flows. 
 
 Foreign exchange revenue 
 
 Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the volume of client transactions and the spread realized on these transactions, both of which are impacted by market volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign exchange revenue increased 14 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 5 compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher volumes. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects lower volumes, partially offset by higher volatility. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily reported in the Securities Services business segment and, to a lesser extent, in the Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management business segments and the Other segment. 

Financing-related fees 
 
 Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the Market and Wealth Services and Securities Services business segments, include capital market fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-related fees increased 18 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and were flat compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher underwriting fees. 
 
 Investment and other revenue 
 
 Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from consolidated investment management funds, seed capital gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable energy investments gains, income from corporate and bank-owned life insurance contracts, other investment gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The income or loss from consolidated investment management funds should be considered together with the net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not have an economic interest and is reflected below net income as a separate line item on the consolidated income statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our seed capital investments in investment management funds, non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading, and other hedging activity. Other investment gains or losses includes fair value changes of non-readily marketable strategic equity, private equity and other investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income includes various miscellaneous revenues.

 (a) Includes gains (losses) on investments in BNY funds which hedge deferred incentive awards. 
 (b) Results for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2023 and the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023 were restated to reflect the retrospective application of adopting new accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2024 related to our investments in renewable energy projects using the proportional amortization method (ASU 2023-02). See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 (c) Includes strategic equity, private equity and other investments. 

The increase in total investment and other revenue compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and improved results from our seed capital investments. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects improved seed capital results and higher client activity in our fixed income and equity trading business. 
 
 Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023 
 
 Fee revenue increased 5 compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting higher investment services fees. The 6 increase in investment services fees primarily reflects higher 

market values, net new business and higher client activity. Investment management and performance fees increased 1 , primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. The 5 increase in foreign exchange revenue primarily reflects higher volumes, partially offset by lower volatility. 
 
 Investment and other revenue increased 110 million compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting higher client activity in our fixed income and equity trading business, strategic equity investment losses recorded in the first nine months of 2023 and improved seed capital results, partially offset by higher securities losses.

 bps basis points. 

Net interest income increased 3 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 2 compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects improved investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher sponsored member cleared repo activity. 
 
 Net interest margin decreased 2 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2023 and increased 1 basis point compared with the second quarter of 2024. The changes compared with the third quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflect the factors mentioned above. 
 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 5 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 1 compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher securities and loan balances and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with banks. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher securities balances and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. 

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately 25 of our average total deposits in the third quarter of 2024. Approximately 50 of the average non-U.S. dollar deposits in the third quarter of 2024 were euro-denominated. 
 
 Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023 
 
 Net interest income decreased 4 compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by changes in balance sheet mix, partially offset by higher interest rates. The decrease in the net interest margin primarily reflects the factors mentioned above. 
 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 1 compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting higher loan balances and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Total noninterest expense was flat compared with the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher investments and employee merit increases, offset by efficiency savings and a reduction in the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, total noninterest expense increased 1 (Non-GAAP) compared with the third quarter of 2023. The investments in growth, infrastructure and efficiency initiatives are primarily included in staff, software and equipment, and professional, legal and other purchased services expenses. Total noninterest expense increased 1 compared with the second quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting higher investments and the impact of the adjustments to the FDIC special assessment recorded in the second and third quarters of 2024.

 On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method , on a retrospective basis. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the new accounting guidance.

Review of business segments 
 
 We have an internal information system that produces performance data along product and service lines for our three principal business segments: Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management, and the Other segment. 

12 BNY 

Business segment accounting principles 
 
 Our business segment data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting principles GAAP used for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the businesses will track their economic performance. 
 
 For information on the accounting principles of our business segments, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the primary products and services in each line of business, the primary types of revenue by line of business and how our business segments are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Business segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made, or for refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis. There were no reclassifications or organizational changes in the third quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, we made certain realignments of similar products and services within our lines of business consistent with the firm s ongoing transition to a platforms operating model uniting related capabilities and enabling streamlining of internal processes to drive growth, efficiency, resiliency, and enhanced risk management. The largest change was the movement of Institutional Solutions from Pershing to Clearance and Collateral Management, both in the Market and Wealth Services business segment. We made other smaller changes that moved activity from Asset Servicing in the Securities Services business segment to Treasury Services in the Market and Wealth Services business segment, and from Wealth Management in the Investment and Wealth Management business segment and Pershing in the Market and Wealth Services business segment to Investment Management in the Investment and Wealth Management business segment. The Other segment was not impacted by the changes. Business segment results for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023 have been revised to reflect these changes. 
 
 The results of our business segments may be influenced by client and other activities that vary by 

quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense typically increases, reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees. The timing of our annual employee merit increases also impacts staff expense. In 2024, the merit increase was effective in March, thus partially impacting the first quarter and second quarter staff expense variances. For 2023, the merit increase was effective at the beginning of the second quarter. In the third quarter, volume-related fees may decline due to reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher business development and marketing expenses. In our Investment and Wealth Management business segment, performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and first quarters, as those quarters represent the end of the measurement period for many of the performance fee-eligible relationships. 
 
 The results of our business segments may also be impacted by the translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by activities denominated in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated basis and in our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services business segments, we typically have more foreign currency-denominated expenses than revenues. However, our Investment and Wealth Management business segment typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues than expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth Management business segment more than the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services business segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact net income on a consolidated basis. 
 
 Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management business segment, and, to a lesser extent, the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services business segments, is impacted by global market fluctuations. At Sept. 30, 2024, we estimated that a 5 change in global equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would impact fee revenue by less than 1 and diluted earnings per common share by 0.04 to 0.07. 
 
 See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the consolidating schedules, which show the contribution of our business segments to our overall profitability.

 Review of financial results 
 
 AUC/A of 37.5 trillion increased 16 compared with Sept. 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market values, net new business and client inflows. 
 
 Total revenue of 2.2 billion increased 6 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 1 compared with the second quarter of 2024. The drivers of total revenue by line of business are indicated below. 
 
 Asset Servicing revenue of 1.7 billion increased 9 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 2 compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher market values and client activity, a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of 2023, net new business and higher net interest income. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher net interest income and market values. 
 
 Issuer Services revenue of 494 million was flat compared with the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 11 compared with the second quarter of 2024. Compared with the third quarter of 2023, total revenue reflects higher Corporate Trust fees offset by lower Depositary Receipts revenue. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts revenue and net interest income. 
 
 Market and regulatory trends are driving investable assets toward lower fee asset management products at reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are also negatively impacting our investment services fees. However, at the same time, these trends are providing additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and other market participants seek to comply with regulations and reduce their operating costs. 
 
 Noninterest expense of 1.6 billion decreased 3 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and was flat compared with the second quarter of 2024. The 

BNY 15 

decrease compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects efficiency savings and lower severance expense, partially offset by higher investments and employee merit increases. 
 
 Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023 
 
 Total revenue of 6.6 billion increased 3 compared with the first nine months of 2023. Asset Servicing revenue of 5.1 billion increased 3 compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting higher market values, higher client activity in our fixed income and trading businesses, net new business and a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by lower net interest income. Issuer Services revenue of 1.5 billion increased 2 , primarily reflecting higher Corporate Trust fees, partially offset by lower Depositary Receipts revenue. 
 
 Noninterest expense of 4.6 billion decreased 1 compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting efficiency savings and lower severance expense, partially offset by higher investments and employee merit increases.

 Review of financial results 
 
 AUM of 2.1 trillion as of Sept. 30, 2024, increased 18 compared with Sept. 30, 2023, primarily 

reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. 
 
 Net long-term strategy outflows were 24 billion in the third quarter of 2024, driven by index, multi-asset and alternative, liability-driven and equity investments, partially offset by inflows of fixed income investments. Short-term strategy inflows were 24 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Market and regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand for lower fee asset management products and for performance-based fees. 
 
 Total revenue of 849 million increased 2 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 3 compared with the second quarter of 2024. The drivers of total revenue by line of business are indicated below.

 Wealth Management revenue of 280 million increased 6 compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 3 compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher market values and net interest income, partially offset by changes in product mix. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher market values. 
 
 Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth Management business segment included 31 from non-U.S. sources in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 33 in the third quarter of 2023 and 30 in the second quarter of 2024. 

Noninterest expense of 672 million was flat compared with the third quarter of 2023 and increased 1 compared with the second quarter of 2024. Compared with the third quarter of 2023, total noninterest expense reflects efficiency savings, offset by employee merit increases and higher investments. 
 
 Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

 Review of financial results 
 
 Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other investment activity, including hedging activity, which has an offsetting impact between fee and other revenue and net interest expense. 

Total revenue decreased 23 million compared with the third quarter of 2023 and increased 33 million compared with the second quarter of 2024. The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects debt extinguishment gains recorded in the third quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects gains on real estate and other investments. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased 13 million compared with the third quarter of 2023 and 22 million 

BNY 21 

compared with the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher staff expense, partially offset by a reduction in the FDIC special assessment. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects the impact of the adjustments to the FDIC special assessment recorded in the second and third quarters of 2024.

 Loss before income taxes increased 15 million compared with the first nine months of 2023. Total revenue decreased 10 million, primarily reflecting debt extinguishment gains recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and higher net securities losses, partially offset by improved investment results. 
 
 Noninterest expense decreased 19 million compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting reductions in the FDIC special assessment and lower litigation reserves, partially offset by higher staff expense. 

Critical accounting estimates 
 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory contingencies, as referenced below.

 Reference Allowance for credit losses 2023 Annual Report, pages 23-24, and Allowance for credit losses. Goodwill and other intangibles 2023 Annual Report, pages 24-25. Also see below. Litigation and regulatory contingencies Legal proceedings in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill and other intangibles 
 
 BNY s business segments include seven reporting units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed on an annual basis. An interim goodwill impairment test is performed when events or circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, due to the results of the second quarter 2024 interim test and macroeconomic conditions, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test of the Investment Management reporting unit, which had 6.1 billion of allocated goodwill. The fair value of the Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 . We determined the fair value of the Investment Management reporting unit using an income approach based on management s projections as of Sept. 30, 2024. The discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10.5 . 
 
 As of Sept. 30, 2024, if the discount rate applied to the estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management reporting unit would decrease or increase by 4 , respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growth rate was increased or decreased by 10 basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management reporting unit would increase or decrease by approximately 1 , respectively. 
 
 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult to estimate over such an extended time frame. In the future, changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could produce a material non-cash goodwill impairment.

Consolidated balance sheet review 
 
 One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders, including our shareholders, clients, creditors and regulators. 
 
 We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite. The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing the competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, total assets were 427 billion, compared with 410 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by higher securities, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements and loans, partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. Deposits totaled 296 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 284 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase reflects higher interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits. Total interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning assets were 64 at Sept. 30, 2024 and 66 at Dec. 31, 2023. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, available funds totaled 154 billion and included cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. This compares with available funds of 158 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Total available funds as a percentage of total assets was 36 at Sept. 30, 2024 and 38 at Dec. 31, 2023. For additional information on our available funds, see Liquidity and dividends. 
 
 Securities were 142 billion, or 33 of total assets, at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 126 billion, or 31 of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase 

primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government, U.S. Treasury and agency residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS and unrealized pre-tax gains in the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by lower U.S. government agencies securities. For additional information on our securities portfolio, see Securities and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Loans were 69 billion, or 16 of total assets, at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 67 billion, or 16 of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase was driven by higher loans in the financial institutions portfolio and capital call financing, partially offset by lower overdrafts and commercial and wealth management loans. For additional information on our loan portfolio, see Loans and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Long-term debt totaled 33 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 31 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Issuances and an increase in the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset by maturities and redemptions. For additional information on long-term debt, see Liquidity and dividends. 
 
 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders equity totaled 42 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 41 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. For additional information, see Capital. 

Country risk exposure 
 
 The following table presents BNY s top 10 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of Sept. 30, 2024, as well as certain countries with higher risk profiles. The exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and has not been reduced by the allowance for credit losses. We monitor our exposure to these and other countries as part of our internal country risk management process. 
 
 The country risk exposure below reflects the Company s risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor based on the country of residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence of the entity providing the risk mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer of the security.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing investment services and investment management services. 
 
 The war in Ukraine increased our focus on Russia. The country risk exposure to Russia consists of cash balances related to our securities services businesses and may increase in the future to the extent cash is received for the benefit of our clients that is subject to distribution restrictions. BNY has ceased new banking business in Russia and suspended investment 

management purchases of Russian securities. At Sept. 30, 2024, less than 0.1 of our AUC/A and less than 0.01 of our AUM consisted of Russian securities. We will continue to work with multinational clients that depend on our custody and recordkeeping services to manage their exposures. 
 
 We are monitoring our exposure to Israel as part of our internal country risk management process. At Sept. 30, 2024, our total exposure to Israel was 252 million and primarily consisted of investment grade short-term interest-bearing deposits and OTC derivatives maturing within six months. 

Securities 
 
 In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings information because the information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our securities portfolio.

The after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities is 774 million and the after-tax equivalent related to held-to-maturity securities is 2,789 million. 

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related hedges, was 139.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 123.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government, U.S. Treasury and agency RMBS securities and unrealized pre-tax gains in the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by lower U.S. government agencies securities. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, the securities portfolio had a net unrealized loss, including the impact of related hedges, of 4.7 billion, compared with 7.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the unrealized loss, including the impact of related hedges, primarily reflects the impact of securities moving closer to maturity and lower market interest rates. 
 
 The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled 98.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, net of hedges, or 70 of the securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the held-to-maturity securities totaled 41.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, or 30 of the securities portfolio, net of hedges. 

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other comprehensive income was 774 million at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the net unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, primarily reflects the impact of securities moving closer to maturity and lower market interest rates. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, 98 of the securities in our portfolio were rated AAA/AA-, compared with 99 at Dec. 31, 2023.

At Sept. 30, 2024, our total lending-related exposure of 122.2 billion increased 6 compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher exposure in the financial institutions portfolio. 

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios comprise our largest concentrated risk. These portfolios comprised 49 of our total exposure at Sept. 30, 2024 and 46 at Dec. 31, 2023. Additionally, most of our overdrafts relate to financial institutions.

26 BNY 

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was 46.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, an increase of 17 compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher exposure in the securities industry and banks portfolios. 
 
 Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 96 of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating classification at Sept. 30, 2024. Each customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over time. For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign rating of the country where the counterparty resides, regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying collateral. 
 
 The exposure to financial institutions is generally short term, with 85 of the exposures expiring within one year. At Sept. 30, 2024, 46 of the exposure to financial institutions had an expiration within 90 days, compared with 19 at Dec. 31, 2023. 
 
 In addition, 65 of the financial institutions exposure is secured. For example, securities industry clients 

and asset managers often borrow against marketable securities held in custody. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, the secured intraday credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity totaled 13.5 billion and was included in the securities industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit. Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately 29 of the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio and are reviewed and reapproved annually. 
 
 The asset managers portfolio exposure is high quality, with 96 of the exposures meeting our investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of Sept. 30, 2024. These exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated mutual funds. 
 
 Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to global trade finance. These exposures are short term in nature, with 94 due in less than one year. The investment grade percentage of our banks portfolio exposure was 85 at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 84 at Dec. 31, 2023. Our non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade finance loans in Brazil.

Wealth management loans 
 
 Our wealth management loan exposure was 9.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 9.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth management loans primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, a majority of which are secured by the customers investment management accounts or custody accounts. 
 
 Wealth management mortgages 
 
 Our wealth management mortgage exposure was 9.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 9.4 billion 

at Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth management mortgages primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which are secured by residential property. Wealth management mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 61 at origination. At Sept. 30, 2024, less than 1 of the mortgages were past due. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, the wealth management mortgage portfolio consisted of the following geographic concentrations: California 21 ; New York 14 ; Florida 11 ; Massachusetts 8 ; and other 46 .

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled 10.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 10.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners and are structured with moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending activities also include construction and renovation facilities. Our client base consists of experienced developers and long-term holders of real estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of existing or projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and knowledge of local market conditions. Development loans are structured with moderate leverage and, in many instances, involve some level of recourse to the developer. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real estate investment trusts REITs and real estate operating companies, which are both primarily investment grade. 

At Sept. 30, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio consisted of the following concentrations: New York metro 34 ; REITs and real estate operating companies 29 ; and other 37 . 
 
 Lease financings 
 
 The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled 601 million at Sept. 30, 2024 and 599 million at Dec. 31, 2023. At Sept. 30, 2024, nearly all of leasing exposure was investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets, primarily real estate and large-ticket transportation equipment. Assets are both domestic and foreign-based, with primary concentrations in Germany and the U.S. 
 
 Other residential mortgages 
 
 The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and 

28 BNY 

totaled 1.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 1.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. 
 
 Overdrafts 
 
 Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance clients and are generally repaid within two business days. 
 
 Capital call financing 
 
 Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds that are secured by the fund investors capital commitments and the funds rights to call capital. 

Other loans 
 
 Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-income securities. 
 
 Margin loans 
 
 Margin loan exposure of 18.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 was collateralized with marketable securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral margin in excess of 100 of the value of the loan. Margin loans included 8 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 7 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 related to a term loan program that offers fully collateralized loans to broker-dealers. 

Allowance for credit losses 
 
 Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses. 
 
 The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses.

 (a) Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks. 

Provision for credit losses was 23 million, primarily driven by increases in the allowance related to commercial real estate exposure. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments represent 

management s estimate of lifetime expected losses in our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or management s judgment, the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs. 

BNY 29 

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as discussed in Critical accounting estimates in our 2023 Annual Report, we have allocated our allowance for loans and lending-related commitments as presented below.

 (a) The allowance allocated to margin loans, overdrafts and other loans was insignificant at Sept. 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, Dec. 31, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2023. 
 (b) The methodology used to allocate the qualitative reserves was modified in the second quarter of 2024 to align certain specifically identifiable qualitative reserves with the respective class of financing receivables. For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the losses. 

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs, most notably the macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated into our estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan portfolio, as well as the credit ratings assigned to each borrower. As the macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change, the allowance for credit losses may change materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or the economic environment, but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs. If commercial real estate property values were increased 10 and all other credits were rated one grade better, the quantitative allowance would have decreased by 51 million, and if commercial real estate property values were decreased 10 and all other credits were rated one grade worse, the quantitative allowance would have 

increased by 83 million. Our multi-scenario-based macroeconomic forecast used in determining the Sept. 30, 2024 allowance for credit losses consisted of three scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects positive but slightly declining GDP growth, stable unemployment and slightly declining commercial real estate prices through the end of 2024. The upside scenario reflects higher GDP growth through the fourth quarter 2024 before moderating, declining unemployment through the end of 2024 and stable commercial real estate prices through the end of 2024 compared with the baseline. The downside scenario contemplates negative GDP growth through the fourth quarter of 2024 before moderating, rapidly increasing unemployment through the third quarter of 2025 and sharply lower commercial real estate prices than the baseline. At Sept. 30, 2024, we placed the most weight on our baseline scenario, with the remaining weighting placed on the upside and downside scenarios. From a sensitivity perspective, at Sept. 30, 2024, if we had applied 100 weighting to the downside scenario, the allowance for credit losses would have been approximately 123 million higher.

Nonperforming assets 
 
 The table below presents our nonperforming assets.

Deposits 
 
 Total deposits were 296.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, an increase of 5 , compared with 283.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase reflects higher interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits (principally U.S. offices). 
 
 Noninterest-bearing deposits were 61.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 58.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits were primarily demand deposits and totaled 234.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 225.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. 

Short-term borrowings 
 
 We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-term borrowings, for example, securities sold under repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as collateral. 
 
 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation 

FICC ), where we record interest expense on a gross basis, but the ending and average balances reflect the impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements. This activity primarily relates to government securities collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC. 
 
 Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on demand. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity and market volatility. 
 
 The Bank of New York Mellon issues commercial paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment. 
 
 Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our Securities Services businesses, finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences for settlements. 

Liquidity and dividends 
 
 BNY defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue new debt, especially during periods of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet its short-term (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that BNY cannot meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding mismatches, market constraints from the inability to convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent liquidity events. 
 
 Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputational risks also can affect BNY s liquidity risk profile and are considered in our liquidity risk framework. For additional information, see Risk Management Liquidity Risk in our 2023 Annual Report. 

BNY 31 

The Parent s policy is to have access to sufficient unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments for the following 18-month period, and to provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
 
 We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding needs within and across significant legal entities, branches, currencies and business lines, taking into account, among other factors, any applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity among entities. 

BNY also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency funding and available collateral) to enable BNY to meet its intraday obligations under normal and reasonably severe stressed conditions. 
 
 We define available funds for internal liquidity management purposes as cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. 

The following table presents our total available funds at period end and on an average basis. 
 
 Available funds Sept. 30, 2024 Dec. 31, 2023 Average (dollars in millions) 3Q24 2Q24 3Q23 YTD24 YTD23 Cash and due from banks 6,234 4,922 5,230 5,556 5,183 5,421 5,390 Interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks 102,231 111,550 100,611 102,257 98,767 101,883 102,762 Interest-bearing deposits with banks 9,354 12,139 10,559 11,210 12,287 11,162 14,129 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 36,164 28,900 31,183 29,013 26,915 29,079 26,187 Total available funds 153,983 157,511 147,583 148,036 143,152 147,545 148,468 Total available funds as a percentage of total assets 36 38 35 36 36 36 36 

Total available funds were 154.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 157.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by higher federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. 
 
 Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, commercial paper and other borrowed funds, were 19.8 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 27.0 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease primarily reflects lower federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements and lower trading liabilities. 
 
 Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were 141.0 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 120.8 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Average interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from our European-based businesses included in the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, were 92.8 

billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 88.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The changes primarily reflect client activity. 
 
 Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were 12.4 billion for the first nine months of 2024 and 15.1 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity and market volatility. 
 
 Average long-term debt was 31.9 billion for the first nine months of 2024 and 31.1 billion for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 49.0 billion for the first nine months of 2024 from 61.4 billion for the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting client activity. 
 
 A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services business segments would reduce our access to deposits. See Asset/liability management for additional factors that could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity 
 
 The Parent s major sources of liquidity are access to the debt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise made available in business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a committed credit facility with our intermediate holding company IHC ). 
 
 Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as follows: 
 
 Credit ratings at Sept. 30, 2024

 NR Not rated. 

Long-term debt totaled 33.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Issuances totaling 5.0 billion and an increase in the fair value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset by maturities and redemptions of 3.5 billion. Long-term debt of 1.7 billion will mature in the remainder of 2024. 
 
 The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and certificates of deposit CDs ). At Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, 1.8 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively, of notes were outstanding. At Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, 1.3 billion and 397 million, respectively, of CDs were outstanding. 
 
 The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment. There was 301 million of commercial paper outstanding at Sept. 30, 2024. There was no commercial paper 

outstanding at Dec. 31, 2023. The average commercial paper outstanding was 815 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 4 million for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Subsequent to Sept. 30, 2024, our U.S. bank subsidiaries could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately 1.3 billion, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In addition, at Sept. 30, 2024, non-bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of approximately 4.5 billion. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in Supervision and Regulation Capital Planning and Stress Testing Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions and in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in place for funding purposes that is guaranteed by the 

BNY 33 

Parent for 300 million. There were no borrowings under this line in the third quarter of 2024. Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of BNY, has two separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to 261 million in aggregate. Average borrowings under these lines were less than 1 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a company s cash flows in order to service interest payments and debt maturities. BNY s double leverage ratio is managed in a range considering the high level of unencumbered available liquid assets held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit placements and government securities), the Company s cash generating fee-based business model, with fee revenue representing 73 of total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, and the dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was 120.4 at Sept. 30, 2024 and 120.5 at Dec. 31, 2023, and within the range targeted by management. 
 
 Uses of funds 
 
 The Parent s major uses of funds are repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries. 
 
 In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12 increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from 0.42 to 0.47 per share. The increased quarterly cash dividend was paid on Aug. 2, 2024. Our common stock dividend payout ratio was 32 for the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased 11.1 million common shares at an average price of 65.10 per common share, for a total cost of 725 million. 
 
 Liquidity coverage ratio LCR 
 
 U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain banking organizations, including BNY, to maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered high- 

quality liquid assets HQLA sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon. 
 
 The following table presents BNY s consolidated HQLA, and the average HQLA and average LCR.

 (c) Consolidated HQLA presented before adjustments. After haircuts and the impact of trapped liquidity, consolidated HQLA totaled 135 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 148 billion at June 30, 2024, and averaged 131 billion for the third quarter of 2024 and 137 billion for the second quarter of 2024. 

BNY and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least 100 throughout the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net stable funding ratio NSFR 
 
 The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to large U.S. banking organizations, including BNY. The NSFR is expressed as a ratio of the available stable funding to the required stable funding amount over a one-year horizon. Our average consolidated NSFR was 132 for the third quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2024. 
 
 BNY and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries were compliant with the NSFR requirement of at least 100 throughout the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Statement of cash flows 
 
 The following summarizes the activity reflected on the consolidated statement of cash flows. While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the 

34 BNY 

discussion related to liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity. 
 
 Net cash used for operating activities was 863 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 8.0 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, cash flows used for operations primarily resulted from changes in trading assets and liabilities, partially offset by earnings. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, cash flows provided by operations primarily resulted from earnings and changes in accruals and other, net. 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 11.1 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 4.5 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, net cash used for investing activities primarily resulted from changes in securities, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements and loans, partially offset by changes in interest-bearing 

deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, net cash used for investing activities primarily resulted from changes in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and changes in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by changes in investment securities. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 11.6 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared with net cash used for financing activities of 7.3 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from changes in deposits and net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term debt and treasury stock acquired. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, net cash used for financing activities primarily resulted from changes in payables to customers and broker-dealers and repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term debt, partially offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders equity was 42.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 40.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting earnings and improvements in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by common stock repurchases and divided payments. 

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated other comprehensive income was 774 million at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the net unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, 

BNY 35 

primarily reflects the impact of securities moving closer to maturity and lower market interest rates. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 39.3 million common shares at an average price of 58.92 per common share for a total cost of 2.3 billion. 
 
 In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors providing for the repurchase of up to 5.0 billion of common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This share repurchase plan replaced all previously authorized share repurchase plans. 
 
 In April 2024, we announced a new authorization providing for the repurchase of 6.0 billion of common shares in addition to any remaining capacity under the existing January 2023 authorization. 
 
 In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12 increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock, from 0.42 to 0.47 per share. The increased quarterly cash dividend was paid on Aug. 2, 2024. 
 
 Capital adequacy 
 
 Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank holding companies BHCs and banks, including BNY and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with 

established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding company, our U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY must, among other things, qualify as well capitalized. As of Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, BNY and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were well capitalized. Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including well capitalized status or capital adequacy rules more generally, could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our financial condition. See the discussion of these matters in Supervision and Regulation Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements and Risk Factors Capital and Liquidity Risk Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including well capitalized and well managed status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our business and financial condition, both of which are in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 The U.S. banking agencies capital rules are based on the framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, as amended from time to time. For additional information on these capital requirements, see Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Annual Report.

 (a) Minimum requirements for Sept. 30, 2024 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0 . The stress capital buffer SCB requirement is 2.5 , equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios. 
 (b) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets. 
 (c) The Federal Reserve s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs. 
 (d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures. 
 N/A Not applicable. 

Our CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was 11.9 at Sept. 30, 2024 and 11.5 at Dec. 31, 2023 under the Advanced Approaches. The increase reflects capital generated through earnings and improvements in other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned through common stock repurchases and dividends, and higher risk-weighted assets. 
 
 The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.0 at Sept. 30, 2024 and 6.0 at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase in capital was offset by higher average assets. 
 
 Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance sheet at period end and the levels and types of investments in assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the average size of the balance sheet over the quarter. The balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based on levels of customer and market activity. In general, when servicing clients are more actively trading securities, deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are higher. In addition, when markets experience significant 

volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase considerably as client deposit levels increase. 
 
 Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things, anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any changes BNY may make to its businesses. As a consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may materially change and may be volatile over time and from period to period. 
 
 Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk model is informed by external losses, including fines and penalties levied against institutions in the financial services industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a result, external losses have impacted and could in the future impact the amount of capital that we are required to hold.

Stress capital buffer 
 
 In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY s SCB requirement would remain at 2.5 , equal to the regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2023 through Sept. 30, 2024. The SCB replaced the static 2.5 capital conservation buffer for Standardized Approach capital ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5 capital conservation buffer. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY s SCB requirement would remain at 2.5 , equal to the regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2024 through Sept. 30, 2025. See Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Annual Report for additional information. 
 
 The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess of the distributions in a firm s capital plan, provided that such distributions are consistent with applicable capital requirements and buffers, including the SCB.

 (a) RWA is the greater of Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches. 
 (b) Buffer to be met using only CET1. 
 (c) Buffer to be met using only Tier 1 capital. 

External TLAC consists of the Parent s Tier 1 capital and eligible unsecured LTD issued by it that has a remaining term to maturity of at least one year and satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible LTD consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible 

unsecured debt securities, subject to haircuts for amounts due to be paid within two years, that satisfy certain other conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec. 31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the extent these instruments otherwise would be ineligible only due to containing impermissible acceleration rights or being governed by foreign law. 
 
 The following table presents our external TLAC and external LTD ratios. 
 
 TLAC and LTD ratios Sept. 30, 2024 Minimum required Minimum ratios with buffers Ratios Eligible external TLAC: As a percentage of RWA

 N/A Not applicable. 

If BNY maintains risk-based ratio or leverage TLAC measures above the minimum required level, but with a risk-based ratio or leverage below the minimum level with buffers, we will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and eligible retained income. 

Trading activities and risk management 
 
 Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure through a system of position limits, value-at-risk VaR methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by management and presented below assumes a one-day holding period, utilizes a 99 confidence level and incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide level. 

BNY 39 

VaR represents a key risk management measure, and it is important to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which include: 
 VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme; 
 VaR does not take into account the potential variability of market liquidity; and 
 Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves. 
 
 See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the VaR methodology. 
 
 The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts for the trading portfolio for the designated periods using the historical simulation VaR model.

 N/M Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum and maximum portfolio diversification effect. 

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other interest rate derivative products. 
 
 The foreign exchange component of VaR represents instruments whose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency options and other currency derivative products. 
 
 The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. These instruments include, but are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. 
 
 The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include, but are not limited to, single issuer credit default swaps, and securities with exposures from corporate and municipal credit spreads. 
 
 The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of risk factor movements.

During the third quarter of 2024, interest rate risk generated 45 of average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated 35 of average gross VaR, credit risk generated 18 of average gross VaR and equity risk generated 2 of average gross VaR. During the third quarter of 2024, our daily trading loss did not exceed our calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio. 
 
 The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss illustrates the number of trading days in which our trading revenue or loss fell within particular ranges during the past five quarters. Compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the number of trading days when trading revenue was more than 2.5 million decreased while the number of trading days when trading revenue ranged between 0 and 2.5 million increased, primarily due to lower foreign exchange volumes.

 (a) Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions, derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest income. 

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments. Trading assets were 12.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 10.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. 
 
 Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange and interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments. Trading liabilities were 4.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and 6.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. 
 
 Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts, an initial risk-neutral valuation is performed on each position assuming time discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition, we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our derivatives. 

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our counterparties when measuring the fair value of our derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as those of our counterparties. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, our OTC derivative assets, including those in hedging relationships, of 1.5 billion included a credit valuation adjustment CVA deduction of 13 million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in hedging relationships, of 2.9 billion included a debit valuation adjustment DVA of 4 million related to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA decreased by less than 1 million and the DVA increased by less than 1 million in the third quarter of 2024, which increased investment and other revenue other trading revenue by 1 million. The net impact of the CVA and DVA, net of hedges, decreased investment and other revenue other trading revenue by less than 1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and increased investment and other revenue other trading revenue by less than 1 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The table below summarizes our exposure, net of collateral related to our derivative counterparties, as determined on an internal risk management basis. Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings could alter the level of credit risk faced by BNY.

Asset/liability management 
 
 Our diversified business activities include processing securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities, lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other transactions. The market risks from these activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain 

BNY 41 

foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest rate exposures. 
 
 An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest income between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest income between the scenarios over a 12-month measurement period. 
 
 The baseline scenario incorporates the market s forward rate expectations and management s assumptions regarding client deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes as of each respective quarter-end. These assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ materially from projected results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, and changes in market conditions and management s strategies, among other factors. Client deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting net interest income in the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest rate scenarios. The earnings simulation model assumes static deposit levels and mix, and it also assumes that no management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the average deposit balances of the quarter. 
 
 In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. In each of the scenarios, all currencies interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or lower at the start of the forecast. Long-term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or greater than three years and short-term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months. Interim term points are interpolated where applicable. The impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The results of this earnings simulation should therefore not be extrapolated for more severe interest rate scenarios than those presented in the table below. 

The following table shows net interest income sensitivity for BNY. 
 
 Estimated changes in net interest income 
 (in millions) 
 Sept. 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 Up 100 bps rate shock vs. baseline 
 190 162 166 Long-term up 100 bps, short-term unchanged 
 130 107 13 Short-term up 100 bps, long-term unchanged 
 60 55 153 Long-term down 100 bps, short-term unchanged 
 (139) (109) (14) Short-term down 100 bps, long-term unchanged 
 (124) (135) (214) Down 100 bps rate shock vs. baseline 
 (263) (244) (228) 

At Sept. 30, 2024, the changes in the impacts of a 100 basis points upward or downward shift in rates on net interest income compared with June 30, 2024 were primarily driven by an increase in fixed-rate assets and slightly lower deposit rate sensitivities. 
 
 While the net interest income sensitivity scenario calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate consistent period-over-period comparisons, net interest income is impacted by changes in deposit balances and interest rate trajectory. Noninterest-bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes in short-term rates. 
 
 To illustrate the net interest income sensitivity to noninterest-bearing deposits, we estimate that a 5 billion instantaneous reduction/increase in U.S. dollar-denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce/increase the net interest income sensitivity results in the up 100 basis point rate shock scenario in the table above by approximately 240 million, and in the down 100 basis point rate shock scenario by approximately 140 million. The impact would be smaller if the reduction/increase was assumed to be a mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits. 
 
 Additionally, during periods of low short-term interest rates, money market mutual fund fees and other similar fees are typically waived to protect investors from negative returns. 
 
 For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction of deposits, see Risk Factors Capital and Liquidity Risk Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity in our 2023 Annual Report.

Supplemental information Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures 
 
 BNY has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible common equity Non-GAAP is additional useful information for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income, and the tangible book value per common share Non-GAAP is additional useful information because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. 
 
 BNY has also included revenue measures excluding notable items, including the reduction in the fair value of a contingent consideration receivable related to a prior year divestiture and a disposal gain. Expense measures, excluding notable items, including severance expense, litigation reserves and the FDIC special assessment, are also presented. Litigation reserves represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Net income applicable to common shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, diluted earnings per share, return on common equity, return on tangible common equity and pre-tax operating 

margin, excluding the notable items mentioned above, are also provided. These measures are provided to permit investors to view the financial measures on a basis consistent with how management views the businesses. 
 
 The presentation of the growth rates of investment management and performance fees on a constant currency basis permits investors to assess the significance of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were determined by applying the current period foreign currency exchange rates to the prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture of the related revenue results without the variability caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 BNY has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating margin Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin for the Investment and Wealth Management business segment, net of distribution and servicing expense that was passed to third parties who distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of the Investment and Wealth Management business segment relative to industry competitors.

 Recent accounting developments 
 
 The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has not yet been adopted as of Sept. 30, 2024. 
 
 ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires a public entity to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss (collectively referred to as the significant expense principle ). In addition, disclosure will be required of the title and position of CODM, and how the CODM uses the reported measure of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. 
 
 This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning in 2025, with early adoption permitted. BNY is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on the business segment disclosures. 
 
 ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires a company to disclose, on an annual basis, additional disaggregated information related to the existing disclosures for the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. 
 
 This ASU is effective on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, for annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2025. BNY is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on the income tax disclosures. 

Recent regulatory and other developments 
 
 For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to our operations, see Recent regulatory developments in our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Annual Report. The following discussion summarizes certain regulatory, legislative and other developments that may affect BNY. 
 
 Bank Secrecy Act Extended to Investment Advisers 
 
 On Aug. 28, 2024, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN ), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, adopted a final rule requiring certain investment advisers to establish anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism AML/CFT programs pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act BSA and to monitor for, and report, suspicious activity and currency transactions to FinCEN. Investment advisers will be required to apply their AML/CFT programs to all advisory services provided to all customers, except that they will be permitted to exclude mutual funds, certain bank- and trust company-sponsored collective investment funds, and other investment advisers subject to the rule. Among other requirements, the AML/CFT program must (i) be risk-based, (ii) be reasonably designed to prevent the investment adviser from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit finance activities and to achieve compliance with applicable provisions of the BSA and regulations thereunder, (iii) provide for independent compliance testing, and (iv) designate responsible persons and ongoing training. Investment advisers must comply with the Rule by Jan. 1, 2026. BNY is evaluating the final rule. 
 
 EU Artificial Intelligence Act 
 
 On July 12, 2024, the EU s Regulation on Artificial Intelligence AI Act was published in the Official Journal of the EU and came into force on Aug. 1, 2024. The AI Act will apply extraterritorially, impacting both EU and non-EU entities, and will impact BNY. The AI Act creates a pan-EU regulatory framework to manage the risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence, including with respect to financial services. Under the AI Act, AI systems are categorized into four risk levels depending on their potential to harm individuals or society: unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and 

BNY 47 

minimal risk, and imposes obligations depending on the risk categorization, which may include data governance, documentation and recordkeeping, human oversight, testing, cybersecurity, disclosure, regulatory notification or reporting, or training. In addition, the AI Act prohibits AI that pose unacceptable risk that are abusive or contradict EU values, including AI that may be manipulative, exploitive, or discriminatory. The individual provisions of the AI Act apply on a rolling basis from Feb. 2, 2025 to Aug. 2, 2027. BNY has evaluated the impact of the AI Act and has established an implementation program designed to operationalize the regulatory requirements applicable to BNY within required time frames.

BNY regularly moves assets in and out of its pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve as there have been no borrowings. 
 
 At Dec. 31, 2023, BNY had pledged assets of billion, including billion pledged as collateral for potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and billion pledged as collateral for borrowing at the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Commercial loans 
 
 The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment grade and non-investment grade categories based on the assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally consistent with those of the public rating agencies. Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S P)/Baa3 (Moody s) or better are considered to be investment grade. Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are considered to be non-investment grade. 
 
 Commercial real estate 
 
 Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners and are structured with moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending activities also include construction and renovation facilities. 

Financial institutions 
 
 Financial institution exposures are high quality, with of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating classification at Sept. 30, 2024. In addition, of the financial institutions exposure is secured. For example, securities industry clients and asset managers often borrow against marketable securities held in custody. The exposure to financial institutions is generally short term, with expiring within one year. 
 
 Wealth management loans 
 
 Wealth management loans are not typically rated by external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth management loans are secured by the customers investment management accounts or custody accounts. Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth management loan portfolio, therefore, would equate to investment grade external

at origination. The delinquency rate is a key indicator of credit quality in our wealth management portfolio. At Sept. 30, 2024, less than of the mortgages were past due. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, the wealth management mortgage portfolio consisted of the following geographic concentrations: California ; New York ; Florida ; Massachusetts ; and other . 
 
 Lease financings 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, nearly all of the leasing exposure was investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets. The largest components of our lease residual value exposure relate to real estate and large-ticket transportation equipment. Assets are both domestic and foreign-based, with primary concentrations in Germany and the U.S. 
 
 Other residential mortgages 
 
 The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and 

billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and billion at Dec. 31, 2023. These loans are not typically correlated to external ratings. 
 
 Capital call financing 
 
 Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds that are secured by the fund investors capital commitments and the funds right to call capital. 
 
 Other loans 
 
 Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-income securities. 
 
 Margin loans 
 
 We had billion of secured margin loans at Sept. 30, 2024, compared with billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities, and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral margin in excess of of the value of the loan. We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans. 
 
 Overdrafts 
 
 Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance clients and totaled billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Overdrafts occur on a daily basis and are generally repaid within two business days.

Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to either party s performance under the contracts. 
 
 Contract costs 
 
 Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs result from the payment of sales incentives, primarily in the Wealth Management business, and totaled million at Sept. 30, 2024 and million at Dec. 31, 2023. Capitalized sales incentives are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate.

 Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate directly to an existing contract or a specific anticipated contract, generate or enhance resources that will be used to fulfill performance obligations, and are recoverable. Such costs generally represent set-up costs, which include any direct cost incurred at the inception of a contract which enables the fulfillment of the performance obligation, and totaled

 In accordance with ASU 2023-02, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method , we elected to account for investments in renewable energy projects that met the eligibility requirement using the proportional amortization method on a retrospective basis. Prior to 2024, we used the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV methodology to determine the pre-tax loss that is recognized in each period. This change resulted in an increase in investment and other revenue and an increase in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated income statement beginning in the first quarter of 2024. For additional information, see Note 2 and Note 7.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the balance sheet at Sept. 30, 2024 is accrued interest, where applicable, of million. There was tax expense related to interest for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared with million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. 
 
 It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax positions could decrease within the next 12 months by approximately million as a result of adjustments related to tax years that are still subject to examination.

 Other assets Total assets of consolidated investment management funds Liabilities of consolidated investment management funds: Other liabilities Total liabilities of consolidated investment management funds 

The assets and liabilities of the consolidated investment management funds are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. We value the assets and liabilities of consolidated investment management funds using quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Quoted prices for either identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets may also be used. Accordingly, fair value best reflects the interests BNY holds in the economic performance of the consolidated investment management funds. Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities are recorded as income (loss) from consolidated investment management funds, which is included in investment and other revenue on the consolidated income statement. 
 
 We elected the fair value option on subordinated notes associated with certain equity investments. The fair value of these subordinated notes was million at Sept. 30, 2024 and million at Dec. 31, 2023. The subordinated notes were valued using observable market inputs and included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

 counterparty default losses recorded in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Hedging derivatives 
 
 We utilize interest rate swap agreements, including forward starting swaps, to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair value hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy to reduce fair value variability by converting certain fixed rate interest payments associated with available-for-sale securities, loans and long-term debt to floating interest rates. We also utilize interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes. In designating interest rate swaps as hedges, we utilize both partial-term and full-term hedge strategies. 
 
 The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S. Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS, non-U.S. government and foreign covered bonds. At Sept. 30, 2024, billion par value of available-for-sale securities was hedged with interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had notional values of billion. 
 
 At Sept. 30, 2024, billion of interest rate swaps was designated as portfolio layer method fair value hedges of loans against a closed portfolio of fixed rate

billion, essentially converting billion of such fixed rate loans to a floating rate. 
 
 The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally have original maturities of five to years. In fair value hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with receive fixed rate, pay variable rate swaps. At Sept. 30, 2024, billion par value of debt was hedged with interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had notional values of billion. 
 
 In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposures. We use forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to convert certain forecasted non-U.S. dollar revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars. We use forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of months or less as cash flow hedges to hedge our foreign exchange exposure to currencies such as the Indian rupee, Polish zloty, Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British pound and euro used in revenue and expense transactions for entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As of Sept. 30, 2024, the hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions and designated forward foreign exchange contract hedges were million (notional), with a net pre-tax loss of million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income OCI ). Over the next 12 months, a gain of less than million will be reclassified into earnings. 

From time to time, we have utilized forward foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated with available-for-sale securities. Forward points are designated as an excluded component and amortized into earnings over the hedge period. At Sept. 30, 2024, there were remaining foreign exchange contracts. 
 
 Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities of less than . The derivatives employed are designated as hedges of changes in the value of our foreign investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments in shareholders equity, net of tax. At Sept. 30, 2024, forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling billion were designated as net investment hedges. 
 
 From time to time, we also designate non-derivative financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. At Sept. 30, 2024, there were non-derivative financial instruments hedging our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Other trading revenue 

Foreign exchange revenue includes income from purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency forwards, futures and options as well as foreign currency remeasurement. Other trading revenue reflects results from trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and equity securities, and trading and economic hedging activity with non-foreign exchange derivatives. 
 
 We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital investments and deposits, as well as certain investment management fee revenue streams. We also use total return swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the Company s deferred compensation plan whereby the participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to the performance of investments they select. The gains or losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff expense on the consolidated income statement. We recorded a gain of million in the third quarter of 2024, a loss of million in the third quarter of 2023 and gains of million in the first nine months of 2024 and million in the first nine months of 2023. There wa s impact in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 We manage trading risk through a system of position limits, a value-at-risk VaR methodology based on 

historical simulation and other market sensitivity measures. Risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a separate unit, independent from trading, on a daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VaR methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading positions. The calculation assumes a one -day holding period, utilizes a confidence level and incorporates non-linear product characteristics. The VaR model is one of several statistical models used to develop economic capital results, which are allocated to lines of business for computing risk-adjusted performance. 
 
 VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio and management s assessment of market conditions. Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios. VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk management materials. 
 
 Counterparty credit risk and collateral 
 
 We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through regular examination of their financial statements, confidential communication with the management of those counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available credit rating information. This and other information are used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to assess credit quality. 
 
 Collateral requirements are determined after a comprehensive review of the credit quality of each counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities. Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily. 
 
 Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial instruments are provided in Note 15.

BNY s repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions primarily encounter risk associated with liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based on predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were to experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral pledged for these transactions, we could be required to provide additional collateral to the 

counterparty, therefore decreasing the amount of assets available for other liquidity needs that may arise. BNY also offers tri-party collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market where we are exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value of any collateral. 
 
 Since many of the lending commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A summary of lending commitment 

billion in less than one year, billion in one to five years and million over five years. 
 
 SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients and were collateralized with cash and securities of million at Sept. 30, 2024 and million at Dec. 31, 2023. At Sept. 30, 2024, billion of the SBLCs will expire within one year and million in one to five years. SBLCs expire in over five years. 
 
 We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair value of the liability, which was recorded with a corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-related commitments. 
 
 Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using both historical performance and internal ratings criteria. BNY s historical experience is that SBLCs typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below investment grade are monitored closely for payment/performance risk. 
 
 Non-investment grade 

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commercial letters of credit totaled million at Sept. 30, 2024 and million at Dec. 31, 2023. 
 
 We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the transaction, including

million at Sept. 30, 2024 and million at Dec. 31, 2023. 
 
 A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under the terms of a prearranged contract. 
 
 We typically lend securities with indemnification against borrower default. We generally require the borrower to provide collateral with a minimum value of of the fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are generally entered into only with highly rated counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were secured by collateral of billion at Sept. 30, 2024 and billion at Dec. 31, 2023. 
 
 CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CIBC ), engages in securities lending activities. CIBC Mellon, BNY and CIBC jointly and severally indemnify securities lenders against specific types of borrower default. At Sept. 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, billion and billion, respectively, of borrowings at CIBC Mellon, for which BNY acts as agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, were secured by collateral of billion and billion, respectively. If, upon a default, a borrower s collateral was not sufficient to cover its related obligations, certain losses related to the indemnification could be covered by the indemnitors. 
 
 Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements 
 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase agreements, BNY advances cash to and receives securities as collateral from the counterparty at settlement. These transactions are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet on the 

settlement date. At Sept. 30, 2024, we had unsettled repurchase agreements and billion of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements. At Dec. 31, 2023, we had unsettled repurchase agreements and billion of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements.

Stanford International Bank, also controlled by Stanford, issued certificates of deposit CDs ). Some investors allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to purchase CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed putative class action proceedings against Pershing: in November 2009 in Texas federal court, and in May 2016 in New Jersey federal court. On Nov. 5, 2021, the court dismissed the class action filed in New Jersey. Both matters have concluded. lawsuits remain against Pershing in Louisiana and New Jersey federal courts, which were filed in January 2010, October 2015 and May 2016. The purchasers allege that Pershing, as SGC s clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent scheme and assert contractual, statutory and common law claims. In March 2019, a group of investors filed a putative class action against The Bank of New York Mellon in New Jersey federal court, making the same allegations as in the prior actions brought against Pershing. On Nov. 12, 2021, the court dismissed the class action against The Bank of New York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022, an appeals court reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. On June 28, 2024, an unincorporated association that claims to represent the interests of Stanford investors filed a lawsuit in New Jersey federal court against The Bank of New York Mellon, making the same allegations as prior cases. All of the cases that have been brought in federal court have been consolidated in Texas federal court for discovery purposes. Various alleged Stanford CD purchasers asserted similar claims in Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. FINRA arbitration proceedings.

On April 18, 2018, the court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. On Aug. 4, 2021, the appellate court overturned the dismissal and returned the lawsuit to the lower court. On April 11, 2022, DTVM appealed the Aug. 4 decision to Brazil s Superior Court of Justice. On Aug. 21, 2023, DTVM s appeal was denied. In addition, the 

Tribunal de Contas da Uni o TCU ), an administrative tribunal, has initiated proceedings with the purpose of determining liability for losses to investment funds administered by DTVM in which Postalis was an investor. On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU rendered a decision in of the proceedings, finding DTVM and former Postalis directors jointly and severally liable for approximately million. TCU also imposed on DTVM a fine of approximately million. DTVM s administrative appeal of the decision was denied. On Feb. 25, 2022, DTVM filed a lawsuit in Brazil federal court in Brasilia seeking annulment of TCU s decision and an injunction preventing TCU from enforcing the judgment. On Aug. 24, 2022, the Brazilian Federal Attorneys filed an action in Rio de Janeiro court seeking to enforce the fine portion of the judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022, the Brasilia federal court in the annulment action granted DTVM s request for an injunction, suspending the Sept. 9, 2020, TCU decision until the annulment action is decided.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

 Disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with participation by the members of the Disclosure Committee, has responsibility for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining, and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and that information required to be disclosed by BNY is accumulated and communicated to BNY s management to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. In addition, our ethics hotline can also be used by employees and others for the anonymous communication of concerns about financial controls or reporting matters. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may routinely modify, upgrade or enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Forward-looking Statements 

Some statements in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking. These include statements about the usefulness of Non-GAAP measures, the future results of BNY, our businesses, financial, liquidity and capital condition, results of operations, liquidity, risk and capital management and processes, goals, strategies, outlook, objectives, expectations (including those regarding our performance results, expenses, nonperforming assets, products, impacts of currency fluctuations, impacts of securities portfolio repositioning, impacts of trends on our businesses, regulatory, technology, market, economic or accounting developments and the impacts of such developments on our businesses, legal proceedings and other contingencies), human capital management (including related ambitions, objectives, aims and goals), effective tax rate, net interest income, estimates (including those regarding expenses, losses inherent in our credit portfolios and capital ratios), intentions (including those regarding our capital returns and expenses, including our investments in technology and pension expense), targets, opportunities, potential actions, acquisition and related integration activity, transition to a platforms operating model, growth and initiatives. 
 
 In this report, any other report, any press release or any written or oral statement that BNY or its executives may make, words, such as estimate, forecast, project, anticipate, likely, target, expect, intend, continue, seek, believe, plan, goal, could, should, would, may, might, will, strategy, synergies, opportunities, trends, momentum, ambition, aspiration, objective, aim, future, potentially, outlook and words of similar meaning, may signify forward-looking statements. 
 
 These forward-looking statements, and other forward-looking statements contained in other public disclosures of BNY, are not guarantees of future results or occurrences, are inherently uncertain and are based upon current beliefs and expectations of future events, many of which are, by their nature, difficult to predict, outside of our control and subject to change. By identifying these statements in this manner, we are alerting investors to the possibility that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors, including those factors described in Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report, such as: 

errors or delays in our operational and transaction processing, or those of third parties, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation; 
 our risk management framework, models and processes may not be effective in identifying or mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses and any inadequacy or lapse in our risk management framework, models and processes could expose us to unexpected losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition; 
 a communications or technology disruption or failure within our infrastructure or the infrastructure of third parties that results in a loss of information, delays our ability to access information or impacts our ability to provide services to our clients may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 a cybersecurity incident, or a failure in our computer systems, networks and information, or those of third parties, could result in the theft, loss, disclosure, use or alteration of information, unauthorized access to or loss of information, or system or network failures. Any such incident or failure could adversely impact our ability to conduct our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses; 
 we are subject to extensive government rulemaking, policies, regulation and supervision that impact our operations. Changes to and introduction of new rules and regulations have compelled, and in the future may compel, us to change how we manage our businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm our businesses or reputation; 
 our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate employees; 
 a failure or circumvention of our controls, policies and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation; 

BNY 103 

Forward-looking Statements (continued) 

weakness and volatility in financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 we are dependent on fee-based business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our fee-based revenues could be adversely affected by slowing market activity, weak financial markets, underperformance and/or negative trends in savings rates or in investment preferences; 
 levels of and changes in interest rates have impacted, and will in the future continue to impact, our profitability and capital levels, at times adversely; 
 we have experienced, and may continue to experience, unrealized or realized losses on securities related to volatile and illiquid market conditions, reducing our capital levels and/or earnings; 
 reform of interest rate benchmarks and the use of alternative reference rates by us and our clients could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant clients or counterparties, many of whom are major financial institutions or sovereign entities, and our assumption of credit, counterparty and concentration risk, could expose us to credit losses and adversely affect our business; 
 we could incur losses if our allowance for credit losses, including loan and lending-related commitment reserves, is inadequate or if our expectations of future economic conditions deteriorate; 
 our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity; 
 failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including well capitalized and well managed status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our business and financial condition; 
 the Parent is a non-operating holding company and, as a result, is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC to meet its obligations, including with respect to its securities, and to provide funds for share repurchases, payment of income taxes and payment of dividends to its stockholders; 

our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations, including those governing capital and capital planning, applicable provisions of Delaware law and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock; 
 any material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our principal bank subsidiaries, The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, N.A. or The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, could increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on the value of the securities we issue; 
 the application of our Title I preferred resolution strategy or resolution under the Title II orderly liquidation authority could adversely affect the Parent s liquidity and financial condition and the Parent s security holders; 
 new lines of business, new products and services or transformational or strategic project initiatives subject us to new or additional risks, and the failure to implement these initiatives could affect our results of operations; 
 we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability; 
 our strategic transactions present risks and uncertainties and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse events, publicity, government scrutiny or other reputational harm; 
 ESG concerns, including climate change, could adversely affect our business, affect client activity levels, subject us to additional regulatory requirements and damage our reputation; 
 impacts from geopolitical events, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the physical effects of climate change, pandemics and other similar events may have a negative impact on our business and operations; 
 tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income, effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition; and 

104 BNY 

Forward-looking Statements (continued) 

changes in accounting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements and future events could have a material impact on our reported financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and other financial data. 
 
 Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider all risk factors discussed in the 2023 Annual Report and any subsequent reports filed with the SEC by BNY pursuant to the Exchange Act. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and BNY undertakes no obligation to update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such forward-looking statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The contents of BNY s website or any other website referenced herein are not part of this report.

 Share repurchases may be executed through open market repurchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including through repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions. The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the common stock trading price; the Company s capital position, liquidity and 

financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.
