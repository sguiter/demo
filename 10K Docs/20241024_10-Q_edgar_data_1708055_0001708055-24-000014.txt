Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are unknown and/or difficult to predict and that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unpredictable fluctuations in quarterly revenue and operating results; the impact of restructuring and cost-containment activities; increases in tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products; supply chain disruptions resulting from component availability and/or geopolitical instabilities and disputes (including those related to the wars in Israel and Ukraine); the closure, on a temporary basis, of our offices or those of our contract manufacturer in Israel as a result of the war and the impact of military call-ups of our employees in Israel; material litigation; the impact of fluctuations in interest rates; material cybersecurity and data intrusion incidents, including any security breaches resulting in the theft, transfer, or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee, or company information; our ability to comply with applicable domestic and foreign information security and privacy laws, regulations and technology platform rules or other obligations related to data privacy and security; failure to compete successfully against telecommunications equipment and networking companies; failure to grow our customer base or generate recurring business from our existing customers; credit risks; the timing of customer purchasing decisions and our recognition of revenues; macroeconomic conditions, including inflation; our ability to adapt to rapid technological and market changes; our ability to generate positive returns on our research and development; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and obtain necessary licenses; our ability to maintain partner, reseller, distribution and vendor support and supply relationships; the potential for defects in our products; risks related to the terms of our credit agreement; higher risks in international operations and markets; currency fluctuations; unanticipated adverse changes in legal, regulatory or tax laws; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and/or failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures. We therefore caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements are also discussed in Part I, Item 2, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Part I, Item 1A and Part II, Item 7A, "Risk Factors" and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," respectively, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Potential dilutive common shares Weighted average shares outstanding diluted Options to purchase the Company s common stock and unvested restricted and performance-based stock units aggregating million and million shares were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive. On March 28, 2023, the Company issued shares of newly designated Series A Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") to investors in a private placement offering at a price of per share, along with million warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the "Private Placement"), at the exercise price of per share. The proceeds from the Private Placement were approximately million, including approximately million from existing related party stockholders (See Note 11). On June 25, 2024, the Company redeemed the Preferred Stock with a portion of the proceeds from its refinancing of the 2020 Credit Facility at a rate of for a total of approximately million. The Warrants remain outstanding and without modification. See Note 9 for a description of the refinancing of the 2020 Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the potential number of dilutive shares from the Warrants totaled million shares. However, there was no impact on weighted average shares outstanding from these Warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as the average share price of the Company s common stock was below the exercise price of per share and their effect would have been antidilutive. Dividends accrued on the Preferred Stock were not an adjustment to net income (loss) used for the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share as these dividends were included in the fair value adjustment of the Preferred Stock which was reflected in Other (expense) income, net until the redemption of the Preferred Stock on June 25, 2024.

 Accumulated impairment losses million and million, respectively, had a fair value of approximately million and million, respectively. The Company s Warrant liability had a fair value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s Preferred Stock had a fair value of million as of December 31, 2023 and was fully redeemed on June 25, 2024. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tier fair value hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1. Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company had no assets or liabilities fair valued using Level 1 input at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Level 2. Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets). At December 31, 2023, the Company determined the fair value of its defined benefit plans assets using Level 2 input. There were no significant changes to the Company s defined benefit plans assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that required the calculation of their fair value as of September 30, 2024. Level 3. Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 input was used to determine the fair value of the Company s Warrants at September 30, 2024 and the fair value of the Company s Preferred Stock and Warrants at December 31, 2023.

Restructuring and related expense includes restructuring expense (primarily severance and related costs), estimated future variable lease costs for vacated properties with no intent or ability of sublease, and accelerated rent amortization expense. For restructuring events that involve lease assets and liabilities, the Company applies lease reassessment and modification guidance and evaluates the right-of-use assets for potential impairment. If the Company plans to exit all or distinct portions of a facility and does not have the ability or intent to sublease, the Company will accelerate the amortization of each of those lease components through the vacate date. The accelerated amortization is recorded as a component of Restructuring and related expense in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Related variable lease expenses will continue to be expensed as incurred through the vacate date, at which time the Company will reassess the liability balance to ensure it appropriately reflects the remaining liability associated with the premises and record a liability for the estimated future variable lease costs. Accelerated amortization of lease assets is recognized from the date that the Company commences the plan to fully or partially vacate a facility, for which there is no intent or ability to enter into a sublease, through the final vacate date. Accelerated amortization of lease assets that are included as a component of restructuring and related expense are excluded from the restructuring accrual activity tables below, as the liability for lease payments for these facilities is included as a component of current and noncurrent Operating lease liabilities in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (see Note 16). The Company may incur additional future expense if it is unable to sublease other locations included in the Company s facilities consolidation initiatives.

The Sixth Amendment, among other things, increased the Maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Facility), for the first, second and third quarters of 2023 to :1.00. In the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, the Maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio declined to :1.00 and :1.00, respectively. Also, the Sixth Amendment reduced the minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Facility) to :1.00 through the first quarter of 2024. The Sixth Amendment reduced the maximum borrowings allowed under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility from million to million and the sublimit available for letters of credit was reduced from million to million. In addition, the Sixth Amendment replaced LIBOR with SOFR as the alternative rate available to the Company for calculating interest owed under the 2020 Credit Facility with the margin fixed at . In conjunction with the Sixth Amendment, the Company made a million prepayment that was applied to the final payment due upon maturity in March 2025. The million prepayment was almost entirely funded with the net proceeds from the Private Placement and the sales of the Company s interest rate swap. Debt issuance costs associated with the Sixth Amendment totaled million and were being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the 2020 Credit Facility and were written off in conjunction with the early extinguishment of the 2020 Credit Facility on June 21, 2024. The Company s interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 under the 2020 Term Loan benefited from a hedge instrument that was in place, specifically a fixed rate swap, until it was sold in March 2023 (see Note 10). Following the sale of the fixed rate swap in March 2023, the Company s interest rate was based upon U.S. dollar SOFR plus a fixed margin of . The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the 2020 Credit Facility at December 31, 2023, including the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio calculation that considered the Company s debt to include Preferred Stock.

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility were undrawn at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility and the 2020 Credit Facility have variable interest rates based on SOFR (see Note 9). As a result of exposure to interest rate movements, during March 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement, which effectively converted its million term loan with its variable interest rate based upon one-month LIBOR to an aggregate fixed rate of , plus a leverage-based margin as defined in the 2020 Credit Facility. On July 22, 2022, the Company sold million of the notional amount of its interest rate swap back to its counterparty for million, reducing the notional amount of this swap to million. On August 16, 2022, the Company sold another million of the notional amount of its interest rate swap back to its counterparty for million, reducing the notional amount to million, which approximated the current level of our term loan debt then outstanding. The gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to the million notional amount sold of million was being released into earnings on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the 2020 Credit Facility as a decrease to interest expense until it was refinanced on June 21, 2024, the amortization of which totaled million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining unamortized gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of approximately million was written off to interest expense in conjunction with the refinancing of the 2020 Credit Facility on June 21, 2024. See Note 9 for a description of the refinancing. On March 24, 2023, the Company received million, consisting of million of interest and million for the sale of million of its million notional amount interest rate swap back to its counterparty, reducing the notional amount to million. On March 27, 2023, the Company received million, consisting of million of interest and million for the sale of the remaining million of its interest rate swap back to its counterparty. The portion of the gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to the term loan debt prepaid on the date of

 million and was released into earnings immediately as Other expense, net. The portion of the gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to our remaining term loan debt balance was million and was being released into earnings on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the 2020 Credit Facility as a decrease to interest expense until it was refinanced on June 21, 2024, the amortization of which totaled million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining unamortized gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of million was written off to interest expense in conjunction with the refinancing of the 2020 Credit Facility on June 21, 2024. See Note 9 for a description of the refinancing. The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives have been to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company has used an interest rate swap as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the related agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of designated derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, such a derivative was used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the outstanding borrowings under the 2020 Credit Facility and the Company accounted for this derivative as an effective hedge until the final portion of the swap was sold on March 27, 2023. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative would have been recognized directly in earnings. However, there was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded over the life of the swap. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the Company s derivative are reclassified to interest expense as interest is accrued on the Company s variable-rate debt. Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to other expense, net upon sale of swap, net of tax ) Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense ) ) ) Unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate swap, net of reclassifications and amortization ) ) ) The Company had derivative assets or liabilities at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. shares of Preferred Stock to investors in the Private Placement at a price of per share, along with Warrants with an exercise price of per share.

 for a total of approximately million. The Warrants remain outstanding and without modification. See Note 9 for a description of the refinancing of the 2020 Credit Facility. The Company accounted for the Preferred Stock until it was redeemed and continues to account for the Warrants as liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of their specific terms in accordance with ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The fair value option was elected for the Preferred Stock, as the Company considered fair value to best reflect its expected future economic value. These liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date using the same valuation methodology applied upon issuance using current input assumptions. The value of the Preferred Stock was calculated quarterly through March 31, 2024 using the Black-Derman-Toy (BDT) stochastic yield lattice model to capture the optimal timing of repayment, increasing dividend rate and other features and the value of the Warrants is calculated quarterly using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model. Changes in the fair value of the Preferred Stock and the Warrants are reported as Other expense, net in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company determined the fair value of the Warrants using Level 3 input. The key assumptions into the model utilized was as follows as of September 30, 2024: Strike price Risk-free rate Volatility Dividend yield Time to expiration (years) Fair value of Warrant per share The changes in the Company s Preferred Stock and Warrant liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):

The Warrants, which expire March 30, 2027, are immediately exercisable and upon an event such as a merger, consolidation, asset sale or similar change of control, may be exercised and the holders may vote the underlying shares of common stock. In connection with the Private Placement, the Company provided the investors with certain registration rights relating to the Preferred Stock, the Warrants and the shares of the Company s common stock underlying the Warrants, that required the Company to file a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC within 30 days following the closing date of the Private Placement. The registration requirement was completed on May 19, 2023. primary sources: products and services. Product revenue includes the Company s hardware and software that function together to deliver the products essential functionality. Software and hardware are also sold on a standalone basis. Services include customer support (software updates, upgrades and technical support), consulting, design services, installation services and training. Generally, contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, consisting of products and services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are considered distinct. When an arrangement contains more than one performance obligation, the Company will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company utilizes the observable price of goods and services when they are sold separately to similar customers in order to estimate standalone selling price. The Company s software licenses typically provide a perpetual right to use the Company s software. The Company also sells term-based software licenses that expire and Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS")-based software which are referred to as subscription arrangements. The Company does not customize its software nor are installation services required, as the customer has a right to utilize internal resources or a third-party service company. The software and hardware are delivered before related services are provided and are functional without professional services or customer support. The Company has concluded that its software licenses are functional intellectual property that are distinct, as the user can benefit from the software on its own. Product revenue is typically recognized upon transfer of control or when the software is made available for download, as this is the point the user of the software can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the functional intellectual property. The Company begins to recognize software revenue related to the renewal of subscription software licenses at the start of the subscription period. The Company offers warranties on its products. Certain of the Company s warranties are considered to be assurance-type in nature, ensuring the product is functioning as intended. Assurance-type warranties do not represent separate performance obligations. The Company also sells separately-priced maintenance service contracts which qualify as service-type warranties and represent separate performance obligations. The Company does not allow and has no history of accepting product returns. Services revenue includes revenue from customer support and other professional services. Customer support includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, integrated web-based support and bug fixes or patches. The Company sells its customer support contracts at a percentage of list or net product price. Customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically .

 Significant Judgments The Company s contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to the customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price ("SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products

The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations made in the pending cases and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits; however, the Company is currently unable to forecast the ultimate outcome of these or similar matters. Since it is difficult to predict the outcome of legal proceedings, it is possible that the ultimate outcomes could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Accordingly, with respect to these proceedings, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss. Miller Complaint. On November 8, 2018, Ron Miller, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a Class Action Complaint (the "Miller Complaint") in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the "Massachusetts District Court") against the Company and of its former officers (collectively, the "Defendants"), claiming to represent a class of purchasers of Sonus common stock during the period from January 8, 2015 through March 24, 2015 and alleging violations of the federal securities laws. Similar to a previous complaint entitled Sousa et al. vs. Sonus Networks, Inc. et al., which was dismissed with prejudice by an order dated June 6, 2017, the Miller Complaint claims that the Defendants made misleading forward-looking statements concerning Sonus expected fiscal first quarter of 2015 financial performance, which statements were also the subject of an August 7, 2018 Securities and Exchange Commission Cease and Desist Order, whose findings the Company neither admitted nor denied. The Miller plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. After the Miller Complaint was filed, several parties filed and briefed motions seeking to be selected by the Massachusetts District Court to serve as a Lead Plaintiff in the action. On June 21, 2019, the Massachusetts District Court appointed a group as Lead Plaintiffs and the Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 19, 2019. On August 30, 2019, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Miller Complaint and, on October 4, 2019, the Lead Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss. There was an oral argument on the motion to dismiss on February 12, 2020, and on October 20, 2022 the court denied the motion to dismiss. In June 2023, the Defendants agreed to a settlement in principle with the named plaintiffs, and final approval of the settlement was provided by the court on April 24, 2024. The settlement provided a release of all claims asserted in the litigation to all Defendants, who continue to deny liability. The million settlement amount was funded by the provider of the Company s Directors and Officers liability insurance policy.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Ribbon Communications Inc. should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2024. Overview We are a leading global provider of communications technology to service providers and enterprises. We provide a broad range of software and high-performance hardware products, network solutions, and services that enable the secure delivery of data and voice communications, and high-bandwidth networking and connectivity for residential consumers and for small, medium, and large enterprises and industry verticals such as finance, education, government, utilities, and transportation. Our mission is to create a recognized global technology leader providing cloud-centric solutions that enable the secure exchange of information, with unparalleled scale, performance and elasticity. We are headquartered in Plano, Texas, and have a global presence with research and development or sales and support locations in over thirty countries around the world. Key Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ribbon Supplier Disruptions. Ongoing uncertainty in the global economy due to inflation, the wars in Israel and Ukraine, national security concerns and other factors, continue to disrupt various manufacturing, commodity and financial markets, increase volatility, and impede global supply chains. Our ability to deliver our solutions as agreed upon with our customers depends in part on the ability of our global contract manufacturers, vendors, licensors and other business partners to deliver products or perform services we have procured from them. Continued uncertain global economic conditions may cause our customers to restrict spending or delay purchases for an indeterminate period of time and consequently cause our revenues to decline. Further, such factors may negatively impact our operating costs resulting in a reduction in net income. The degree to which the ongoing wars in Israel and Ukraine and the inflationary and high interest rate environment impacts our future business, financial position and results of operations will depend on developments beyond our control. The Ongoing Wars in Israel and Ukraine . The uncertainty resulting from the wars in Israel and Ukraine and the expansion of, and the threat of continued expansion of, one or both of these wars could result in some of our customers delaying purchases from us. As a result of safety concerns, we may close our offices in Israel from time to time. Although our employees in these offices have the ability to work remotely and business continuity plans are in place to address any medium- or long-term disruptions that could result from the closure of these offices, the office closures and general effects of employees operating in a region at war could have a negative impact on our operations. Further, a number of our employees in Israel are members of the military reserves and subject to immediate call-up in response to the war in Israel. Following the terrorist attacks in Israel in October 2023, a number of our employees have been activated for military duty and we expect that additional employees will also be activated if the war in Israel continues. While we have business continuity plans in place to address the military call-ups, it could affect the timing of projects in the short-term as the work is shifted to other team members both inside and outside of Israel. Further, the U.S. and other European countries have imposed sanctions and trade restrictions against Russia in connection with the war in Ukraine. These sanctions and restrictions currently prohibit our ability to sell hardware products. The sanctions continue to evolve and further changes in the current sanctions or trade restrictions could further limit our ability to sell products and services to customers in Russia and, our ability to collect on outstanding accounts receivable from such customers. If we are further limited in our ability to sell products and services to Russia and other countries for an extended period, it could have a material impact on our financial results.

 Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures driving up energy prices, component costs, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to be decreasing, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets. However, in September 2024, the Federal Reserve s Federal Open Market Committee lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5 to 4.75 to 5 , noting that it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainability toward the Committee s two percent objective. Yet, the economic outlook remains uncertain, and the implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for our business. Presentation Unless otherwise noted, all financial amounts, excluding tabular information, in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") are rounded to the nearest million dollar amount, and all percentages, excluding tabular information, are rounded to the nearest percentage point. Operating Segments Our Chief Operating Decision Maker assesses our performance based on the performance of two separate organizations within Ribbon: the Cloud and Edge operating segment ("Cloud and Edge") and the IP Optical Networks operating segment ("IP Optical Networks"). For additional details regarding our operating segments, see Note 13 - Operating Segment Information to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Financial Overview Financial Results We reported a loss from operations of 0.9 million and income from operations of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We reported a loss from operations of 16.3 million and 41.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our revenue was 210.2 million and 203.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross profit and gross margin were 109.6 million and 52.1 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 103.5 million and 50.9 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The higher revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is due to 12.3 million of higher Cloud and Edge sales, primarily to U.S. service providers and Federal agencies, partially offset by 5.2 million of lower IP Optical Networks sales led by lower sales into Eastern Europe and India, which were partially offset by growth in the U.S. rural market. Our revenue was 582.5 million and 599.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross profit and gross margin were 299.4 million and 51.4 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 286.4 million and 47.7 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is due to 15.2 million of lower Cloud and Edge sales to both U.S. service providers and enterprise customers overall, partially offset by higher Federal agency sales, and 2.2 million of lower IP Optical Networks sales. Revenue from our Cloud and Edge segment was 128.1 million and 115.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit and gross margin for this segment were 84.3 million and 65.9 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 74.7 million and 64.6 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from our Cloud and Edge segment was 340.3 million and 355.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit and gross margin for this segment were 219.2 million and 64.4 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 220.1 million and 61.9 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenue from our IP Optical Networks segment was 82.2 million and 87.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit and gross margin for this segment were 25.3 million and 30.8 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 28.8 million and 32.9 , respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from our IP Optical Networks segment was 242.2 million and 244.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit and gross margin for this segment were 80.2 million and 33.1 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 66.2 million and 27.1 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our operating expenses were 110.5 million and 102.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 315.8 million and 327.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increased operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 are primarily related to a 5.0 million legal settlement and associated legal fees related to certain specific legal matters. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets, and 3.8 million of restructuring and related expense. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 7.2 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets, 0.8 million of acquisition-, disposal- and integration-related expense, and 2.7 million of restructuring and related expense. The decreased operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 are primarily related to lower restructuring and related expense, acquisition-, disposal- and integration-related expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 19.7 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets, and 8.8 million of restructuring and related expense. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 21.7 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets, 3.0 million of acquisition-, disposal- and integration-related expense, and 13.9 million of restructuring and related expense. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of 4.0 million and 5.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 12.1 million and 16.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included as components of both Cost of revenue and Operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. See "Results of Operations" in this MD A for a discussion of the changes in our revenue and expenses for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring and Cost Reduction Initiatives Our CODM approved workforce reductions in 2024 for certain of our operating locations to correspond with the current sales levels in those areas. We recorded 2.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to these actions. In February 2023, our Board of Directors approved a strategic restructuring program (the "2023 Restructuring Plan") to streamline our operations in order to support our investment in critical growth areas. The 2023 Restructuring Plan includes, among other things, charges related to a workforce reduction. Any potential positions eliminated in countries outside the United States are subject to local law and consultation requirements. In connection with the 2023 Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring and related expense for severance related costs of 0.1 million and 2.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 0.9 million and 9.4 million in three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We anticipate that we will record nominal future expense for severance in connection with the 2023 Restructuring Plan. In February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a strategic restructuring program (the "2022 Restructuring Plan") to streamline our operations in order to support our investment in critical growth areas. The 2022 Restructuring Plan includes, among other things, charges related to a consolidation of facilities and a workforce reduction. Any positions eliminated in countries outside the United States are subject to local law and consultation requirements. In connection with the 2022 Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring and related expense of 1.5 million and 4.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, for variable and other facilities-related costs, and we recorded restructuring and related expense of 1.9 million and 4.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The amount for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was

Table of Contents 
 comprised of 1.7 million for variable and other facilities-related costs and 0.2 million for accelerated amortization of lease assets no longer being used with no ability or intent to sublease. The amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of 3.8 million for variable and other facilities-related costs and 0.8 million for accelerated amortization of lease assets no longer being used with no ability or intent to sublease. We anticipate that we will record approximately 2 million of expense in the remainder of 2024 related to the 2022 Restructuring Plan. For facilities that are part of a restructuring plan, for which we have no intent or ability to enter into a sublease, we recognize accelerated rent amortization over the period from the date that we commence the plan to fully or partially vacate a facility through the final vacate date. We did not record accelerated rent amortization in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded 0.2 million and 0.8 million for accelerated rent amortization in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We continue to evaluate our properties included in our restructuring plans for accelerated amortization and/or right-of-use asset impairment. We may incur additional future expense if we are unable to sublease other locations included in these initiatives. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This MD A is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical include revenue recognition, the valuation of inventory, warranty accruals, loss contingencies and reserves, stock-based compensation, the Preferred Stock and Warrants, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, accounting for leases, and accounting for income taxes. If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024. For a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Results of Operations Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue.

The decrease in our product revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to 13 million of lower sales of our Cloud and Edge products and 7 million of lower sales of our IP Optical Networks products. The increase in revenue from the sale of Cloud and Edge products in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to higher sales to U.S. service providers and Federal agencies. The decrease in revenue from the sale of IP Optical Networks products in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to lower sales into Eastern Europe and India, partially offset by higher sales in the U.S. rural market. The decrease in revenue from the sale of Cloud and Edge products in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to lower sales to both U.S. service providers and enterprise customers overall, partially offset by higher sales to Federal agencies for network transformation projects. The decrease in revenue from the sale of IP Optical Networks products in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to lower sales into India, partially offset by higher sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa the EMEA region ). Revenue from sales to enterprise customers was 36 and 30 of our product revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These sales were made through both our direct sales team and indirect sales channel partners. Revenue from sales to enterprise customers was 39 and 30 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in enterprise sales reflects stronger sales of our products to customers in the Federal agencies. Revenue from indirect sales through our channel partner program was 34 and 33 of our product revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 38 and 34 of our product revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in channel sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects stronger IP Optical Networks deployments through systems integrators as well as sell-thru our service provider channel partners in Eastern Europe. The timing of the completion of customer projects and revenue recognition criteria satisfaction may cause our product revenue to fluctuate from one period to the next. Service revenue is primarily comprised of hardware and software maintenance and support maintenance revenue and network design, installation and other professional services professional services revenue ).

Professional services revenue was higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to increased sales of Cloud and Edge services to U.S. service providers and a U.S. Federal agency for voice modernization projects and growing sales of IP Optical Networks services in the EMEA region. The following customer contributed 10 or more of our revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Networks segments. Due to the timing of project completions, we expect that the domestic and international components as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our deferred product revenue was 13 million and 17 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our deferred service revenue was 100 million and 116 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our deferred revenue balance may fluctuate as a result of the timing of revenue recognition, customer payments, maintenance contract renewals, contractual billing rights and maintenance revenue deferrals included in multiple element arrangements. We expect that our total revenue in 2024 will increase modestly compared to our revenue in 2023 due to growth in the Cloud Edge segment, particularly with the increased purchases from Verizon as part of a voice modernization project, as well as increased sales to Federal agencies, offset by lower revenue from our IP Optical segment. From a regional perspective, we anticipate continued IP Optical Networks revenue growth in 2024 from North America, and EMEA, offset by lower revenue in Eastern Europe due to additional trade restrictions. In the Cloud Edge segment, we expect continued revenue growth from enterprise customers, including U.S. Federal agencies, as well as higher U.S. service provider spending. Cost of Revenue/Gross Margin. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to third-party manufacturers for purchased materials and services, royalties, amortization of acquired technology, inventory valuation adjustments, warranty costs, and manufacturing and services personnel and related costs. Our cost of revenue, gross profit and gross margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

Our gross margin increased 4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a 6 increase in our IP Optical Networks segment and a 3 increase in our Cloud Edge segment. The higher margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in our IP Optical Networks segment was primarily attributable to favorable customer and product mix along with lower material and labor costs. Our Cloud and Edge segment s gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to favorable product mix and lower amortization of acquired technology costs. We expect gross margin in our IP Optical Networks segment to increase slightly in the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect our overall corporate gross margin in 2024 to be slightly higher compared to 2023 due to increased revenue from our Cloud Edge segment and its higher margins due to the higher software content in its products, along with slightly higher margins from our IP Optical Networks segment due to favorable customer and product mix. Research and Development. R D expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses and prototype costs for the design, development, testing, and enhancement of our products. R D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 

Decrease September 30, September 30, from prior year 2024 2023 Three months ended 45,645 46,229 (584) (1.3) Nine months ended 134,897 145,309 (10,412) (7.2) The decrease in our R D expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to lower expenses in both of our segments. However, our IP Optical Networks segment contributed the most to the improvement by decreasing costs by under 1 million and 8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The reduced expenses are a combination

 of lower employee headcount and outside subcontractors resulting from the cost savings implemented in the 2023 Restructuring Plan. Our IP Optical Networks R D investment is focused on significantly expanding our portfolio of IP Routing solutions, adding additional features and capabilities to our Optical Transport portfolio, and supporting features in our next generation SDN management and orchestration platform. Some aspects of our R D efforts require significant short-term expenditures, the timing of which may cause variability in our expenses. We believe that rapid technological innovation is critical to our long-term success, and we are tailoring our investments to meet the requirements of our customers and market. However, we do expect that 2024 R D expenses will be lower than 2023 overall, with reduced investment in both segments in areas such as sustaining engineering, as well as a full year benefit from the cost savings implemented in the 2023 Restructuring Plan. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, commissions, travel and entertainment expenses, promotions, customer trial and evaluations inventory and other marketing and sales support expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 

Increase/(decrease) September 30, September 30, from prior year 2024 2023 Three months ended 33,060 32,795 265 0.8 Nine months ended 100,760 102,099 (1,339) (1.3) The decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily a result of the global sales organization realignment that reduced management layers, as well as reduced investment in under-performing regions, with essentially equal reductions in both of our operating segments. We expect our sales and marketing expenses in 2024 to be similar to 2023 as we continue to benefit from the realigned global sales structure. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for executive and administrative personnel, and audit, legal and other professional fees. General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 

Increase September 30, September 30, from prior year 2024 2023 Three months ended 21,588 12,885 8,703 67.5 Nine months ended 51,680 41,276 10,404 25.2 The increase in general and administrative expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a 5.0 million legal settlement and associated legal fees related to certain specific legal matters, as well as increased employee costs. We believe that our general and administrative expenses in 2024 will increase compared to our 2023 levels primarily due to higher legal fees, settlement expense, employee costs, and as a result of inflation.

 Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets included in Operating expenses. Amortization of acquired intangible assets included in Operating expenses ("Opex Amortization") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 

Decrease September 30, September 30, from prior year 2024 2023 Three months ended 6,457 7,216 (759) (10.5) Nine months ended 19,671 21,740 (2,069) (9.5) Opex Amortization was lower for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We record our amortization in relation to expected future cash flows rather than on a straight-line basis. Accordingly, such expense may vary from one period to the next. Acquisition-, Disposal- and Integration-Related. Acquisition-, disposal- and integration-related expenses include those expenses related to acquisitions that we would otherwise not have incurred. Acquisition- and disposal-related expenses include professional and services fees, such as legal, audit, consulting, paying agent and other fees. Integration-related expenses represent incremental costs related to combining our systems and processes with those of acquired businesses, such as third-party consulting and other third-party services. We recorded no such expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million and 3.0 million of such expenses recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These costs were related to integration following the Company s acquisition of ECI and included license fees for systems in the process of being retired. Restructuring and Related. We have been committed to streamlining our operations and reducing operating costs by closing and consolidating certain facilities and reducing our worldwide workforce. Please see the additional discussion of our restructuring initiatives in the "Restructuring and Cost Reduction Initiatives" section of the Overview of this MD A. We recorded restructuring and related expense of 3.8 million and 2.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 8.8 million and 13.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although we have eliminated positions as part of our restructuring initiatives, we continue to hire in certain areas that we believe are important to our future growth. Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense and interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 

Increase/(decrease) Three months ended from prior year September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Interest income 67 157 (90) (57.0) Interest expense (12,019) (7,300) 4,719 64.7 Interest expense, net (11,952) (7,143) 4,809 67.3 

Increase/(decrease) Nine months ended from prior year September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Interest income 221 273 (52) (19.0) Interest expense (22,039) (20,604) 1,435 7.0 Interest expense, net (21,818) (20,331) 1,487 7.3 Our interest income was nominal in 2024 and 2023. Our interest expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily represents interest, amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, and the amortization of gains in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income from the sales of our interest

 rate swap. Interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher margins under our 2024 Term Loan compared to our 2020 Term Loan, both as defined below. Interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher margins under our 2024 Term Loan compared to our 2020 Term Loan, and higher interest in 2024 due to our interest rate swap no longer being in place, partially offset by write offs related to the refinancing of the 2020 Credit Facility with a portion of the proceeds from the 2024 Credit Facility on June 21, 2024. The write offs related to the refinancing consisted of the remaining unamortized gains in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income from the sales of our interest rate swap totaling 4.9 million, partially offset by the write off of debt issuance costs from the 2020 Credit Facility totaling 2.0 million. Our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from our interest rate swap that fixed our interest rate at 0.904 and was sold in March 2023. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the sale of our interest rate swap. Other (Expense) Income, Net . We recorded other income, net of 1.1 million, and other expense, net of 2.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded other expense, net of 16.0 million and of 0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of the fair value adjustment related to our Warrant liability and foreign currency exchange gains. Other expense in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange losses. Other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of 6.6 million of fair value adjustments, 2.7 million of accrued dividends, and the 1.8 million call premium on our Preferred Stock that we redeemed on June 25, 2024, and foreign currency exchange losses of 1.4 million. Other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange losses of 1.2 million, the 1.6 million fair value adjustment of our Preferred Stock and Warrants, including dividends on the Preferred Stock, and 3.5 million of costs incurred in the Private Placement, partially offset by the gain of 7.3 million recognized from Accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with the sale of our interest rate swap. Income Taxes. We recorded income tax provisions of 1.6 million and 4.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6.5 million and 11.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts reflect our estimates of the effective rates expected to be applicable for the respective full fiscal years, adjusted for any discrete events, which are recorded in the period that they occur. These estimates are reevaluated each quarter based on our estimated tax rate for the full year. The estimated effective tax rate includes the impact of valuation allowances in various jurisdictions. We intend to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the respective allowances. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the "OECD") Pillar 2 global minimum tax rules are intended to apply for tax years beginning in 2024. On February 1, 2023, the FASB staff noted that they believe that the Pillar 2 tax would be an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred tax assets would not need to be recognized related to this parallel taxing system. On February 2, 2023, the OECD issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar 2 global minimum tax. Under an additional transitional safe harbor released July 17, 2023, the undertaxed profits rule top-up tax will not be applied by any constituent entity s jurisdiction of residence with respect to income earned by a company s ultimate parent entity in its jurisdiction of residence, if the ultimate parent entity s jurisdiction has a corporate tax rate of at least 20 . This transition safe harbor will apply to fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 2025 and ending before December 31, 2026. We are closely monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts these new rules will have on our tax rate, including eligibility to qualify for these safe harbor rules and do not expect Pillar 2 to have a significant impact on our financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net loss (60,599) (73,285) 12,686 Adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash flows used in operating activities: 48,393 61,754 (13,361) Changes in operating assets and liabilities 679 8,479 (7,800) Net cash used in operating activities (11,527) (3,052) (8,475) Net cash used in investing activities (14,890) (6,620) (8,270) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 40,177 (32,163) 72,340 We had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash aggregating 40 million and 27 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries aggregating 15 million and 16 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If we elect to repatriate all of the funds held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024, we do not believe that the amounts of potential withholding taxes that would arise from the repatriation would have a material effect on our liquidity. On June 21, 2024, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (the 2024 Credit Facility and 2024 Credit Agreement as guarantor, with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ribbon Communications Operating Company, Inc., as the borrower Borrower ), HPS Investment Partners, LLC ("HPS"), as administrative agent, and HPS and WhiteHorse Capital Management, LLC ("WhiteHorse" and, together with HPS, the "Lenders"), pursuant to which the Lenders provided us with a 385 million senior secured credit facility comprised of (i) a 350 million term loan (the 2024 Term Loan and (ii) a 35 million revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolver ), including a 20 million sublimit for letters of credit. The proceeds received from the 2024 Term Loan were used to (a) repay 100 of the amounts outstanding under the 2020 Credit Facility, (b) redeem in full the Preferred Stock and (c) pay fees and expenses related to the 2024 Credit Facility. Excess proceeds are being used by us for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The 2024 Term Loan and the 2024 Revolver bear interest, at the Borrower s option, at either the Alternate Base Rate ABR or Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") with an Applicable Margin for each (all as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement). Margins for the first six months are 5.25 per annum for ABR Loans and 6.25 per annum for SOFR Loans. Thereafter, margins vary based on our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, ranging from 4.75 to 5.25 per annum for ABR Loans and 5.75 to 6.25 per annum for SOFR Loans. The 2024 Term Loan and the 2024 Revolver will both mature on June 21, 2029. The 2024 Term Loan is being repaid in equal quarterly installments: approximately 0.9 million beginning with the third quarter of 2024 through the second quarter of 2025; approximately 2.2 million beginning with the third quarter of 2025 and ending with the second quarter of 2027; and approximately 4.4 million quarterly thereafter, with the remaining principal balance of approximately 298.4 million due on the maturity date of June 21, 2029. In connection with the establishment of the 2024 Credit Facility, 7.7 million of original issue discount was withheld by the Lenders and we incurred 6.1 million of debt issuance costs for a total of 13.8 million that is being amortized to Interest expense, net over the term of the agreement. Our previous credit facility was the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Credit Agreement (as amended, the "2020 Credit Facility"), which we entered into on March 3, 2020, by and among us, as a guarantor, Ribbon Communications Operating Company, Inc., as the borrower (the "Borrower"), Citizens Bank, N.A., Santander Bank, N.A., and others as lenders, ("2020 Credit Facility Lenders"). For additional details regarding the terms of the 2024 Credit Facility and 2020 Credit Facility, see Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. On March 24, 2023, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the 2020 Credit Facility (the Sixth Amendment effective March 30, 2023. The Sixth Amendment, among other things, increased the Maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Facility), with the first, second and third quarters of 2023 increasing to 

 48 

Table of Contents 
 4.50:1.00. In the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, the Maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio declined to 4.25:1.00 and 4.00:1.00, respectively. Also, the Sixth Amendment reduced the minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Facility) to 1.10:1.00 through the first quarter of 2024. The Sixth Amendment reduced the maximum borrowings allowed under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility from 100 million to 75 million and the sublimit available for letters of credit was reduced from 30 million to 20 million. In addition, the Sixth Amendment replaced LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as the alternative rate that may be used by the Company for calculating interest owed under the 2020 Credit Facility with the margin now fixed at 4.5 . In conjunction with the Sixth Amendment, we made a 75 million prepayment that was applied to the final payment due upon maturity in March 2025. The 75 million prepayment was almost entirely funded with the net proceeds from the Private Placement and the sales of our interest rate swap. Debt issuance costs associated with the Sixth Amendment totaled 1.7 million and were being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the 2020 Credit Facility to Interest expense, net and were written off in conjunction with the early extinguishment of the 2020 Credit Facility on June 21, 2024. The 2020 Credit Facility, as amended, allowed us to incur junior secured or unsecured debt in an amount no less than 50 million, subject to certain conditions, including the requirement that 50 of the aggregate amount of such incurred debt (net of certain costs, fees and other amounts) must be applied to prepay the 2020 Credit Facility and compliance with certain leverage ratio-based covenant exceptions. Quarterly principal payments were required on the 2020 Term Loan aggregating approximately 5.0 million per quarter through March 31, 2024, and if the refinancing had not occurred, 10.0 million would have been required in each of the three quarters thereafter, with the remaining and final payment due on the maturity date in March 2025. At September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding balance under the 2024 Term Loan of 349.1 million at an average interest rate of 11.2 , with no revolver balance and no letters of credit outstanding under our 2024 Credit Facility. Our interest rates under our 2020 Term Loan for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from a hedge instrument that was in place, specifically a fixed rate swap, which was sold in March 2023 (see Note 10). We were in compliance with all covenants of the 2024 Credit Facility and 2020 Credit Facility at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, including the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio calculation under the 2020 Credit Facility that considered our debt to include Preferred Stock. We use letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds in the course of our business. At September 30, 2024, we had 10.4 million of letters of credit, bank guarantees, and surety bonds outstanding (collectively, "Guarantees") under various uncommitted facilities and no letters of credit outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. At December 31, 2023, we had Guarantees aggregating 7.9 million, comprised of 2.7 million of letters of credit under the 2020 Credit Facility described above and 5.2 million of Other Guarantees. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash collateral of 2.9 million and 0.1 million, respectively, supporting the Guarantees, which are reported in Restricted cash in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We are exposed to financial market risk related to foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. These exposures are actively monitored by management. To manage the volatility related to the exposure to changes in interest rates, we may enter into a derivative financial instrument. Management s objective has been to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates. Our policies and practices are to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As a result of exposure to interest rate movements, during March 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement, which effectively converted our 400 million term loan with its variable interest rate based upon one-month LIBOR to an aggregate fixed rate of 0.904 , plus a leverage-based margin as defined in the 2020 Credit Facility. On July 22, 2022, we sold 30 million of the notional amount of our interest rate swap back to our counterparty for 1.5 million, reducing the notional amount of this swap to 370 million. On August 16, 2022, we sold another 30 million of the notional amount of our interest rate swap back to our counterparty for 1.6 million, reducing the notional amount to 340 million, which approximated the term loan debt then outstanding. The gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to the 60 million notional amount sold of 3.1 million was being released into earnings on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the 2020 Credit Facility as a decrease to interest

 expense, the amortization of which totaled 0.4 million and 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining unamortized gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of approximately 0.5 million was written off to interest expense in conjunction with the refinancing of the 2020 Credit Facility on June 21, 2024. On March 24, 2023, we received 9.4 million, consisting of 0.4 million of interest and 9.0 million for the sale of 170 million of its 340 million notional amount interest rate swap back to our counterparty, reducing the notional amount to 170 million. On March 27, 2023, we received 9.8 million, consisting of 0.4 million of interest and 9.4 million for the sale of the remaining 170 million of our interest rate swap back to our counterparty. The portion of the gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to the term loan debt prepaid on the date of the final sale of our swap totaled 7.3 million and was released into earnings immediately as Other expense, net. The portion of the gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to our remaining term loan debt balance totaled 12.0 million and was being released into earnings on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the 2020 Credit Facility as a decrease to interest expense beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the amortization of which was 3.0 million and 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining unamortized gain in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of 4.4 million was written off to interest expense in conjunction with the refinancing of the 2020 Credit Facility on June 21, 2024. Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives have been to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, we have used an interest rate swap as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixed-rate payments over the life of an agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of designated derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, such a derivative was used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the outstanding borrowings under the 2020 Credit Facility and the Company accounted for this derivative as an effective hedge until the final portion of the swap was sold on March 27, 2023. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative would be recognized directly in earnings. However, we recorded no hedge ineffectiveness over the life of our swap. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 7.3 million of Other expense, net due to the sale of our swap. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash flows from operating activities to be affected by increases and decreases in sales volumes and timing of collections, and by purchases and shipments of inventory. Our primary uses of cash for operating activities have been for personnel costs and investment in our research and development and in our sales and marketing, and general and administrative departments. Our operating activities used cash of 11.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of lower deferred revenue, accounts payable, and inventory and our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses. These amounts were partially offset by lower accounts receivable and other operating assets, and higher accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. Our net loss is adjusted for non-cash expenses such as amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and the increase in the fair value of our Preferred Stock liability, partially offset by a 6.7 million one time payment of accumulated dividends as a result of our redemption of our Preferred Stock liability on June 25, 2024 and 8.2 million adjustment for amortization of an accumulated other comprehensive gain related to our interest rate swap and 14.6 million for deferred income tax expense. Higher revenue in our IP Optical Networks segment and lower operating expenses company-wide due to our various cost saving initiatives, including lower employee and facilities expenses, continue to positively affect our operating cash flow. Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 3.1 million was primarily a result of lower accounts payable, accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses, and lower deferred revenue and higher inventory, partially offset by lower accounts receivable and other

Table of Contents 
 operating assets. Higher product revenue in our IP Optical Networks segment and lower operating expenses company-wide due to our various cost saving initiatives, including lower employee and facilities expenses, all positively affected our operating cash flow in 2023. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our investing activities used 14.9 million and 6.6 million of cash to purchase property and equipment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the build out of a new facility in Israel. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our financing activities provided 40.2 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We received 342.3 million of proceeds, net of 7.7 million of original issue discount, from the issuance of term debt under the 2024 Credit Facility that was established on June 21, 2024 to refinance the 2020 Credit Facility. Also, we had 44.1 million of both borrowings and principal payments under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility. In conjunction with the establishment of the 2024 Credit Facility, we repaid the 2020 Term Debt amounting to 235.4 million, redeemed all of the outstanding Preferred Stock totaling 56.9 million, and paid 6.0 million in debt issuance costs. Also, we paid 0.9 million in principal payments on our 2024 Term Debt. In addition, we paid 3.0 million of tax obligations related to the vesting of stock awards and units. Our financing activities used 32.2 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 90.0 million of principal payments on our term debt, including a 75.0 million prepayment in connection with the Sixth Amendment to the 2020 Credit Facility, 1.6 million of debt issuance costs also paid in connection with the Sixth Amendment, and 3.9 million for the payment of tax obligations related to the vesting of stock awards and units. In addition, we received 53.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Stock and Warrants in the Private Placement and had 10.0 million of net borrowings under our 2020 Revolving Credit Facility. The rate at which we consume cash is dependent upon the cash needs of our future operations, including our contractual obligations at September 30, 2024, primarily comprised of our debt principal and interest obligations as described above, and our operating lease and purchase obligations. Our operating lease obligations totaled 52.6 million at September 30, 2024, with payments to be made aggregating 4.6 million in the remainder of 2024, 11.1 million in 2025, 9.3 million in 2026 and 27.6 million thereafter. Estimated payments for purchase obligations for the full year 2024 total approximately 101 million. We anticipate devoting substantial capital resources to continue our R D efforts, to maintain our sales, support and marketing, and for other general corporate activities. We believe that our financial resources, along with managing discretionary expenses, will allow us to manage the ongoing impact of inflation on our business operations. Looking ahead, we have developed contingency plans to reduce costs further if the situation deteriorates. Based on our current expectations, we believe that our current cash balances and available borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which increases the disclosure requirements around rate reconciliation information and certain types of income taxes companies are required to pay. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for us beginning with our 2025 annual financial statements, with early adoption permitted. We expect the adoption of the standard will require certain additional income tax disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ), which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, including enhancement of the disclosures of significant segment expenses and interim disclosure requirements, to enable investors

 to better understand an entity's overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for us beginning with our 2024 annual financial statements and interim financial statements thereafter and will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements. Our adoption of this standard will require certain additional segment disclosures. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Our material legal proceedings as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Note 19, "Commitments and Contingencies," under the heading "Litigation." The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management s expectations, our financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. We settled certain matters during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. There have been no material changes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
