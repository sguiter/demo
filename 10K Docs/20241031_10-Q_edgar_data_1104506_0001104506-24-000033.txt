million in cash and cash equivalents and billion in marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and reported a net loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has funded its operations through public offerings of equity securities, de bt financings and revenue interest financings. The Company expects to continue to incur consolidated operating losses, including losses in its US and certain international entities, while funding research and development (R D) activities for ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP and its other pipeline programs, continuing commercialization and regulatory activities for ARIKAYCE and pre-commercial, regulatory and, if approved, commercialization activities for brensocatib, and funding other general and administrative activities. 
 The Company expects its future cash requirements to be substantial. While the Company currently has sufficient funds to meet its financial needs for at least the next 12 months, the Company may raise additional capital in the future to fund its operations, its ongoing commercialization and clinical trial activities, and its future product candidates, and to develop, acquire, in-license or co-promote other products or product candidates, including those that address orphan or rare diseases. The source, timing and availability of any future financing or other transaction will depend principally upon continued progress in the Company s commercial, regulatory and development activities. Any future financing will also be contingent upon market

 Marketable securities Collateral for interest rate swap Liabilities Interest rate swap Deferred consideration Contingent consideration 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, billion of marketable securities were purchased and million of marketable securities matured , each consisting of US Treasury Notes. 
 The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. The collateral for interest rate swap and the interest rate swap are recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The collateral for interest rate swap is cash, a Level 1 asset. The interest rate swap is a Level 2 liability as it uses observable inputs other than quoted market prices in an active market. There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, new Level 1 assets were added in connection with the Company's purchase of available-for-sale securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company held billion available-for-sale securities. Marketable securities maturing in one year or less are classified as current assets and marketable securities maturing in more than one year are classified as non-current assets. 
 The Company reviews the status of each security quarterly to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. In making its determination, the Company considers a number of factors, including: (1) the significance of the decline; (2) whether the security was rated below investment grade; (3) failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and (4) the Company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time for it to recover. The Company has determined that there were no other-than-temporary impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Deferred Consideration 
 The deferred consideration arose from the acquisition of Motus Biosciences, Inc. (Motus) in August 2021. The Company was obligated to issue to Motus equityholders an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, subject to certain reductions. During August 2022, August 2023, and August 2024, the Company fulfilled the payments due on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date by issuing shares, shares an d s hares of the Company's common stock, respectively, after certain reductions. A valuation of the deferred consideration was performed quarterly with gains and losses included within change in fair value of deferred and contingent consideration liabilities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. As the deferred consideration was settled in shares, no discount rate was applied in the fair value calculation. 
 The deferred consideration was classified as a Level 2 recurring liability as its valuation utilized an input, the Insmed share price, which is a directly observable input at the measurement date and for the duration of the liabilities' anticipated lives. Deferred consideration expected to be settled within twelve months or less is classified as a current liability within accounts payable and accrued liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, there is no remaining deferred consideration. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 The contingent consideration liabilities arose from the acquisitions of Motus and AlgaeneX, Inc. (AlgaeneX) (together, the Business Acquisition) in August 2021 (see Note 16 - Acquisitions ). The contingent consideration liabilities consist of developmental and regulatory milestones, a priority review voucher milestone and net sales milestones. Upon the achievement

 shares in the aggregate and AlgaeneX equityholders up to shares in the aggregate. The fair value of the development and regulatory milestones are estimated utilizing a probability-adjusted approach. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average probability of success was . The development and regulatory milestones will be settled in shares of the Company's common stock. As such, there is no discount rate applied in the fair value calculation. 
 If the Company were to receive a priority review voucher, the Company is obligated to pay to the Motus equityholders a portion of the value of the priority review voucher, subject to certain reductions. The potential payout will be either of the after tax net proceeds received by the Company from a sale of the priority review voucher or of the average of the sales prices for the last publicly disclosed priority review voucher sales, less certain adjustments. The fair value of the priority review voucher milestone is estimated utilizing a probability-adjusted discounted cash flow approach. This obligation will be settled in cash. 
 The contingent consideration liabilities for net sales milestones were valued using an option pricing model with Monte Carlo simulation. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of these net sales milestones were deemed immaterial to the overall fair value of the contingent consideration. 
 The contingent consideration liabilities have been classified as a Level 3 recurring liability as its valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market. If different assumptions were used for the inputs to the valuation approach, the estimated fair value could be significantly different than the fair value the Company determined. Contingent consideration expected to be settled within twelve months or less is classified as a current liability within accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Contingent consideration expected to be settled in more than twelve months is classified as a non-current liability. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the current and non-current contingent consideration was million and million, respectively. 
 A valuation of the contingent consideration liabilities is performed quarterly with gains and losses included within change in fair value of deferred and contingent consideration liabilities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

 Convertible Notes 
 The fair value of the Company's convertible notes, which differs from their carrying value, is influenced by interest rates, the Company's stock price and stock price volatility (collectively, the Current Market Factors), and is determined by prices for the convertible notes observed in market trading which are Level 2 inputs. 
 The estimated fair value of the Company's convertible senior notes due 2028 (the 2028 Convertible Notes) (categorized as a Level 2 liability for fair value measurement purposes) as of September 30, 2024 was billion, deter mined using Current Market Factors and the ability of the Company to obtain debt on comparable terms to the 2028 Convertible Notes. See Note 10 - Debt for further details. 
 Synthetic Royalty Financing Agreement 
 In October 2022, the Company entered into a revenue interest purchase agreement (the Royalty Financing Agreement) with OrbiMed Royalty Credit Opportunities IV, LP (OrbiMed). Under the Royalty Financing Agreement, OrbiMed paid the Company million in exchange for the right to receive, on a quarterly basis, royalties in an amount equal to of ARIKAYCE global net sales prior to September 1, 2025 and of ARIKAYCE global net sales on or after September 1, 2025, as well as of brensocatib global net sales, if approved (the Revenue Interest Payments). In the event that OrbiMed has not received aggregate Revenue Interest Payments of at least million on or prior to March 31, 2028, the Company must make a one-time payment to OrbiMed for the difference between the million and the aggregated Revenue Interest Payments that have been paid. In addition, the royalty rate for ARIKAYCE will be increased beginning March 31, 2028 to the rate which would have resulted in aggregate Revenue Interest Payments as of March 31, 2028 equaling million . The total Revenue Interest Payments payable by the Company to OrbiMed are capped at x of the purchase price or up to a maximum of x of the purchase price under certain conditions. 
 The fair value of the Royalty Financing Agreement at the time of the transaction was based on the Company s estimates of future royalties expected to be paid to OrbiMed over the life of the arrangement, which was determined using forecasts from market data sources, which are considered Level 3 inputs. This liability is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the arrangement, in accordance with ASC 470, Debt and ASC 835, Interest. The Company will utilize the prospective method to account for subsequent changes in the estimated future payments to be made to OrbiMed and will update the effective interest rate on a quarterly basis. See Note 11 - Royalty Financing Agreement for further details.

 Japan Europe and rest of world Total product revenues, net 
 Revenue is recorded at net selling price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established for (a) customer credits, such as invoice discounts for prompt pay, (b) estimated government rebates, such as Medicaid and Medicare Part D reimbursements, and estimated managed care rebates, (c) estimated chargebacks, and (d) estimated costs of co-payment assistance. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (prompt pay discounts and chargebacks), prepaid expenses (co-payment assistance), or as a current liability (rebates). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as the Company's historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company's best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the applicable contract. The amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company's estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. 
 Customer credits: Certain of the Company's customers are offered various forms of consideration, including prompt payment discounts. The payment terms for sales to specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors for prompt payment discounts are based on contractual rates agreed with the respective specialty pharmacies and distributors. The Company anticipates that its customers will earn these discounts and, therefore, deducts the full amount of these discounts from total gross product revenues at the time such revenues are recognized. 
 Rebates: The Company contracts with certain government agencies and managed care organizations, or collectively, third-party payors, so that ARIKAYCE will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. The Company estimates the rebates it will provide to third-party payors and deducts these estimated amounts from total gross product revenues at the time the revenues are recognized. These reserves are recorded in the same period in which the revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability. The current liability is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimates the rebates that it will provide to third-party payors based upon (i) the Company's contracts with these third-party payors, (ii) the government mandated discounts applicable to government-funded programs, (iii) a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payor mix, and (iv) information obtained from the Company's specialty pharmacies. 
 Chargebacks: Chargebacks are discounts that occur when certain contracted customers, currently public health service institutions and federal government entities purchasing via the Federal Supply Schedule, purchase directly from the Company's specialty distributor. Contracted customers generally purchase the product at a discounted price and the specialty distributor, in

 to . In its assessment of the term of each such lease, the Company has not included any options to extend or terminate the lease due to the absence of economic incentives in its lease agreements. Leases that qualify for treatment as a short-term lease are expensed as incurred. These short-term leases are not material to the Company's financial position. Furthermore, the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets. The Company's leases do not contain residual value guarantees and it does not sublease any of its leased assets. 
 The Company outsources its manufacturing operations to CMOs. Upon review of the agreements with its CMOs, the Company determined that these contracts contain embedded leases for dedicated manufacturing facilities. The Company obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the manufacturing facilities, the Company has the right to direct how and for what purpose the facility is used throughout the period of use, and the supplier does not have the right to change the operating instructions of the facility. The operating lease right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities associated with the manufacturing facilities is the sum of the minimum guarantees over the life of the production contracts. 
 The Company also records variable consideration for variable lease payments in excess of fixed fees or minimum guarantees. Variable consideration related to the Company's leasing arrangements was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Variable costs related to CMO manufacturing agreements are direct costs related to the manufacturing of ARIKAYCE and are capitalized within inventory in the Company's consolidated balance sheet, while the variable costs related to other leasing arrangements, not related to the manufacturing of ARIKAYCE, have been classified within operating expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

 business day period immediately after any consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes, as determined following a request by a holder of such notes, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on such trading day, (ii) the Company elects to distribute to all or substantially all holders of the common stock (a) any rights, options or warrants (other than in connection with a stockholder rights plan for so long as the rights issued under such plan have not detached from the associated shares of common stock) entitling them, for a period of not more than days from the declaration date for such distribution, to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is less than the average of the last reported sale prices of the common stock for the consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, or (b) the Company's assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company, which distribution has a per share value, as reasonably determined by the board of directors, exceeding of the last reported sale price of the common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, (iii) if a transaction or event that constitutes a fundamental change or a make-whole fundamental change occurs, or if the Company is a party to (a) a consolidation, merger, combination, statutory or binding share exchange or similar transaction, pursuant to which the common stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, cash, securities or other property or assets, or (b) any sale, conveyance, lease or other transfer or similar transaction in one transaction or a series of transactions of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all or any portion of the 2028 Convertible Notes may be surrendered by a holder for conversion at any time from or after the date that is scheduled trading days prior to the anticipated effective date of the transaction, (iv) if during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (each, a Stock Price Convertibility Trigger), or (v) if the Company sends a notice of redemption, a holder may surrender all or any portion of its 2028 Convertible Notes to which the notice of redemption relates for conversion at any time on or after the date the applicable notice of redemption was sent until the close of business on (a) the second business day immediately preceding the related redemption date or (b) if the Company fails to pay the redemption price on the redemption date as specified in such notice of redemption, such later date on which the redemption price is paid. 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes can be settled in cash, common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock at the Company's option, and thus, the Company determined the embedded conversion option in the 2028 Convertible Notes is not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative. However, since the 2028 Convertible Notes are within the scope of the accounting guidance for cash convertible instruments, the Company is required to separate the 2028 Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component of the 2028 Convertible Notes as of the date of issuance was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that did not have an associated equity component. The fair value was based on data from readily available pricing sources which utilize market observable inputs and other characteristics for similar types of instruments. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the embedded conversion option of the 2028 Convertible Notes was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the gross proceeds of the 2028 Convertible Notes. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized to interest expense over the expected life of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component using the effective interest method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification in the accounting guidance for contracts in an entity s own equity. The same accounting approach was taken for the 2025 Convertible Notes, which are no longer outstanding. 
 The fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes on the date of issuance was estimated at million using an effective interest rate of and, accordingly, the residual equity component on the date of issuance was million. The fair value of the liability component of the 2028 Convertible Notes on the date of issuance was estimated at million using an effective interest rate of and, accordingly, the residual equity component on the date of issuance was million. The respective discounts were amortized to interest expense over the term of the applicable series of convertible notes through December 31, 2022, prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06. The 2028 Convertible Notes have a remaining term of approximately years. 
 The million carrying value of the 2028 Convertible Notes as of September 30, 2024 is net of million of

The provisions recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are primarily a result of certain of the Company's international subsidiaries, which had taxable income during the periods.

 shares of the Company s common stock, following certain closing-related reductions, to Motus s former stockholders and option holders and certain individuals who are entitled to receive a portion of the acquisition consideration (collectively, Motus equityholders), subject to certain adjustments . The Company was obligated to issue to Motus equityholders an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date and is obligated to issue to the Motus equityholders up to shares in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events, and to pay to the Motus equityholders an aggregate of million upon the achievement of certain net sales-based milestones and a portion of the value of a priority review voucher (to the extent issued to the Company), in each case, subject to certain reductions. During August 2022, August 2023 and August 2024, the Company fulfilled the payments due on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date by issuing shares, shares and shares of the Company's common stock, respectively, after certain reductions. 
 At the closing of the Company s acquisition of AlgaeneX, the Company paid million in cash to AlgaeneX s former stockholders and certain individuals who are entitled to receive a portion of the acquisition consideration (collectively, the AlgaeneX equityholders). The Company is obligated to issue to the AlgaeneX equityholders an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock upon the achievement of a development milestone event and pay to the AlgaeneX equityholders a mid-single digits licensing fee on certain future payments received by the Company in licensing transactions for AlgaeneX s manufacturing technology, in each case, subject to certain reductions. 
 The shares of the Company s common stock issued to the Motus equityholders and the AlgaeneX equityholders were issued, and the shares issuable in the future will be issued, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the numbers of such issued and issuable shares was calculated based on a per share value of , which was the weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock preceding the closing of the Business Acquisition for the consecutive trading day period beginning on May 24, 2021. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the issuance of common stock to the Motus equityholders or the AlgaeneX equityholders. 
 The Company evaluated the Business Acquisition under ASC 805 and ASU 2017-01. The Company concluded that substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is not concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. The transaction does not pass the screen test and thus management performed a full assessment to determine if the acquired entities met the definition of a business. For the full assessment, management considered whether it has acquired (a) inputs, (b) substantive processes, and (c) outputs. Under ASC 805, to be considered a business, a set of activities and assets is required to have only the first two of the three elements, which together are or will be used in the future to create outputs. Management determined that the acquired entities met the definition of a business since the Company acquired inputs and substantive processes capable of producing outputs. 
 Therefore, the transaction has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, the total purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the consideration totaled approximately million. The results of Motus's and AlgaeneX's operations have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive loss beginning on the acquisition date. 
 The fair value of IPR D was capitalized as of the acquisition date and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or disposition of the assets or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon successful completion of the development efforts, the useful lives of the IPR D assets will be determined based on the anticipated period of regulatory exclusivity and will be amortized within operating expenses. Until that time, the IPR D assets will be subject to impairment testing and will not be amortized. The goodwill recorded related to the acquisition is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred by the acquirer over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The goodwill recorded is not deductible for tax purposes.

 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 202 3 . 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases. Our first commercial product, ARIKAYCE, is approved in the US as ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion and in Japan as ARIKAYCE inhalation 590 mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). ARIKAYCE received accelerated approval in the US in September 2018 for the treatment of MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options in a refractory setting. In October 2020, the EC approved ARIKAYCE for the treatment of NTM lung infections caused by MAC in adults with limited treatment options who do not have CF. In March 2021, Japan's MHLW approved ARIKAYCE for the treatment of patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who did not sufficiently respond to prior treatment with a multidrug regimen. NTM lung disease caused by MAC (which we refer to as MAC lung disease) is a rare and often chronic infection that can cause irreversible lun g damage and can be fatal. 
 Our pipeline includes clinical-stage programs brensocatib and TPIP, as well as early-stage research programs. Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of DPP1, which we are developing for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis and other neutrophil-mediated diseases, including CRSsNP and HS . TPIP is an inhaled formulation of the treprostinil prodrug treprostinil palmitil which may offer a differentiated product profile for PH-ILD and PAH. Our early-stage research programs encompass a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, AI-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue. 
 The information below summarizes our updates and anticipated near-term milestones for ARIKAYCE and our product candidates. 
 ARIKAYCE 
 We announced positive topline results from the ARISE trial in the third quarter of 2023. 
 In June 2024, we met and aligned with the FDA on the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study. If the data are positive, ENCORE may support a label expansion to include all MAC lung patients as well as support full approval for the current refractory indication. In September 2024, we closed screening of new patients in the ENCORE study which we expect will result in us exceeding our target enrollment of 400 patients in the study. 
 We anticipate reporting topline data from ENCORE in the first quarter of 2026. 
 Brensocatib 
 We announced positive topline results from the ASPEN trial in May 2024. The study met its primary endpoint, with both dosage strengths of brensocatib demonstrating statistically significant reductions in the annualized rate of adjudicated pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) versus placebo. 
 We remain on track to file an NDA with the FDA for brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis in the fourth quarter of 2024. We are advancing commercial readiness activities in preparation for a launch of brensocatib for patients with bronchiectasis, if approved. If a priority review is granted and brensocatib is approved, Insmed anticipates a US launch in mid-2025. Launches in Europe and Japan are expected in the first half of 2026, pending approvals. 
 We are conducting further studies to explore the potential of brensocatib in additional neutrophil-mediated diseases. The Phase 2b BiRCh trial of brensocatib in patients with CRSsNP is underway and we expect to initiate a Phase 2 study of brensocatib in patients with HS in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 TPIP 
 Enrollment in the Phase 2 study of TPIP in PAH remains ongoing. We anticipate topline results in the second half of 2025. 
 In May 2024, we reported topline safety data and certain exploratory efficacy endpoints from the Phase 2 study of TPIP in patients with PH-ILD. Based on these Phase 2 results in PH-ILD, we are advancing toward discussions with global regulatory authorities on the design of a Phase 3 study in PH-ILD, which we anticipate initiating in the second half of 2025. 
 Early-Stage Research 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 We continue to progress our early-stage research programs across a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, AI-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue. 
 To complement our internal research and development, we also actively evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities for products, product candidates and technologies, including those that address serious and rare diseases with significant unmet need. 
 Our Strategy 
 We strive to develop and commercialize first- and best-in-class therapies that serve patient communities where the need is greatest. Our first product, ARIKAYCE, is approved in the US as ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion and in Japa n as ARIKAYCE inhalation 590 mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). We are not aware of any other approved inhaled therapies specifically indicated to treat MAC lung disease in North America, Europe or Japan. We believe that ARIKAYCE has the potential to prove beneficial in other patients with refractory MAC. Our product candidates are brensocatib, our Phase 3 product candidate that we are developing for patients with bronchiectasis and other neutrophil-mediated diseases, and TPIP, our Phase 2 product candidate that may offer a differentiated product profile for patients with PH-ILD and PAH. We announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 ASPEN trial in brensocatib in May 2024 and plan to file an NDA with the FDA for brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis in the fourth quarter of 2024, followed by filings with the European and Japanese regulatory authorities. We are also advancing our early-stage research programs encompassing a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, AI-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue. 
 Our key priorities are as follows: 
 Continue to provide ARIKAYCE to appropriate patients and expand our reliable revenue stream; 
 Produce topline clinical data readouts in the near and long term; 
 Advance commercial readiness activities to serve significantly more patients facing serious diseases; and 
 Control spending, prudently deploying capital to support the best return-generating opportunities. 
 ARIKAYCE for Patients with MAC Lung Disease 
 ARIKAYCE is our first approved product. ARIKAYCE received accelerated approval in the US in September 2018 for the treatment of refractory MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. In October 2020, ARIKAYCE received approval in Europe for the treatment of NTM lung infections caused by MAC in adults with limited treatment options who do not have CF. In March 2021, ARIKAYCE received approval in Japan for the treatment of patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who did not sufficiently respond to prior treatment with a multidrug regimen. MAC lung disease is a rare and often chronic infection that can cause irreversible lung damage and can be fatal. Amikacin solution for parenteral administration is an established drug that has activity against a variety of NTM; however, its use is limited by the need to administer it intravenously and by toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Unlike amikacin solution for intravenous administration, our proprietary Pulmovance technology uses charge-neutral liposomes to deliver amikacin directly to the lungs where liposomal amikacin is taken up by the lung macrophages where the MAC infection resides. This technology also prolongs the release of amikacin in the lungs, while minimizing systemic exposure, thereby offering the potential for decreased systemic toxicities. ARIKAYCE's ability to deliver high levels of amikacin directly to the lung and sites of MAC infection via the use of our Pulmovance technology distinguishes it from intravenous amikacin. ARIKAYCE is administered once-daily using Lamira, an inhalation device developed and manufactured by PARI. Lamira is a portable nebulizer that enables aerosolization of liquid medications via a vibrating, perforated membrane, and was designed specifically for ARIKAYCE delivery. 
 The FDA has designated ARIKAYCE as an orphan drug and a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for NTM lung disease. Orphan designated drugs are eligible for seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication. QIDP designation provides an additional five years of exclusivity for the designated indication. The FDA granted a total of 12 years of exclusivity in the indication for which ARIKAYCE was approved. 
 ARIKAYCE also has been included in the international treatment guidelines for NTM lung disease. The evidence-based guidelines, issued by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society (ERS), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), strongly recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options who have failed to convert to a negative sputum culture after at least six months of treatment.

 In October 2020, the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application for ARIKAYCE, adding important efficacy data regarding the durability and sustainability of culture conversion to the ARIKAYCE label. The data, which are from the Phase 3 CONVERT study of ARIKAYCE, demonstrate that the addition of ARIKAYCE to guideline-based therapy (GBT) was associated with sustained culture conversion through the end of treatment as well as durable culture conversion three months post-treatment compared with GBT alone. 
 Accelerated Approval 
 In March 2018, we submitted an NDA for ARIKAYCE to the FDA to request accelerated approval. Accelerated approval allows drugs that (i) are being developed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and (ii) provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments to be approved substantially based on an intermediate endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, rather than a clinical endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. In September 2018, the FDA granted accelerated approval for ARIKAYCE under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD) for the treatment of refractory MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. LPAD, which was enacted as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, serves to advance the development of new antibacterial drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections in limited populations of patients with unmet needs. As required for drugs approved under the LPAD pathway, labeling for ARIKAYCE includes certain statements to convey that the drug has been shown to be safe and effective only for use in a limited population. 
 As a condition of accelerated approval, we must conduct a post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial. In December 2020, we commenced the post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial program for ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease consisting of the ARISE trial, an interventional study designed to validate cross-sectional and longitudinal characteristics of a PRO tool in MAC lung disease, and the ENCORE trial, designed to establish the clinical benefits and evaluate the safety of ARIKAYCE in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent MAC lung infection who have not started antibiotics using the PRO tool validated in the ARISE trial. In September 2023, we announced positive topline results from the ARISE trial. The study met its primary objective of demonstrating that the QOL-B respiratory domain works effectively as a PRO tool in patients with MAC lung disease. Based on these results, we have proposed to the FDA that the change of the respiratory score derived from the QOL-B respiratory domain PRO be the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study. In June 2024, we met and aligned with the FDA on the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study. If the data are positive, ENCORE may support a label expansion to include all MAC lung patients as well as support full approval for the current refractory indication. Based on feedback and in alignment with the FDA, we have determined that the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study will include 8 questions from the QOL-B respiratory domain PRO. In September 2024, we closed screening of new patients in the ENCORE study which we expect will result in us exceeding our target enrollment of 400 patients in the study. We anticipate reporting topline data in the first quarter of 2026. 
 Regulatory Pathway Outside of the US 
 In October 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization for ARIKAYCE for the treatment of NTM lung infections caused by MAC in adults with limited treatment options who do not have CF. ARIKAYCE can now be prescribed for patients across the European Union (EU) countries as well as in the UK. ARIKAYCE is reimbursed nationally in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland. We have worked with the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-SV) towards an agreement on the price of ARIKAYCE that would allow us to better serve the needs of patients in Germany; however, since we have been unable to reach an agreement, patient supply of ARIKAYCE in Germany was enabled by import from other EU countries in September 2022. We are working to ensure an uninterrupted supply of ARIKAYCE for patients in Germany and to provide physicians and pharmacists the information they need to obtain ARIKAYCE for their patients through the importation pathway. In January 2023, we agreed upon reimbursement terms with the French authorities. To date, we have been unable to reach an acceptable agreement of a nationally reimbursed price with the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA); however, ARIKAYCE remains commercially available for physicians to prescribe in Italy under Class C, where we set the price and funding is agreed locally. 
 In March 2021, Japan's MHLW approved ARIKAYCE for the treatment of patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who did not sufficiently respond to prior treatment with a multidrug regimen. In July 2021, we launched ARIKAYCE in Japan. 
 The CONVERT Study and 312 Study 
 Accelerated approval of ARIKAYCE was supported by preliminary data from the CONVERT study, a global Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ARIKAYCE in adult patients with refractory MAC lung disease, using achievement of sputum culture conversion (defined as three consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6 as the primary endpoint. Patients who achieved sputum culture conversion by Month 6 continued in the CONVERT study for an additional 12 months of treatment following the first monthly negative sputum culture in order to assess the durability of culture conversion, as defined by patients that have completed treatment and continued in the CONVERT study off all therapy for three months. In

 May 2019, we presented at the American Thoracic Society meeting that 41/65 (63.1 of patients on ARIKAYCE plus GBT who had achieved culture conversion by Month 6 had maintained durable culture conversion for three months off all therapy compared to 0/10 (0 on GBT only (p Table of Contents 

 comparator arm), cough (27.1 vs. 7.8 ), diarrhea (27.1 vs. 25.5 ), and COVID-19 (12.5 vs. 9.8 ). Of the treatment-emergent serious adverse events observed in the trial, none were determined to be related to ARIKAYCE by investigators. 
 Further Research and Lifecycle Management 
 We are currently exploring and supporting research and lifecycle management programs for ARIKAYCE beyond treatment of refractory MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial regimen for adult patients who have limited or no treatment options. As noted above, we will continue to advance the post-marketing confirmatory MAC lung disease clinical trial program for ARIKAYCE, through the ARISE and ENCORE trials, which are intended to fulfill the FDA's post-marketing requirement to allow for the full approval of ARIKAYCE in the US, as well as to support the use of ARIKAYCE as a treatment for patients with MAC lung disease. 
 The ENCORE trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3b study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an ARIKAYCE-based regimen in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent MAC infection who have not started antibiotics. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive ARIKAYCE plus background regimen or placebo plus background regimen once daily for 12 months. Patients will then discontinue all study treatments and remain in the trial for three months for the assessment of durability of culture conversion. The primary endpoint is change from baseline to Month 13 in respiratory symptom score. The key secondary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving durable culture conversion at Month 15. In June 2024, we met and aligned with the FDA on the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study. If the data are positive, ENCORE may support a label expansion to include all MAC lung patients as well as support full approval for the current refractory indication. Based on feedback and in alignment with the FDA, we have determined that the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study will include 8 questions from the QOL-B respiratory domain PRO. In September 2024, we closed screening of new patients in the ENCORE study which we expect will result in us exceeding our target enrollment of 400 patients in the study. We anticipate reporting topline data in the first quarter of 2026. 
 Subsequent lifecycle management studies could also potentially enable us to reach more patients. These initiatives may include new clinical studies sponsored by us and may also include investigator-initiated studies, which are independent clinical studies initiated and sponsored by physicians or research institutions, with funding from us. 
 Product Pipeline 
 Brensocatib 
 Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of DPP1, which we licensed from AstraZeneca in October 2016. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. Neutrophils contain the NSPs (including neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G) that have been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. 
 In March 2020, AstraZeneca exercised its first option pursuant to our October 2016 license agreement under which AstraZeneca can advance clinical development of brensocatib in the indications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Under the terms of the agreement, upon exercise of this option, AstraZeneca is solely responsible for all aspects of the development of brensocatib up to and including Phase 2b clinical trials in COPD or asthma. In March 2024, AstraZeneca exercised its second and final option under the agreement, to further develop brensocatib beyond Phase 2b clinical trials and, if approved, commercialize brensocatib in the indications of COPD or asthma, upon reaching agreement after good faith negotiations resulting in terms, including financial terms, satisfactory to us and to AstraZeneca for such further development and commercialization. In June 2024, the negotiation period following such exercise of the final option expired. No agreement was reached between us and AstraZeneca to permit AstraZeneca to further develop and, if approved, commercialize brensocatib in the indications of COPD or asthma. We retain full worldwide development and commercialization rights for brensocatib in all indications other than COPD or asthma and AstraZeneca has no further development or commercialization rights for brensocatib in COPD, asthma or any other indication. 
 In June 2020, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for brensocatib for the treatment of adu lt patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) for reducing exacerbations. The FDA's breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of therapies that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include more frequent communication and meetings with the FDA, eligibility for rolling and priority review, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and organizational commitment from the FDA involving senior managers. In November 2020, brensocatib was granted access to the PRIME scheme from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for patients with NCFBE. 
 In October 2021, the EMA s Paediatric Committee approved the brensocatib Pediatric Investigational Plan for the treatment of patients with NCFBE. As a result, the ASPEN trial includes 41 adolescent patients between ages 12 to 17, which will fulfill the pediatric study requirements to support marketing applications in this patient population in the US, Europe and

 The WILLOW Study 
 The WILLOW study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, multi-national, Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of brensocatib administered once daily for 24 weeks in patients with NCFBE. The WILLOW study was conducted at 116 sites and enrolled 256 adult patients diagnosed with NCFBE who had at least two documented pulmonary exacerbations in the 12 months prior to screening. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 10 mg or 25 mg of brensocatib or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to first pulmonary exacerbation over the 24-week treatment period in the brensocatib arms compared to the placebo arm. 
 WILLOW Efficacy Data 
 We announced topline data for the WILLOW study in February 2020 and full data for the WILLOW study in June 2020. In September 2020, final results from the WILLOW study were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. The data demonstrate that the WILLOW study met its primary endpoint of time to first pulmonary exacerbation over the 24-week treatment period for both the 10 mg and 25 mg dosage groups of brensocatib compared to placebo (p=0.027, p=0.044, respectively). The risk of exacerbation at any time during the trial was reduced by 42 for the 10 mg group versus placebo (HR 0.58, p=0.029) and by 38 for the 25 mg group versus placebo (HR 0.62, p=0.046). In addition, treatment with brensocatib 10 mg resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations, a key secondary endpoint, versus placebo. Specifically, patients treated with brensocatib experienced a 36 reduction in the 10 mg arm (p=0.041) and a 25 reduction in the 25 mg arm (p=0.167) versus placebo. Change in concentration of active neutrophil elastase in sputum versus placebo from baseline to the end of the treatment period was also statistically significant (p=0.034 for 10 mg, p=0.021 for 25 mg). 
 WILLOW Safety and Tolerability Data 
 Brensocatib was generally well-tolerated in the study. Rates of AEs leading to discontinuation in patients treated with placebo, brensocatib 10 mg, and brensocatib 25 mg were 10.6 , 7.4 , and 6.7 , respectively. The most common AEs in patients treated with brensocatib were cough, headache, sputum increase, dyspnea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection. Rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in patients treated with placebo, brensocatib 10 mg, and brensocatib 25 mg, respectively, were as follows: rates of skin events (including hyperkeratosis) were 11.8 , 14.8 , and 23.6 ; rates of dental events were 3.5 , 16.0 , and 10.1 ; and rates of infections that were considered AESIs were 17.6 , 13.6 , and 16.9 . 
 The ASPEN Study 
 Base d on the positive results of the WILLOW study, in December 2020 we commenced the ASPEN study, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brensocatib in adult patients with b ronchiectasis. Patients with bronchiectasis due to CF were not enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint was the rate of adjudicated PEs over the 52-week treatment period. Secondary endpoints included the time to first adjudicated PE, the proportion of subjects free of adjudicated PE by 52 weeks, the absolute change from baseline in post-bronchodilator FEV1, the reduction in annualized rate of severe adjudicated PE, and the change from baseline in the Bronchiectasis QOL-B Respiratory Symptoms Domain Score. 
 As part of the ASPEN study s conduct, more than 460 trial sites were engaged in nearly 40 countries. After excluding sites that did not enroll any patients and all sites in Ukraine, due to the ongoing conflict, the total number of active sites in ASPEN was 391 sites in 35 countries. Adult patients (ages 18 to 85 years) were randomized 1:1:1 and adolescent patients (ages 12 to

 Further Research and Development 
 In August 2019, we received notice from the FDA that we were awarded a development grant of 1.8 million for specific work to be performed on a PRO tool. The grant funding is for the development of a novel PRO tool for use in clinical trials to measure symptoms in patients with NCFBE with and without NTM lung infection. 
 In January 2023, we reported topline data from the Phase 2, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of brensocatib in patients with CF. This Phase 2 study included both patients who were on background CFTR modulator drugs and patients who were not on CFTR modulator drugs. The study duration was approximately one month and dosed CF patients to placebo, 10 mg, 25 mg, and 40 mg of brensocatib. A clear dose-dependent and exposure-dependent inhibition of blood NSPs was observed in patients treated with brensocatib across all doses in this study, consistent with the mechanism of action of brensocatib. Safety and tolerability were consistent with what was observed during the Phase 2 WILLOW study, with no significant drug-related findings. We concluded that an additional cohort evaluating a 65 mg dose of brensocatib is not needed in this patient population. 
 We are conducting further studies to explore the potential of brensocatib in additional neutrophil-mediated diseases, including CRSsNP and HS. CRSsNP currently has one approved pharmacological therapy (corticosteriod nasal spray); however, many patients do not respond to corticosteroids or endoscopic sinus surgery. The Phase 2b BiRCh trial of brensocatib in patients with CRSsNP is underway and we expect to initiate a Phase 2 study of brensocatib in patients with HS in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Treprostinil Palmitil Inhalation Powder 
 TPIP is an investigational inhaled formulation of a treprostinil prodrug that has the potential to address certain of the current limitations of existing prostanoid therapies. We believe that TPIP prolongs duration of effect and may provide patients with greater consistency in pulmonary arterial pressure reduction over time. Current inhaled prostanoid therapies must be dosed four to nine times per day. Reducing dose frequency has the potential to ease treatment burden for patients and improve compliance. Additionally, we believe that TPIP may be associated with fewer side effects, including severity and/or frequency of cough, headache, throat irritation, nausea, flushing and dizziness that are associated with high initial drug levels and local upper airway exposure when using current inhaled prostanoid therapies. We believe TPIP may offer a differentiated product profile for PH-ILD and PAH. 
 In February 2021, we announced topline results from the Phase 1 study of TPIP in healthy volunteers. The objective of this first-in-human single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerability profile of TPIP. Data from the study demonstrated that TPIP was generally well tolerated, with a pharmacokinetic profile that supports continued development with once-daily dosing. The most common AEs across all cohorts in the study were cough, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Most AEs were mild in severity and consistent in nature with those typically seen with other inhaled prostanoid therapies. There were few moderate AEs and no severe or serious AEs. Subjects in the multiple dose panel that incorporated an up-titration approach beginning at 112.5 g once-daily and progressing to 225 g once-daily reported fewer AEs compared to the panel dosed with 225 g once-daily from the first dose.

 Overall pharmacokinetic results demonstrated that treprostinil exposure (AUC and Cmax) was dose-proportional, with low to moderate inter-subject variability. Treprostinil was detected in the plasma at 24 hours at all doses and throughout the 48-hour sampling period for the two highest doses. Compared with currently available inhaled treprostinil therapy, TPIP showed substantially lower Cmax and longer half-life. Data from this study were presented in an oral session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in August 2021. 
 In May 2024, we reported topline safety data and certain exploratory efficacy endpoints from the Phase 2 study of TPIP in patients with PH-ILD. Based on these Phase 2 results in PH-ILD, we are advancing toward discussions with global regulatory authorities on the design of a Phase 3 study in PH-ILD, which we anticipate initiating in the second half of 2025. We also have an ongoing Phase 2 study designed to investigate the effect of TPIP in patients with PAH. Enrollment in the Phase 2 study of TPIP in PAH remains ongoing and we anticipate topline results in the second half of 2025. 
 Early-Stage Research 
 Our early-stage research efforts are comprised of our preclinical programs, advanced through internal research and development and augmented through business development activities. In March 2021, we acquired a proprietary protein deimmunization platform, called Deimmunized by Design, focused on the reengineering of therapeutic proteins to evade immune recognition and reaction. In August 2021, we acquired Motus and AlgaeneX, preclinical stage companies engaged in the research, development and manufacturing of gene therapies for rare genetic disorders. In January 2023, we acquired Vertuis, a privately held, preclinical stage company engaged in the research and development of gene therapies for rare genetic disorders. In June 2023, we acquired Adrestia, a privately held, preclinical stage company using precision genetic models to search for therapeutic targets, precision diagnostics, novel drug compounds and new applications for existing drugs. 
 We continue to progress our early-stage research programs across a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, AI-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue. 
 Corporate Development 
 We plan to continue to develop, acquire, in-license or co-promote other products, product candidates and technologies, including those that address serious and rare diseases that currently have significant unmet needs. We are focused broadly on serious and rare disease therapeutics and prioritizing those areas that best align with our core competencies. 
 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Product Revenues, Net 
 Product revenues, net, consist of net sales of ARIKAYCE. In October 2018, we began shipping ARIKAYCE to our customers in the US, which include specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. In December 2020, we began commercial sales of ARIKAYCE in Europe. In July 2021, we began recognizing product revenue from commercial sales of ARIKAYCE in Japan. We recognize revenue for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits, including prompt pay discounts, service fees, estimated rebates, including government rebates, such as Medicaid rebates and Medicare Part D coverage gap reimbursements in the US, and chargebacks. 
 Cost of Product Revenues (Excluding Amortization of Intangible Assets) 
 Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) consist primarily of direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing of ARIKAYCE sold, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight, and allocation of overhead costs, in addition to royalty expenses. We began capitalizing ARIKAYCE related inventory upon FDA approval of ARIKAYCE in September 2018. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 R D expenses consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel serving in our research and development functions, including medical affairs and program management. R D expenses also includes other internal operating expenses, the cost of manufacturing product candidates, including the medical devices for drug delivery, for clinical study, the cost of conducting clinical studies, and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities. In addition, R D expenses include payments to third parties for the license rights to products in development (prior to marketing approval), such as brensocatib, and may include the cost of asset acquisitions. Our R D expenses related to manufacturing our product candidates and medical devices for clinical study are primarily related to activities at CMOs that manufacture brensocatib, TPIP and early-stage research activities. Our R D expenses related to clinical trials are primarily related to activities at contract research organizations (CROs) that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. These contracts with CROs set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled. Payments under these contracts with CROs primarily depend on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones as well as time-based fees. Expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol. Deposits for goods or services that will be 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. Such amounts are then recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. 
 Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) Expenses 
 SG A expenses consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our non-employee directors and personnel serving in our executive, finance and accounting, legal and compliance, commercial and pre-commercial, corporate development, field sales, information technology and human resource functions. SG A expenses also include professional fees for legal services, consulting services, including commercial activities, insurance, board of director fees, tax and accounting services and certain milestones related to ARIKAYCE. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Upon commercialization of ARIKAYCE, our intangible assets began to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. The fair values assigned to our intangible assets are based on estimates and assumptions we believe are reasonable based on available facts and circumstances. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur that require us to review the assets for impairment. 
 Change in Fair Value of Deferred and Contingent Consideration Liabilities 
 In connection with the Business Acquisition, we recorded deferred and contingent consideration liabilities related to potential future milestone payments. Adjustments to the fair value are due to changes in: our stock price; the probability of achieving milestones; or certain other estimated assumptions. The change in fair value of deferred and contingent consideration liabilities is calculated quarterly with gains and losses recorded in the consolidated sta tements of comprehensive loss. 
 Investment Income and Interest Expense 
 Investment income consists of interest and dividend income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense consists primarily of contractual interest costs, Royalty Financing Agreement non-cash interest expense and the amortization of debt issuance costs related to our debt. Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the debt. Our balance sheet reflects debt, net of the debt issuance costs paid to the lender, and other third-party costs. Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with extinguished debt are expensed in the period of the extinguishment. 
 Change in Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap 
 We record derivative and hedge transactions in accordance with GAAP. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an interest rate swap contract (the Swap Contract) with a notional value of 350 million to economically hedge our variable rate-based term debt for three years, effectively changing the variable rate under the term debt to a fixed interest rate. Our interest rate swap has not been designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes. Consequently, all changes in the fair value of the Swap Contract are reported as a component of net loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

The change in fair value of deferred and contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in our share price. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income increased to 36.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 32.3 million in the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2024 relative to 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased to 63.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 60.9 million in the same period in 2023 primarily due to interest related to the Term Loan. See Note 10 - Debt and Note 11 - Royalty Financing Agreement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. 
 Change in Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap 
 The change in fair value of interest rate swap for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 million. Adjustments to the fair value are due to changes in interest rates as of September 30, 2024 relative to the fair value of interest rate swap as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Overview 
 There is considerable time and cost associated with developing potential pharmaceutical products to the point of regulatory approval and commercialization. We commenced commercial shipments of ARIKAYCE in October 2018. We expect to continue to incur consolidated operating losses, including losses at our US and certain international entities, as we plan to fund R D for ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP and our other pipeline programs, continue commercialization and regulatory activities for ARIKAYCE, fund pre-commercialization activities for brensocatib, and engage in other general and administrative activities. 
 In May 2024, we completed an underwritten offering of 14,514,562 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 51.50 per share. 1,893,203 of the shares of common stock were issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Our net proceeds from the sale of the shares, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses of 34.3 million, were 713.2 million. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a new sales agreement with Leerink to sell shares of the Company's common stock, with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to 500.0 million, from time to time, through the new ATM program, under which Leerink acts as sales agent. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we issued and sold an aggregate of 5,022,295 shares of common stock through the new ATM program at a weighted-average public offering price of 75.64 per share and received net proceeds of 371.3 million . As of September 30, 2024 , an aggregate of 120.1 million of shares of common stock remain available to be issued and sold under the new ATM program. 
 In October 2022, we entered into the 350 million Term Loan with Pharmakon that matures on October 19, 2027. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate based upon the SOFR, subject to a SOFR floor of 2.5 in addition to a margin of 7.75 per annum. Up to 50 of the interest payable during the first 24 months from the closing of the Term Loan may be paid-in-kind at our election. If elected, paid-in-kind interest will be capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Term Loan. The Term Loan, including the paid-in-kind interest, will be repaid in eight equal quarterly payments starting in the 13th quarter following the closing of the Term Loan (i.e., the quarter ending March 31, 2026), except that the repayment start date may be extended at our option for an additional four quarters, so that repayments start in the 17th quarter following the closing of the Term Loan, subject to the achievement of specified ARIKAYCE data thresholds and certain other conditions. Net proceeds from the Term Loan, after deducting the lenders' fees and deal expenses of 15.2 million, were 334.8 million. 
 In October 2022, we entered into the Royalty Financing Agreement with OrbiMed, whereby OrbiMed paid us 150 million in exchange for the right to receive, on a quarterly basis, royalties in an amount equal to 4 of ARIKAYCE global net sales prior to September 1, 2025 and 4.5 of ARIKAYCE global net sales on or after September 1, 2025, as well as 0.75 of brensocatib global net sales, if approved. In the event that OrbiMed has not received aggregate Revenue Interest 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 Payments equal to or greater than 150 million on or prior to March 31, 2028, the royalty rate for ARIKAYCE will be increased for all subsequent fiscal quarters to a rate which, if applied retroactively, would have resulted in aggregate Revenue Interest Payments to OrbiMed for all fiscal quarters ended on or prior to March 31, 2028 equal to 150 million. In addition, we must make a one-time payment to OrbiMed in an amount that, when added to the aggregate amount of Revenue Interest Payments received by OrbiMed as of March 31, 2028, would equal 150 million. The total Revenue Interest Payments payable by us to OrbiMed are capped at 1.8x of the purchase price or up to a maximum of 1.9x of the purchase price under certain conditions. Net proceeds from the Royalty Financing Agreement, after deducting the lenders' fees and deal expenses of 3.8 million, were 146.2 million . 
 In October 2022, we also completed an underwritten offering of 13,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 20.00 per share. Our net proceeds from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expense of 16.2 million, were 258.8 million. 
 We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, the continued commercialization of ARIKAYCE, launch readiness activities for the potential launch of brensocatib for th e treatment of p atients with bronchiectasis, if approved, clinical trials for brensocatib, TPIP, and our future product candidates, and to develop, acquire, in-license or co-promote other products or product candidates, including those that address orphan or rare diseases. While we believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for at least the next 12 months, we may opportunistically raise additional capital and may do so through equity or debt financing(s), strategic transactions or otherwise. Our cash requirements for the next 12 months will be impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which we expect to be the ASPEN trial, expenses related to our commercialization efforts and our ARISE and ENCORE clinical trials for ARIKAYCE, and other development activities for brensocatib, and to a lesser extent, expenses related to the clinical development of TPIP and our early-research programs. 
 Cash Flows 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 461.5 million, as compared with 482.4 million as of December 31, 2023. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 we had marketable securities of 1.0 billion, as compared with 298.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The 20.9 million increase in cash and cash equivalents and 708.4 million increase in marketable securities was primarily due to our underwritten offering of common stock in May 2024, and proceeds from our ATM program, partially offset by our cash used in operating activities. Our working capital was 1,390.7 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared with 703.4 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 487.9 million and 405.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily for the commercial, clinical and manufacturing activities related to ARIKAYCE, as well as other SG A expenses and clinical trial expenses related to brensocatib and TPIP. The increase in cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 was primarily due to the increase in net loss, excluding the adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 714.9 million and 225.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the purchase of marketable securities, partially offset by the maturities of marketable securities compared to the corresponding period in 2023 . 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 1,181.7 million and 45.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 is due to net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in our underwritten offering in May 2024, proceeds from our new ATM program, and proceeds from exercise of stock options and our ESPP in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There were no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 202 3. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not have any interest in special purpose entities, structured finance entities or other variable interest entities. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 202 3 . For the required interim disclosure updates related to our 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 accounting policies and estimates, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were in cash accounts and money market funds. Our investments in money market f unds are not insured by the federal government. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.0 billion in marketable securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 575.0 million of 2028 Convertible Notes outstanding. Our 2028 Convertible Notes bear interest at a coupon rate of 0.75 . In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had a 350 million Term Loan and a 150.0 million Royalty Financing Agreement outstanding. The Term Loan accrues interest quarterly at the SOFR subject to a floor of 2.5 , plus a margin of 7.75 per annum. We entered into the Swap Contract as a hedge to the Term Loan variable interest rate. The Royalty Financing Agreement requires a Revenue Interest Payment of 4 of ARIKAYCE global net sales prior to September 1, 2025 and 4.5 thereafter as well as 0.75 of brensocatib global net sales, if approved. If a 10 change in interest rates had occurred on September 30, 2024, it would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our debt as of that date, nor would it have a material effect on our future earnings or cash flows. 
 The majority of our business is conducted in US dollars. However, we do conduct certain transactions in other currencies, including Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Historically, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not materially affected our results of operations and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our results of operations were not materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcomes of these matters are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Our business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risk factors and other information contained in our other public filings in evaluating our business, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 202 3 , which was filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. Any of the risks and uncertainties described herein and in our other filings with the SEC, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects for growth, and the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition, these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q (please read " Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements " in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).

Table of Contents 

 We rely on third parties including collaborators, CROs, clinical and analytical laboratories, CMOs and other providers for many services that are critical to our business. If we are unable to form and sustain these relationships, or if any third-party arrangements that we may enter into are unsuccessful, including due to non-compliance by such third parties with our agreements or applicable law, our ability to develop and commercialize our products may be materially adversely affected. 
 We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for significant research, analytical services, preclinical development, clinical development and manufacturing of our product candidates and commercial scale manufacturing of ARIKAYCE and Lamira. For example, we do not own facilities for clinical-scale or commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, and we expect that our future supply requirements for brensocatib and TPIP will be manufactured by CMOs. We currently rely on Resilience Biotechnologies Inc. to provide our clinical and commercial supply of ARIKAYCE, and intend to also rely on Patheon in the future. We currently primarily rely on Esteve Pharmaceuticals, S.A. and Thermo Fisher to provide our clinical supply for brensocatib. Additionally, almost all of our clinical trial work is done by CROs, such as PPD Development, L.P., our CRO for the ARISE, ENCORE, ASPEN, BiRCh, and TPIP trials, and clinical laboratories. In addition, we rely on third parties to manufacture clinical materials for our early-stage research programs. Reliance on these third parties poses a number of risks, including the following: 
 
 The diversion of management time and cost of third-party advisers associated with the negotiation, documentation and implementation of agreements with third parties in the pharmaceutical industry; 
 The inability to control whether third parties devote sufficient resources to our programs or products, including with respect to meeting contractual deadlines; 
 The inability to control the regulatory and contractual compliance of third parties, including their quality systems, processes and procedures, systems utilized to collect and analyze data, and equipment used to test drug product and/or clinical supplies; 
 The inability to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements on favorable terms; 
 Disputes with third parties, including CROs, leading to loss of intellectual property rights, delay or termination of research, development, or commercialization of product candidates or litigation or arbitration; 
 Contracts with our collaborators fail to provide sufficient protection of our intellectual property; and 
 Difficulty enforcing our contractual rights if one of these third parties fails to perform. 
 We also rely on third parties to select and enter into agreements with clinical investigators to conduct clinical trials to support approval of our product candidates, and the failure of these third parties to appropriately carry out such evaluation and selection can adversely affect the quality of the data from these studies and, potentially, the approval of our products. In particular, as part of future drug approval submissions to the FDA, we must disclose certain financial interests of investigators who participated in any of the clinical studies being submitted in support of approval, or must certify to the absence of such financial interests. The FDA evaluates the information contained in such disclosures to determine whether disclosed interests may have an impact on the reliability of a study. If the FDA determines that financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious questions of data integrity, the FDA can institute a data audit, request that we submit further data analyses, conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results of the questioned study, or refuse to use the data from the questioned study as a basis for approval. A finding by the FDA that a financial relationship of an investigator raises serious questions of data integrity could delay or otherwise adversely affect approval of our products. 
 In January 2024, the US House of Representatives introduced the BIOSECURE Act (H.R. 7085) and the Senate advanced a substantially similar bill (S.3558), which legislation, if passed and enacted into law, would potentially restrict our ability to purchase services or products from, or otherwise collaborate with, any "biotechnology company of concern, which includes certain Chinese biotechnology companies, without losing the ability to contract with, or otherwise receive funding from, the US government. We do business with companies in China and it is possible some of our contractual counterparties could be impacted by this legislation. 
 These risks could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 On August 4, 2021, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of Motus, a privately held, preclinical stage company. Among other consideration, in connection with the acquisition of Motus, the Company was obligated to issue to Motus equityholders an aggregate of 184,433 shares of the Company s common stock on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date and is obligated to issue to the Motus equityholders up to 5,348,572 shares in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events, in each case, subject to certain reductions. On August 2, 2024, the third anniversary of the closing date, the Company fulfilled the payment due on such date by issuing 182,182 shares of the Company s common stock to the Motus equityholders. These shares of common stock were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and the number of such shares was

 calculated based on a per-share value of 27.11. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of common stock to the Motus equityholders. 
 On January 6, 2023, the Company acquired Vertuis, a privately held, preclinical stage company. Among other consideration, in connection with the acquisition of Vertuis, the Company was obligated to issue to Vertuis equityholders, on July 1, 2024, shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate value of 1.0 million, based on the share price on June 28, 2024. On July 1, 2024, the Company fulfilled the payment due by issuing 14,773 shares of common stock to the Vertuis equityholders. These shares of common stock were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of common stock to the Vertuis equityholders. 
 On June 27, 2024, the Company issued a redemption notice for its 2025 Convertible Notes, with a Redemption Date of August 9, 2024. The Company elected to settle any conversions of the 2025 Convertible Notes that occurred on or before the business day prior to the Redemption Date in shares of the Company s common stock. Holders of 224.8 million aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 2025 Convertible Notes elected to convert their notes into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 25.5384 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 39.16 per share of common stock). These conversions resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of 5,741,063 shares of the Company s common stock during the third quarter of 2024. The shares of the Company s common stock issued to the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes in connection with such conversions were issued pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of common stock to the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 From July 2024 through September 2024, holders of ten thousand dollars of aggregate principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes elected to convert their notes, resulting in an issuance of an aggregate of 306 shares of the Company s common stock. The shares of the Company s common stock issued to the holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of common stock to the holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes.
