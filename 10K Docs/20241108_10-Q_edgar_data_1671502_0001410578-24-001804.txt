Our first lead product is QRX003, a once daily, topical lotion comprised of a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor, formulated with the proprietary in-licensed Invisicare technology, is under development as a potential treatment for Netherton Syndrome NS ), a rare hereditary genetic disease. QRX003 is currently being tested in two clinical studies in the United States U.S. under an open Investigational New Drug IND application with the Food and Drug Administration FDA ). We are also developing QRX004 as a potential treatment for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa RDEB ). In addition, we entered into Research Agreements with the Queensland University of Technology QUT ), under which we have obtained an option for global licenses to QRX007 for the potential treatment of NS and QRX008 for the potential treatment of scleroderma, and with the University College Cork UCC for the development of novel topical formulations of Rapamycin (sirolimus) as potential treatments for a number of rare and orphan diseases for which there are currently no approved therapies or cures. Our objective is to develop and commercialize proprietary therapeutic drug products. To this effect, we intend to develop and seek marketing approvals from the FDA and other worldwide regulatory bodies for rare and orphan diseases. To achieve these objectives, we plan to: complete the late-stage clinical testing of QRX003 and, if successful, file for marketing approval in the United States and other territories; prepare to commercialize QRX003 by establishing our own sales infrastructure in the U.S. and Europe and entering into distribution partnerships in other territories such as those currently established for Canada, Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey and Singapore; and pursue business development activities by seeking partnering, licensing, merger and acquisition opportunities or other transactions to further expand our pipeline and drug-development capabilities. 
 We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and is subject to significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional capital prior to the commercialization of QRX003 or any other product candidate. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to continue our operations.

 ADS Ratio Change and Ordinary Share Reverse Split Effective July 18, 2023, the ratio of ADSs evidencing ordinary shares changed from 1 ADS representing five thousand (5,000) ordinary shares to 1 ADS representing sixty thousand (60,000) ordinary shares, which resulted in a 1 for 12 reverse split of the issued and outstanding ADSs. Effective November 8, 2023, we completed a 1 for 60,000 reverse split of the ordinary shares which resulted in the ratio of ADSs evidencing ordinary shares to be changed from 1 ADS representing sixty thousand (60,000) ordinary shares to 1 ADS representing one (1) ordinary share. Except as specifically provided, ordinary share, ADS and related option and warrant information presented herein, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes, has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the number of ordinary shares and ADSs resulting from the aforementioned ordinary share reverse split and ADS ratio changes. Recent Developments Clinical Development Quoin s lead asset, QRX003, is currently in late-stage clinical development in the U.S. under an open IND application with the FDA. Five clinical sites in the U.S. have been opened for our initial study, patients are actively being screened and recruited into the study and dosing commenced in December 2022. This study originally was designed as a randomized, double blinded assessment of two different doses of QRX003 versus a placebo vehicle in 18 adult NS patients. The test materials are applied once daily, over a twelve-week period, to pre-selected areas of the patient s body. Based on discussions with the FDA, a number of different clinical endpoints are being assessed in the study, including but not limited to, an Investigators Global Assessment (IGA), Patient s Global Assessment (PaGA) and Pruritis. In November 2022, we submitted a protocol for our second clinical study in NS patients to the FDA under our currently open IND (the Open Label Study ). This study was cleared by the FDA to initiate in December 2022. This study originally was designed to be conducted in ten adult NS patients who are currently receiving, and will continue to do so throughout the study, off-label systemic therapy, primarily systemic biologic therapy. This is an open-label study with no placebo control. Both of our NS clinical studies are running concurrently and utilize the same clinical trial sites and investigators. On October 24, 2023, we released positive initial clinical results obtained from the first six evaluable subjects in our open-label study. As a result of this positive initial data and the absence of any safety concerns from both studies, on November 8, 2023 we submitted a number of protocol amendments to the FDA, under our open IND, with a view to optimizing both studies and potentially leading to even better clinical outcomes and a more rapid regulatory approval. These protocol amendments included eliminating the lower dose from the double-blinded study, modifying the dosing frequency from once-daily to twice-daily and increasing the number of subjects from 18 to 30. For the open-label study, the number of subjects was increased from 10 to 20 and dosing was modified from once-daily to twice-daily. On December 13, 2023, we announced that we were cleared by the FDA to implement these protocol amendments. In February 2024 we submitted a further protocol amendment to the FDA requesting permission to lower the age of eligibility for participation in both studies to 14 years and older from 18 years and older. On March 4, 2024 we announced that we were cleared to implement this protocol amendment. All protocol amendments have now been implemented and going forward participants in both studies will be dosed twice-daily with those enrolled in the blinded study receiving either a 4 dose of QRX003 or a placebo, while subjects in the open-label will receive a 4 dose of QRX003 only. On June 27, 2024 we announced that we will expand our ongoing Netherton Syndrome clinical studies to include international sites. The first international site will be opened at a research hospital in Saudi Arabia. This hospital is currently treating a number of Netherton patients who will now become eligible for recruitment into our studies. An experienced Clinical Research Organization has been engaged to manage the study locally. On August 6, 2024, we announced the planned initiation of an investigator-led clinical study in New Zealand for QRX003 in pediatric patients with Peeling Skin Syndrome. This rare genetic condition currently has no approved treatments or cures. The first clinical site and patient have been identified, and Quoin is actively evaluating additional clinical sites in other countries.

 On October 22, 2024 we announced the further expansion of our ongoing Netherton Syndrome clinical studies to include to include two additional international sites in the United Kingdom (UK). These sites, Great Ormond Street Hospital and St. Thomas Hospital, both in London, are recognized centers of excellence for treating Netherton Syndrome patients in the UK. Both sites have available cohorts of patients potentially eligible to participate in Quoin s studies. A Principal Investigator for the UK studies has been appointed and a Clinical Research Organization has been engaged. The UK and Saudi Arabia sites will operate under the auspices of Quoin s open Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US Food and Drug Administration. Quoin is also in advanced stage of preparation for the opening of additional sites in several other Western European countries and is concluding a feasibility study in multiple Eastern European countries with both territories having available cohorts of patients with Netherton Syndrome. Research Agreement with University College Cork On June 10, 2024 we signed a research agreement with The School of Pharmacy at UCC. The scope of the agreement encompasses the development of novel topical formulations of rapamycin (sirolimus) as potential treatments for a number of rare and orphan diseases for which there are currently no approved therapies or cures. UCC will apply its proprietary dissolvable microneedle delivery technology along with other formulation approaches to optimize the local delivery of rapamycin and potentially enhance its therapeutic effectiveness as a potential treatment for several pre-identified clinical targets. Under the terms of the agreement, we will fund a research program at UCC over an anticipated 2-1/2 year period to investigate the development of a number of topical rapamycin formulations for future development as potential treatments for several rare and orphan diseases, where it is believed that the drug s mechanism of action may provide for clinical efficacy in these settings. Following completion of the research program, we will have the option to advance the clinical development of rapamycin formulations developed by UCC. The terms of the agreement do not require us to pay any upfront license or milestone fees or any royalties based on future product sales. Public Offering On March 7, 2024, (the 2024 Closing Date we completed an offering (the 2024 Offering of the following securities (i) 811,250 ordinary shares represented by ADSs, (ii) 4,062,500 Series D warrants (the Series D Warrants to purchase 4,062,500 ordinary shares represented by ADSs, (iii) 4,062,500 Series E warrants (the Series E Warrants and together with the Series D Warrants, the 2024 Warrants to purchase 4,062,500 ordinary shares represented by ADSs, and (iv) 3,251,250 pre-funded warrants (the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 3,251,250 ordinary shares represented by ADSs for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 6.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 5.5 million, after deducting the placement agent s fees and offering expenses paid by us. Each ADS (or 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant to purchase one ADS in lieu thereof) was sold together with a Series D Warrant to purchase one ADS and a Series E Warrant to purchase one ADS. The ADSs and accompanying 2024 Warrants were sold at a combined public offering price of 1.60 and the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants and accompanying 2024 Warrants were sold at a combined public offering price of 1.5999, which is equal to the combined purchase price per ADS and accompanying 2024 Warrants, minus the exercise price of each 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant of 0.0001. As of September 30, 2024 all 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised and are included in issued and outstanding ADSs. The Series D Warrants and the Series E Warrants have an exercise price of 1.60 per share, were exercisable immediately following the closing of the 2024 Offering and expire in two years and five years, respectively, from the closing of the 2024 Offering. In connection with the 2024 Offering, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the 2024 Purchase Agreement dated March 4, 2024, with certain institutional investors signatory thereto, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to such investors, certain of the ADSs, 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants and 2024 Warrants sold in the 2024 Offering. Pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Purchase Agreement, we agreed, subject to certain exceptions, (i) to not enter into variable rate financings for a period of 180 days following the closing of the 2024 Offering, and (ii) to not enter into any equity financings for 90 days from the closing of the 2024 Offering. On March 7, 2024, we also entered into privately negotiated agreements with the holders of certain existing outstanding warrants to purchase up to 638,834 ADSs (the Prior Warrants to, among other things, reduce the exercise price of such Prior Warrants to 1.60 and to extend the current expiration date of the Prior Warrants until March 7, 2029. The incremental fair value of the modified warrants was approximately 209,000, which was accounted for as an offering expense in connection with the 2024 Offering.

 Alumni Equity Line and Purchase Agreement On January 25, 2024, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the Alumni Purchase Agreement with Alumni Capital LP Alumni ). Pursuant to the Alumni Purchase Agreement, we have the right to sell to Alumni up to 8,000,000 (the Commitment Amount of newly issued ordinary shares that are represented by ADS (the Purchase Notice Securities ), subject to certain conditions and limitations, from time to time during the term of the Alumni Purchase Agreement. We do not have the right to commence any sales of ordinary shares represented by ADSs to Alumni under the Alumni Purchase Agreement until the date, which we refer to as the Commencement Date, that all of the conditions set forth in the Alumni Purchase Agreement have been satisfied, including that the registration statement we agreed to file with the SEC pursuant to the Alumni Purchase Agreement is declared effective by the SEC, and our shareholders have approved of the issuance of ADSs under the Alumni Purchase Agreement, which approval was obtained on April 5, 2024. From and after the Commencement Date, we may, from time to time and at our sole discretion for a period of three months, which we at our sole discretion may increase by an additional three months (such period, including any extension, the Commitment Period ), on any business day that we select, direct Alumni to purchase ordinary shares represented by ADSs. The purchase price for the ordinary shares represented by ADSs we may sell to Alumni will be based upon formulas set forth in the Alumni Purchase Agreement based on the then current market price of the ADSs as computed under the Alumni Purchase Agreement and will depend on the type of purchase notice we submit to Alumni from time to time. There is no upper limit on the price per share that Alumni could be obligated to pay for the ADSs under the Alumni Purchase Agreement; provided, however at no time can the purchase price be below a floor price of 1.00 per share (subject to adjustment). We agreed to issue purchase notices for an aggregate of at least 4,000,000 of the Commitment Amount prior to the end of the Commitment Period. As consideration for Alumni s irrevocable commitment to purchase ADSs under the Alumni Purchase Agreement, we agreed to issue to Alumni, at the times set forth in the Alumni Purchase Agreement beginning with the trading day after the Commencement Date, a number of ADSs with a value at the time of issuance not to exceed 240,000 in the aggregate (the Commitment Securities ). The ADSs to be issued will be valued at the average of the closing prices of the ADSs on Nasdaq for the five trading days immediately prior to the date such ADSs are issued. We may pay cash in lieu of issuing all or any portion of the Commitment Securities. In connection with the 2024 Offering, we agreed not to sell any ADS to Alumni under the Alumni Purchase agreement for a period of 180 days from the 2024 Closing Date. As of September 30, 2024 we have not filed the required registration statement or sold any ADS to Alumni under the Alumni Purchase Agreement. Nasdaq Listing On April 29, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (notifying us that the closing bid price per ADS of the Company was below the required minimum of 1.00 for a period of 31 consecutive business days and that we did not meet the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2). Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had a period of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, or until October 28, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement. On October 16, 2024, the Company submitted a letter to Nasdaq requesting an additional 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On October 29, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq granting the Company an additional 180 calendar day grace period, or until April 28, 2025, to regain compliance. The Staff s determination in granting the Company the extension was based on the Company meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and the Company s written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse split, if necessary. Accordingly, there is no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s ADS on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol QNRX.

 Compliance may be achieved without further action if the closing bid price of the Company s ADS is at or above 1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the second compliance period, in which case Nasdaq will notify the Company if it determines the Company is in compliance and the matter will be closed; however Nasdaq could require the closing bid price to equal or to exceed the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for more than 10 consecutive business days before determining that the Company complies. If compliance cannot be demonstrated by April 28, 2025, the Staff will provide written notification that the Company s securities will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal the Staff s determination to a Hearings Panel. If the Company appeals it will be asked to provide a plan to regain compliance to the Panel. Historically, Panels have generally viewed a near-term reverse split as the only definitive plan acceptable to resolve a minimum bid price deficiency. The Company intends to actively monitor the bid price of its ADSs and will consider available options to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. Components of Our Results of Operations Operating Expenses Our current operating expenses consist of two components - research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include personnel costs associated with research and development activities, including third-party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials and manufacture drug supplies and materials. We utilize outside consultants and third parties to conduct the majority of our research and development, under the supervision of our management team. Future research and development expenses may include: employee-related expenses, such as salaries, bonuses and benefits, consultant-related expenses, share-based compensation, overhead related expenses and travel related expenses for our research and development personnel; expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, as well as consultants that support the implementation of the clinical studies described above; manufacturing and packaging costs in connection with conducting clinical trials and for stability and other studies required to support the NDA filing as well as manufacturing drug product for commercial launch; formulation, research and development expenses related to QRX003; and other product candidates we may choose to develop; and costs for sponsored research. 
 Research and development activities will continue to be central to our business plan. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to be significant over the next several years as personnel and compensation costs increase and we conduct late-stage clinical studies and prepare to seek regulatory approval for QRX003 and any other future product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials of QRX003 and any other future product candidate will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: the number of trials required for approval; 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 the per patient trial costs; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of sites included in the trials; the countries in which the trial is conducted; the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; the duration of patient follow-up; the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals; and the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee related expenses including non-cash stock-based compensation, professional fees and other corporate expenses. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities. These increases will likely include compensation and employee-related expenses including stock-based compensation, increased costs related to the potential hiring of personnel, travel costs and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants. Other Expenses (income) Other expenses (income) consist primarily of interest income and unrealized loss (gain) on investments. Results of Operations Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023:

 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were approximately 1,358,000 and 1,366,000, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 9,000, or approximately 1 . The decrease is primarily due to a decreases in legal and professional fees of 59,000, travel related expenses of 91,000 and insurance costs of 31,000, offset by increases in public company costs of 100,000, compensation and benefits of 54,000, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 10,000. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were approximately 1,170,000 and 759,000, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of 412,000, or approximately 54 . The increase was primarily due to 380,000 in increased expenditures on our development programs, including work related to the clinical studies for the development of QRX003, and a increase of 34,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation. See Components of Our Results of Operations - Research and Development Expenses above. We amortize licensed or acquired intellectual property over its expected useful life, included in research and development expenses set out above. Amortization of intangible assets was approximately 25,000 and 26,000 in each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other (Income) and Expenses: We earned approximately 32,000 in unrealized gain and 146,000 in realized and accrued interest income, and approximately 2,000 in unrealized gain and 196,000 in realized and accrued interest income, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 respectively, from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities. Results of Operations Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Operating Expenses General and administrative 4,590,936 4,685,241 (94,305) Research and development 2,532,468 2,475,596 56,872 Total operating expenses 7,123,404 7,160,837 (37,433) Other (income) and expenses Unrealized (gain) loss (23,043) 11,926 (34,969) Realized and accrued interest income (449,163) (536,068) 86,905 Total other income (472,206) (524,142) 51,936 Net loss (6,651,198) (6,636,695) (14,503) General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were approximately 4,591,000 and 4,685,000, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 94,000, or approximately 2 . The decrease was primarily due to decreases in legal and professional fees of 211,000, travel related expenses of 105,000 and insurance costs of 95,000, offset by increases in compensation and benefits of 155,000, public company costs of 107,000 and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 56,000.

 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were approximately 2,532,000 and 2,476,000, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of 57,000, or approximately 2 . The increase was primarily due to 83,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to research and development expenses. This is offset by a decrease of 22,000 in expenditures on our development programs, including work related to the clinical studies for the development of QRX003 and our research collaborations with Queensland University of Technology. See Components of Our Results of Operations - Research and Development Expenses above. We amortize licensed or acquired intellectual property over its expected useful life, included in research and development expenses set out above. Amortization of intangible assets was approximately 75,000 and 78,000 in each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other (Income) and Expenses: We earned approximately 23,000 in unrealized gain and 449,000 in realized and accrued interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we earned approximately 536,000 in realized and accrued interest income and incurred approximately 12,000 in unrealized loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred net losses every year since inception and had an accumulated deficit of approximately 52.9 million at September 30, 2024. We have a limited operating history and have historically funded our operations through debt and equity financings. We incurred net losses of approximately 6.7 million and negative cash flows from operations of 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling 3.1 million and investments of 7.2 million. We have determined that we have sufficient resources to effect our business plan for at least one year from the issuance of the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this report; however, we are subject to risks common to development stage biopharmaceutical companies including, but not limited to, unanticipated clinical trial costs and the ability to estimate such occurrences, if any, on our cash, liquidity, additional financing requirements, and availability. Accordingly, we may need to raise additional funds sooner than planned. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and is subject to significant uncertainty. Additional financing will be required to complete the research and development of our therapeutic targets and our other operating requirements, which may not be available at acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding when it becomes necessary, the development of our product candidates will be impacted and we would likely be forced to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of planned clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities.

Table of Contents 
 Future Funding Requirements We will need to obtain further funding through public or private offerings of our capital stock, debt financing, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources, the requirements for which will depend on many factors, including: the scope, timing, rate of progress and costs of our drug development efforts, preclinical development activities, the timing of laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue; the cost, timing and outcome of preparing for and undergoing regulatory review of our product candidates; the scope and costs of development and commercial manufacturing activities; the cost and timing associated with commercializing our product candidates, if they receive marketing approval; the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of our product candidates and, ultimately, the sale of our products, following FDA approval; our implementation of operational, financial and management systems; and the costs associated with being a public company. 
 Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of QRX003, any future product candidate, or potentially discontinue operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of our equity or convertible debt securities, and pursuant to the exercise of the warrants issued to investors in 2022, 2023 and 2024 public offerings, the ownership interest of our equity holders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our equity holders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or proposed products, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market any future product that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

 Summary Statement of Cash Flows As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 10,307,000 in cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities. The table below presents our cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (5,620,790) (4,640,784) Net cash provided (used) in investing activities 1,290,037 (455,684) Net cash provided by financing activities 5,046,305 5,399,266 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 715,552 302,798 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 5,621,000 and 4,641,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 was mostly due to decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in net loss adjusted for non-cash income and expenses.

Research and Development Commitments In October 2019, Quoin Inc. entered into the Exclusive Licensing Agreement (as amended from time to time, the License Agreement with Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Skinvisible ), under which Skinvisible granted us an exclusive royalty-bearing license relating to the production and manufacture of prescription drug products related to certain patents held by Skinvisible, including those related to QRX003 and QRX004. We made Skinvisible a one-time non-refundable, non-creditable license fee of 1 million (the License Fee ). In addition, we agreed to pay Skinvisible a single digit royalty percentage of our net sales revenues for any licensed product covered by the patent rights licensed under the License Agreement. We also agreed to pay Skinvisible 25 of any revenues we receive as royalties in the event that we sublicense any licensed products to a third party. The License Agreement also requires that we make a 5 million payment to Skinvisible upon receiving approval in the U.S. or European Union, whichever occurs first, for the first drug product developed using intellectual property licensed thereunder. In November 2020, Quoin Inc. entered into a Master Service Agreement with Therapeutics Inc. for the management of the preclinical and clinical development of QRX003 for Netherton Syndrome. The initial term of the agreement was three years with automatic one year extensions, and the agreement required the execution of individual work orders. Quoin Inc. may terminate any work order for any reason with 90 days written notice subject to costs incurred through termination and a defined termination fee, unless there is a material breach by Therapeutics Inc. A work order was entered into in June 2022 for the first QRX003 clinical study at an expected estimated cost of approximately 4.4 million through 2024. An additional work order was entered into in December 2022 for a second QRX003 clinical study at an expected estimated cost of approximately 830,000. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred research and development expenses under these agreements of approximately 275,000 and 926,000, and 155,000 and 1,113,000, respectively.

 In November 2021, we entered into a research agreement with Queensland University of Technology QUT for a pre-clinical research program for the development of a product to treat Netherton Syndrome of approximately 250,000. In May 2022, we entered into a second research agreement with QUT for the development of a product to treat Scleroderma of approximately 610,000. Each agreement remains in place until the completion of the research program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred research and development costs related to these agreements of approximately 0 and 0, and 85,000 and 361,000 respectively. On June 10, 2024, we entered into a research agreement with The School of Pharmacy at UCC. The scope of the agreement encompasses the development of novel topical formulations of Rapamycin (sirolimus) as potential treatments for a number of rare and orphan diseases for which there are currently no approved therapies or cures. Under the terms of the agreement, based on the achievement of certain milestones, we will fund up to approximately 567,000 608,000) plus VAT over an anticipated 2-1/2 year period to support UCC research program to investigate the development of a number of topical rapamycin formulations for future development as potential treatments for several rare and orphan diseases. Following completion of the research program, we will have the option to advance the clinical development of rapamycin formulations developed by UCC. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we did not incur any costs related to this agreement. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from the information provided in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item 3. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15e under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in legal or administrative proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened material legal or administrative proceedings against us. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from the risks previously reported in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the factors discussed in Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our ADSs. Our ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which imposes, among other requirements, a minimum bid requirement. On April 29, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that for the preceding 31 consecutive business days (March 14, 2024 through April 26, 2024), our ADSs did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 Minimum Bid Price Requirement per ADS as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until October 28, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On October 16, 2024, the Company submitted a letter to Nasdaq requesting an additional 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On October 29, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq granting the Company an additional 180 calendar day grace period, or until April 28, 2025, to regain compliance. The Staff s determination in granting the Company the extension was based on the Company meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and the Company s written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse split, if necessary. Compliance may be achieved without further action if the closing bid price of the Company s ADS is at or above 1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the second compliance period, in which case Nasdaq will notify the Company if it determines the Company is in compliance and the matter will be closed; however Nasdaq could require the closing bid price to equal or to exceed the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for more than 10 consecutive business days before determining that the Company complies. If compliance cannot be demonstrated by April 28, 2025, the Staff will provide written notification that the Company s securities will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal the Staff s determination to a Hearings Panel. If we cannot regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or if we otherwise fail to meet any of Nasdaq s listing standards, our ADSs will be subject to delisting. If that were to occur, our ADSs would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our ADSs. This would adversely affect the ability of investors to trade our ADSs and would adversely affect the value of our ADSs. Delisting from Nasdaq would cause us to pursue eligibility for trading of our ADSs on other markets or exchanges, or on an over-the-counter market. In such case, our stockholders ability to trade or obtain quotations of the market value of our ADSs would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices of these securities. There can be no assurance that our ADSs, if delisted from the Nasdaq, would be listed on a national securities exchange, a national quotation service or the over-the-counter markets. Delisting from the Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity, adversely affect the market liquidity of our ADSs, decrease securities analysts coverage of us or diminish investor, supplier and employee confidence.

 The delisting of our ADSs from Nasdaq may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms in the future, or at all. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our ADSs and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our ADSs when you wish to do so. Further, if our ADSs were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our ADSs would cease to be recognized as a covered security, and we would be subject to additional regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Moreover, there is no assurance that any actions that we take to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement would stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our ADSs, prevent our ADSs from falling below the Nasdaq minimum bid price required for continued listing again or prevent future non-compliance with other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders equity or market values of our ADSs, our ADSs could be delisted. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information. During the third quarter of 2024, none of our directors or executive officers or any Rule 10b5-1 or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Registration S-K).
