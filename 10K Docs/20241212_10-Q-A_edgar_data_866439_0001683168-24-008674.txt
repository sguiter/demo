no longer raises serious concerns about the viability of the Optilan (UK) Limited entity and related operations of the Optilan subsidiaries. 

The Company will require additional funding during
the next twelve months to finance the growth of its current operations and achieve its strategic objectives. These factors, as well as
the uncertain conditions that the Company faces relative to capital raising activities, create substantial doubt as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is seeking to raise additional capital principally through private placement offerings
and is targeting strategic partners in an effort to finalize the development of its products and begin generating revenues. The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of future capital offerings or alternative financing arrangements
or expansion of its operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management is actively pursuing additional sources of financing sufficient
to generate enough cash flow to fund its operations for twelve months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements.
However, management cannot make any assurances that such financing will be secured.

The Company has accounted for the purchase using
the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations under ASC 805. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the
underlying assets and liabilities in proportion to their respective fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the
estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities for the fair value of the assets and liabilities recognized at the date of acquisition:

Contracts 

Contract revenue is recognized over time using
the cost-to-cost measure of progress for fixed price contracts. The cost-to-cost measure of progress best depicts the continuous transfer
of control of goods or services to the customer. The contractual terms provide that the customer compensates the Company for services
rendered. 

Contract costs include all direct materials, labor
and subcontracted costs, as well as indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and
the costs of capital equipment. The cost estimation and review process for recognizing revenue over time under the cost-to-cost method
is based on the professional knowledge and experience of the Company s project managers, engineers and financial professionals.
Management reviews estimates of total contract transaction price and total project costs on an ongoing basis. Changes in job performance,
job conditions and management s assessment of expected variable consideration are factors that influence estimates of the total
contract transaction price, total costs to complete those contracts and profit recognition. Changes in these factors could result in revisions
to revenue and costs of revenue in the period in which the revisions are determined on a prospective basis, which could materially affect
the Company s consolidated results of operations for that period. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in
the period in which such losses are determined. 

Performance Obligations 

A performance obligation is a contractual promise
to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to distinct performance obligations and recognized as revenue when or as the
performance obligations are satisfied. The Company s contracts often require significant integrated services and, even when delivering
multiple distinct services, are generally accounted for as a single performance obligation. Contract amendments and change orders are
generally not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integrated service provided in the context of the contract and
are accounted for as a modification of the existing contract and performance obligation. The majority of the Company s performance
obligations are completed within one year. 

When more than one contract is entered into with
a customer on or close to the same date, the Company evaluates whether those contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single
contract as well as whether those contracts should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires
significant judgment and is based on the facts and circumstances of the various contracts, which could change the amount of revenue and
profit recognition in a given period depending upon the outcome of the evaluation. 

Contract Assets and Liabilities 

The Company bill its customers based on contractual
terms, including, milestone billings based on the completion of certain phases of the work. Sometimes, billing occurs after revenue recognition,
resulting in unbilled revenue, which is accounted for as a contract asset. Sometimes the Company receives advances payments from our customers
before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue, which is accounted for as a contract liability. 

Contract assets in the consolidated balance sheets
represents costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, which arise when revenue has been recorded but the amount has not been
billed. 

Contract liabilities on September 30, 2024 are upon the deconsolidation
related to the Optilan liquidation. 

Variable Consideration 

Transaction pricing for the Company s contracts
may include variable consideration, such as unapproved change orders, claims, incentives and liquidated damages. Management estimates
variable consideration for a performance obligation utilizing estimation methods that best predict the amount of consideration to which
the Company will be entitled. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that
a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration
is resolved. Management s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in transaction
price are based on past practices with the customer, specific discussions, correspondence or preliminary negotiations with the customer,
legal evaluations and all other relevant information that is reasonably available. The effect of a change in variable consideration on
the transaction price of a performance obligation is typically recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis.
To the extent unapproved change orders, claims and liquidated damages reflected in transaction price are not resolved in the Company s
favor, or to the extent incentives reflected in transaction price are not earned, there could be reductions in, or reversals of, previously
recognized revenue.

Patents - Intrusion Detection Intellectual Property 

The Company relies on patent laws and restrictions
on disclosure to protect its intellectual property rights. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company held three U.S. and foreign
patents on its intrusion detection technology, which expire in calendar years 2025 through 2034 (depending on the payment of maintenance
fees). 

The DPTI issued patents cover a System and Method
for Brillouin Analysis, a System and Method for Resolution Enhancement of a Distributed Sensor, and a Flexible Fiber Optic Deformation
System Sensor and Method. Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business. Any patents
that may be issued may not sufficiently protect the Company's intellectual property and third parties may challenge any issued patents.
Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to the Company.
The Company cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will prevent the misappropriation of its intellectual property, particularly
in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Further, the Company may be required
to enforce its intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial
costs and diversion of management's attention. Additionally, there may be existing patents of which the Company is unaware that could
be pertinent to its business, and it is not possible to know whether there are patent applications pending that the Company's products
might infringe upon, since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, the Company had patent amortization costs on its intrusion detection technology totaling and respectively. Patents
costs are being amortized over the remaining life of each patent, which is from .

informal briefing in response to two questions: (a) Did the time to appeal the December 27, 2024 amended judgment expire on February
26, 2024; and (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, must this appeal be dismissed as untimely. On or about April 4, 2024, DarkPulse filed
its informal briefing in response with the Appellate Court. The Company is currently awaiting a decision from the Appellate Court.

facility and is located at 2640 W Medtronic Way Tempe, AZ 85281. Currently, we do not have access to the facility nor have we signed a

investigating potential legal claims, including but not limited to stock fraud, market manipulation, and/or defamation, against certain
Twitter accounts, websites, and social media channels. The investigation is ongoing and should potential claims be identified, we will
evaluate commencing formal litigation proceedings.

claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not currently involved in any pending legal proceeding or
litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party or to

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

This Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain certain forward-looking statements. Historical results may not indicate future
performance. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events; are based on assumptions and are subject to
known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.
Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to, those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including any changes that might result from any
facts, events, or circumstances after the date hereof that may bear upon forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee
future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The following discussions are based upon our consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the Company s financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these financial statements include,
but are not limited to, assumptions used to calculate derivative liabilities, revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it believes
to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates when there are changes in circumstances,
facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill 

The Company accounts for long-lived assets in
accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant and Equipment, Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. This
accounting standard requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair
value of the asset. 

Indefinite-lived intangible assets established
in connection with business combinations consist of the tradename. The impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets
consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles
with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value
of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. This guidance simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2
of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. The quantitative impairment test calculates
any goodwill impairment as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying
amount of goodwill. It is our practice, at a minimum, to perform a qualitative or quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth
quarter every year. The Company has one reporting unit it evaluates during its impairment test. 

In determining the fair value of the reporting
unit, management estimated the price that would be received to sell the reporting unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. This includes reviewing market comparables such as revenue multipliers and assigning certain assets
and liabilities to the reporting units, such as the respective working capital deficits of each entity and debt obligations that would
need to be assumed by a market participant buyer in an orderly transaction. The Company calculated the carrying amounts of the reporting
unit by utilizing the entities assets and liabilities at December 31, 2023, including the carrying value of the identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill assigned to the respective reporting unit.

upon the Optilan UK Liquidation.

Revenue Recognition 

The Company s revenues are generated primarily
from the sale of our services, which consist primarily of advanced technology solutions for integrated communications and security systems,
as well as habitat management. The Company s sales of products are primarily generated from our TJM subsidiaries. Sales of products
and services are separate from one another. At contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in the contract with customers
and identify a performance obligation for each. To determine the performance obligation, we consider all products and services promised
in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or implied by customary business practices. The timing of satisfaction
of the performance obligation is not subject to significant judgment. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration expected to be
received in exchange for transferring goods and services. We recognize service revenues as the performance obligations are met, which
is generally as milestones are satisfied over time. We generally recognize product revenues at the time of shipment, provided that all
other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 

The Company recognizes revenue when its customer
obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for
those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606,
we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize
revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. The five-step model is applied to contracts when it is probable that we will
collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services transferred to the customer. At contract inception,
once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine
those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize revenue in the
amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is
satisfied. 

The Company considers each individual sale of
service contract to be its own performance obligation. Services in the contract are highly interdependent and interrelated, and the successful
completion of each milestone is necessary for the overall success of the contract. Therefore, each milestone is not separately identifiable
from other promises in the contract, and not distinct and ultimately not individual performance obligations. 

The Company records revenue over time using the
output measure as it is the most faithful depiction of an entity s performance because it directly measures the value of the goods
and services transferred to the customer. The Company utilizes the Right to Invoice for these contracts, as the pricing structure is based
on various milestones that are specified in the contract. These milestones include Construction Phase Plan, Start of the construction
phase, installation phase, site surveys, fiber splicing, recoveries, and closeouts. There are specified payments associated with these
milestones in the contract, and the value allocated is commensurate with work done. In the event that there are advances such as upfront
retainers and not based on the value, those are recorded as contract liabilities. 

In accordance with ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedient , which is to (1) clarify the objective
of the collectability criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for
all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract
inception; (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before
the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the
transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that a completed
contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP
before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each
prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. The amendments of this
ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. There was no impact
as a result of adopting this ASU on the financial statements and related disclosures. Based on the terms and conditions of the product
arrangements, the Company believes that its products and services can be accounted for separately as its products and services have value
to the Company s customers on a stand-alone basis. When a transaction involves more than one product or service, revenue is allocated
to each deliverable based on its relative fair value; otherwise, revenue is recognized as products are delivered or as services are provided
over the term of the customer contract.

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company evaluates the embedded conversion
feature within its convertible debt instruments under ASC 815-15 and ASC 815-40 to determine if the conversion feature meets the definition
of a liability and, if so, whether to bifurcate the conversion feature and account for it as a separate derivative liability. For derivative
financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is
then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative
financial instruments, the Company uses a lattice model, in accordance with ASC 815-15 , Derivative and Hedging, to value the derivative
instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments
should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are
classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required
within 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Change in Ownership in Previously Consolidated Subsidiary Results
in Deconsolidation in the Current Period 

On June 28, 2023, the county court at Portsmouth,
England made a winding up order raised by a (non-related party) creditor against the Company's subsidiary Optilan (UK) Limited. The subsidiary
on that date ceased conducting further business and the director s powers terminated. The consolidation of subsidiaries owned by
Optilan (UK) Limited was no longer under its control as defined by ASC 810 (Consolidation). This compulsory liquidation resulted in a
combined Loss on Deconsolidation of Optilan (UK) Limited and its subsidiaries in the amount of 1,642,795. 

The subsidiaries of Optilan (UK) Limited are solvent
and continue to operate. The Company will retain no measurable residual value nor direct or indirect investment in Optilan, its subsidiaries
or its assets. The Company will have no continuing involvement with Optilan (UK) Limited, including its subsidiaries, and will not be
owned or controlled by any related party of the Company. 

Recent Events 

Liquidation/winding up of Optilan (UK) Limited 

On May 3, 2023, Eversheds Sutherland (International)
LLP, a creditor of Optilan (UK) Limited, filed a petition to wind up (the Winding up Petition Optilan (UK) Limited,
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company s Subsidiary, Optilan HoldCo 3 Limited, and the matter was due to be heard in the Portsmouth
Combined Court Centre on June 28, 2023. 

On June 28, 2023, the High Court of Justice in
the United Kingdom issued a winding-up order for the liquidation and winding up of the affairs of Optilan (UK) Limited (the Optilan
Liquidation ). In conjunction with the order, the court appointed the Offical Receiver s Office (the OR to take the appointment as liquidator of Optilan (UK) Limited and take control of Optilan (UK) Limited s assets. 

At the same time the court appointed the OR to
take the appointment as liquidator of Optilan (UK) Limited. The OR has taken control of Optilan (UK) Limited s assets. To date the
ORs Office has initiated contact with Optilan but we still wait to receive details of the individual who will be taking the role of OR. 

On July 3, 2023, Optilan (UK) Limited received
a letter from The Insolvency Service, an executive agency sponsored by the Department for Business and Trade located in the U.K. Pursuant
to the letter of The Insolvency Services, the Company was required to provide information relating to Optilan (UK) Limited to the Official
Receiver s Office (a government body of Plymouth, the United Kingdom) and attend an interview with staff of the Official Receiver s
Office to review the prospect of recovering the assets of Optilan (UK) Limited for the benefit of creditors. The interview was scheduled
for July 18, 2023. 

39 

On July 18, 2023, the interview was held between
the Official Receiver s Office OR and the CEO at time of dissolution. The OR office requested a list of assets,
bank account information and amounts along with any contracts held by Optilan (UK) Limited to begin the liquidation process. 

On August 9, 2023, Evelyn Partners was appointed
Joint Liquidator. 

There are no new claims against Optilan (UK) Limited
and Evelyn Partners continue to liquidate the company s assets. 

The Company is an Unsecured creditor of Optilan
(UK) Limited and is at risk of losing any repayment of obligations due from Optilan (UK) Limited because there are several intercompany
relationships between the Company and Optilan (UK) Limited, the financial impact of any future claims and liabilities may not be known
for several months. The Company has approximately 19.4 million intercompany payables due from Optilan (UK), which will increase the Company
liabilities for any obligations not repaid. The remaining assets held by Optilan (UK) Limited were fully impaired in 2023 as a result
of the winding-up order for liquidation. 

Nine-Months Ended September 30, 2024 Accounting Ana ly sis 

The Company performed an analysis of the trade
receivables related to Optilan (UK) Limited and determined that an additional 2,422,457 may not be collectible pursuant to Optilan Liquidation.
The Company recorded a bad debt provision for this amount. 

As a result of Optilan Liquidation as described
in Note 1, management determined that certain events and circumstances occurred that indicated that the carrying amount of the Company s
reporting unit may not be recoverable. The qualitative assessment was primarily due to the customer contracts held by Optilan (UK) Limited
and the associated revenue projections by the UK subsidiary that is subject to the potential winding up. As such, the Company compared
the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amounts and recorded an impairment loss of 2,037,670 pertaining to impairment and
goodwill in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible asset of 356,260,
and impairment of goodwill of 1,681,410. The Company has one reporting unit which was evaluated in the impairment test noted above.
As a result of the impairment, the Company had a carrying value of 0 pertaining to goodwill and intangible assets as of September 30,
2024. 

Optilan (UK) Limited became subject to the control
of a government and was appointed an administrator. In this situation, when the parent ceases to have a financial interest in a subsidiary
and does not retain an investment in that subsidiary, the parent should deconsolidate the subsidiary and recognize a gain or loss on deconsolidation
in accordance with ASC 810-10-40-5. 

In addition, ASC 810-10-40-3A states when a parent
deconsolidates a subsidiary or derecognizes a group of assets, the parent no longer controls the subsidiary's assets and liabilities or
the group of assets. The parent therefore shall derecognize the assets, liabilities, and equity components related to that subsidiary
or group of assets. The equity components will include any noncontrolling interest as well as amounts previously recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive income. If the subsidiary or group of assets being deconsolidated or derecognized is a foreign entity (or represents
the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which it resides), then the amount of accumulated other comprehensive
income that is reclassified and included in the calculation of gain or loss shall include any foreign currency translation adjustment
related to that foreign entity. 

Upon the liquidation, on June 28, 2023, the Company
derecognized Optilan UK s assets and liabilities and recorded a loss on consolidation of 1,624,795, which was recognized in other
income (expenses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Included in the loss on consolidation of 1,642,795
are the gains on intercompany receivables and payables and currency translation adjustment 12,721,532 and 1,545,008 respectively, offset
by the net loss on impairment of investments of 12,623. 

In addition, the allowance of 2,422,457 was recorded
against receivables that have been deemed uncollectible.

Prior

Going Concern Uncertainty 

As shown in the accompanying financial statements,
we generated net losses of 3,540,148 and 19,915,940 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net cash
provided (used) in operating activities of 29,782 4,066,096, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s current
liabilities exceeded its current assets by 20,535,287 and has an accumulated deficit of 70,910,772. As of September 30, 2024, the
Company had 165,186 of cash. Lastly, the Optilan Liquidation no longer raises serious concerns about the viability of the Optilan (UK)
Limited entities. Optilan (UK) Limited and its subsidiaries have been deconsolidated and are no longer under the control of DarkPulse,
Inc. 

We will require additional funding to finance
the growth of our operations and achieve our strategic objectives. These factors, as relative to capital raising activities, create substantial
doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We are seeking to raise additional capital and are targeting strategic partners
in an effort to accelerate the sales and marketing of our products and begin generating revenues. Our ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon the success of future capital offerings or alternative financing arrangements, expansion of our operations and generating
sales. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as
a going concern. Management is actively pursuing additional sources of financing sufficient to generate enough cash flow to fund its operations;
however, management cannot make any assurances that such financing will be secured. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively
affect the Company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust
local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.

Results of Operations 

Revenues 

The Company s revenues are generated primarily
from the sale of our services, which consist primarily of advanced technology solutions for integrated communications and security systems,
as well as habitat management. The Company s sales of products are primarily generated from our TJM subsidiaries. 

The Company s future revenues will be derived
from the following, among other things. 

promote adoption if our patented technology through agency and distribution agreements; 

cross-selling existing customer with products from other subsidiaries; 

provide a wide array of diverse services, including enhanced or additional services that may become available in the future due to, among other things, advances in technology or improvements in our infrastructure; 

pursue acquisitions of additional assets, in each case if available at attractive prices; and 

market our products and services to new customers. 

While the Company recognizes revenue when its
customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange
for those goods or services, the Company also maintains multiple contracts for future material revenues, including part of framework contracts
that will be recognized during future reporting periods.

of continuing operations of 3,540,148 and 19,915,940 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We require working capital to fund the continued
development and commercialization of our proprietary fiber optic sensing devices, and for operating expenses. 

During the three-months ended September 30, 2024,
we had 474,205 in cash proceeds from our equity financings compared to 334,115 in 2023. 

During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024,
we had 696,205 in cash proceeds from our equity financings compared to 3,090,717 in 2023. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 165,579
compared to 11,912 as of December 31, 2023. We currently do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next 12 months and
we will require working capital to complete development, testing and marketing of our products and to pay for ongoing operating expenses.
We anticipate adding consultants for technology development and the corresponding operations of the Company, but this will not occur prior
to obtaining additional capital. Management is currently in the process of looking for additional investors. Currently, loans from banks
or other lending sources for lines of credit or similar short-term borrowings are not available to us. We have been able to raise working
capital to fund operations through the issuances of convertible notes or obtained through the issuance of our restricted common stock.
As of September 30, 2024, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by 20,535,288. 

Several of our significant operating subsidiaries
have borrowed funds from DarkPulse. The terms of the instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowers or borrowing groups may
restrict our ability to access their accumulated cash. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries
may be limited by tax, legal and other considerations. 

Our executive officers and our Board of Directors
review our sources and potential uses of cash in connection with our annual budgeting process and whenever circumstances warrant. Generally
speaking, our principal funding source is cash from financing activities, and our principal cash requirements include loans to our operating
subsidiaries, operating expenses, and capital expenditures, 

45 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

During the nine-months ended September 30,
2024, net cash used in operating activities netwas 29,782 resulting from our net loss of 3,540,148 partially offset by non-cash charges
of 1,808,120 primarily driven by our loss on equity investment resulting from the SPAC termination. In 2023, we had cash
used in operating activities of 4,066,096 resulting from our net loss of 19,915,940, partially offset by non-cash charges of 13,322,329
primarily driven by impairment charges, bad debt expense and the issuance of common stock for a legal settlement. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash used
in investing activities of 120,248. 

During the nine-months ended September 30, 2023,
we had net cash used in investing activities of 1,409,128, including 563,317 in notes and 630,337 in advances to GSD, as well as our
joint venture investment of 113,124 and purchase of property and equipment of 102,350. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash provided by financing activities was 1,623,081 of which 1,043,131 was comprised of proceeds from the issuance of common stock. 

During the nine-months ended September 30, 2023,
net cash provided by financing activities was 3,090,717 which was comprised of proceeds from convertible notes of 50,000 and the sale
of common stock of 3,067,764, less repayments of loans 27,047. 

Factors That May Affect Future Results 

Management s Discussion and Analysis contains
information based on management s beliefs and forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.
There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,
including but not limited to, our ability to obtain the equity funding or borrowings necessary to market and launch our products, our
ability to successfully serially produce and market our products; our success establishing and maintaining collaborative licensing and
supplier arrangements; the acceptance of our products by customers; our continued ability to pay operating costs; our ability to meet
demand for our products; the amount and nature of competition from our competitors; the effects of technological changes on products and
product demand; and our ability to successfully adapt to market forces and technological demands of our customers. 

46 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08,
 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , issued
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This ASU requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities
acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The update will
generally result in the recognition of contract assets and contract liabilities at amounts consistent with those recorded by the acquiree
immediately before the acquisition date rather than at fair value. The Company expects that there would be no material impact on the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of this ASU. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, which
simplifies the guidance on the issuer s accounting for convertible debt instruments by removing the separation models for convertible
debt with a cash conversion feature and convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, entities will not separately
present in equity an embedded conversion feature in such debt and will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt, unless
certain other conditions are met. The elimination of these models will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income
for entities that have issued a convertible instrument that is within the scope of ASU 2020-06. ASU 2020-06 is applicable for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company
adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

47 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, the Company has elected not to provide
the disclosure required by this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have established disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, as such, is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive
Officer, Dennis O Leary, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Mr. O Leary, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rule 13a- 15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on his evaluation, Mr. O Leary concluded that
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

We have taken limited steps to meet our Sarbanes-Oxley
(SOX) Section 404 compliance requirements and implement procedures to assure financial reports are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and therefore fairly represent the results and condition of the Company. We are not materially compliant
with the Section 404 requirements due to economic constraints.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Carebourn Capital, L.P. v. DarkPulse, Inc. 

On or about January 29, 2021, Carebourn Capital,
L.P. Carebourn commenced an action against the Company in Minnesota State Court. Carebourn alleged that the Company was
in breach of certain securities purchase agreements and convertible promissory notes sold to Carebourn on or about July 17, 2018 and
July 24, 2018. 

On or about August 31, 2021, the Company answered
Carebourn s complaint and interposed affirmative defenses, including that Carebourn was an unregistered dealer, as
such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act and, therefore, all contracts between the parties
arising from or related to the securities purchase agreements and convertible promissory notes sold to Carebourn on or about July 17,
2018 and July 24, 2018 were void pursuant to the Exchange Act. The Company also asserted counterclaims against Carebourn under the Minnesota
Securities Act. 

On or about April 21, 2023, the State Court ruled
in the Company s favor on its motion for partial summary judgment on its Exchange Act defense, holding that (i) Carebourn is a
 dealer under the Exchange Act in violation of the mandatory registration requirement imposed thereby, and (ii) all contracts
between the parties are void. 

On or about November 17, 2023, the State Court
ruled in the Company s favor on its motion for summary judgment on its Minnesota Securities Act counterclaims against Carebourn
and awarded damages for Carebourn s violation of Minn. Stat. 80A.76(d) in the amount of 124,012.91, attorney s fees
in the amount of 239,923.33 and costs in the amount of 23,757.24 (or a total award in the amount of 387,693.48). 

On or about March 23, 2024, Carebourn appealed the final judgment
entered by the State Court against Carebourn and in favor of the Company. 

On or about March 25, 2024, the Minnesota Appellate
Court entered an Order, noting that Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 104.01 provides that appeals must be taken within 60 days of the date of the
final judgment and, therefore, it appears that Carebourn failed to timely take its appeal. The Appellate Court requested the parties
submit informal briefing in response to two questions: (a) Did the time to appeal the December 27, 2024 amended judgment expire on February
26, 2024; and (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, must this appeal be dismissed as untimely. On or about April 4, 2024, DarkPulse filed
its informal briefing in response with the Appellate Court. The Company is currently awaiting a decision from the Appellate Court. 

As of November 5, 2024, the final judgment has
not been satisfied by Carebourn. DarkPulse intends to continue to exercise all legal rights and remedies available to it to collect the
amounts awarded should Carebourn fail to voluntarily pay the same. 

More Capital, LLC v. DarkPulse, Inc. et al 

On or about June 29, 2021, More Capital, LLC More commenced an action against the Company in Minnesota State Court. More alleged that the Company was in breach of
a certain securities purchase agreement and convertible promissory note sold to More on or about August 20, 2018. 

49 

On or about September 3, 2021, the Company answered
More s complaint and interposed affirmative defenses, including that More was an unregistered dealer, as such term
is defined in the Exchange Act and, therefore, all contracts between the parties arising from or related to the securities purchase agreement
and convertible promissory note sold to More on or about August 20, 2018 were void pursuant to the Exchange Act. The Company also asserted
counterclaims against More under the Minnesota Securities Act. 

On or about December 11, 2023, the Minnesota
State Court ruled in the Company s favor on its motion for summary judgment on its (a) Exchange Act defense, holding that (1) More
is a dealer under the Exchange Act in violation of the mandatory registration requirement imposed thereby, and (ii) all

violation of Minn. Stat. 80A.76(d) in the amount of 300,809.39, attorney s fees in the amount of 110,029.00 and costs
in the amount of 210.25 (or a total award in the amount of 412,048.64). 

On or about March 23, 2024, More appealed the final judgment entered
by the State Court against More and in favor of the Company. 

On or about March 25, 2024, the Minnesota Appellate
Court entered an Order, noting that Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 104.01 provides that appeals must be taken within 60 days of the date of the
final judgment and, therefore, it appears that More failed to timely take its appeal. The Appellate Court requested the parties submit
informal briefing in response to two questions: (a) Did the time to appeal the December 27, 2024 amended judgment expire on February
26, 2024; and (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, must this appeal be dismissed as untimely. On or about April 4, 2024, DarkPulse filed
its informal briefing in response with the Appellate Court. The Company is currently awaiting a decision from the Appellate Court. 

As of November 5, 2024, the final judgment has

the Company s motion for sanctions against the Noteholders and their counsel of record. As of the date hereof, the Company has submitted

disputes with one of its lenders, GS Capital Partners LLC GS ), on terms mutually agreeable to both Darkpulse and GS. Specifically,
DarkPulse and GS compromised over 2,600,000 of debt owed to GS in return for issuing shares to GS, as provided by the settlement agreement
between the parties. This settlement is expected to be approved by the District Court for Clark County, Nevada,on or about August 15,
2024, and such approval will also resolve the collaborative proceeding initiated in such court to obtain approval of the settlement under
Section 3(A)(10) of the Securities Act. Importantly, through this settlement, DarkPulse was able to negotiate a strict leak-out clause
concerning the shares issued to GS, which DarkPulse believes will allow it to maintain its going concern value without the distraction
of expensive and protracted litigation. 

TJM West, Inc v Thomas J McCarthy Family Limited
Partnership 

On or about July 25,2023 TJM West filed an action
in Maricopa court against its landlord for illegal lockout from the company s facilities. 

On or about August 18,2023 TJM West s motion
for Temporary Restraining Order was granted. 

September 27, 2023 TJM West counsel motion to
withdraw was accepted. 

On or about October 6, 2923. TJM West hired new
counsel to assist with a short deadline to file answers to landlords motion. 

On or about November 6,2023 TJM West and its
counsel mutually agreed to a withdrawal. 

On or about November 6,2023 TJM West engaged
new counsel. 

On or about May 8,2024 TJM West dropped its motion
for Temporary Restraining Order. 

On or about May 24,2024 TJM West counsel filed
motion to continue discovery. 

On or about May 24,2024 TJM West s counsel
left the firm handling the litigation it was determined in the best interest of the company to terminate its relationship with the law
firm. As of today the company is interviewing new counsel and evaluating its claims against landlord to determine if it s financially
responsible to incur additional fees related to exercising TJM s right against the landlord for terminating the lease. 

On or about June 28, 2024, the Company discussed with possible new
counsel the feasibility of recovering its damages utilizing the courts. At that time, it appeared the cost of recovery would exceed the
recoverable amount should the Company be successful in its litigation. TJM West is awaiting updates from the court in Maricopa County
as to the status of the case. 

The facilities in question had served as TJM West s manufacturing
facility and is located at 2640 W Medtronic Way Tempe, AZ 85281. Currently, we do not have access to the facility nor have we signed a
new lease signed with the landlord. 

In addition to the foregoing Legal Proceedings, we are also actively
investigating potential legal claims, including but not limited to stock fraud, market manipulation, and/or defamation, against certain
Twitter accounts, websites, and social media channels. The investigation is ongoing and should potential claims be identified, we will
evaluate commencing formal litigation proceedings. 

From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to
claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not currently involved in any pending legal proceeding or
litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party or to
which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and operating results.
