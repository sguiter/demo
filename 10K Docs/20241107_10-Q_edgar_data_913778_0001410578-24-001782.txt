Critical Accounting Estimates In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity VIE in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors. A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.

Table of Contents 
 Based on this guidance, management has determined that while the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE, the Operating Partnerships should not be consolidated with the Fund because the Fund does not have the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnerships which are significant to their performance and is therefore not a primary beneficiary of the Operating Partnerships. The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements. The Fund s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss. The Fund s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.
