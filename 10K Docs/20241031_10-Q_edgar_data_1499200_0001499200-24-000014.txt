 We value the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives using a market or option-based approach incorporating present value techniques, as needed, which incorporates observable commodity price curves, when available, and other relevant data. 
 
 We include a significant portion of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy as the fair value is developed through the use of internal models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants may use in valuing the asset or liability. To the extent valued using an option pricing model, we consider the future prices of energy units for unobservable periods to be a significant unobservable input to estimated net fair value. In estimating the future prices of energy units, we make judgments about market risk related to liquidity of commodity indices and volatility utilizing available market data. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments. We derive our volatility assumptions based on observed historical settled global LNG market pricing or accepted proxies for global LNG market pricing as well as settled domestic natural gas pricing. Such volatility assumptions also contemplate, as of the balance sheet date, observable forward curve data of such indices, as well as evolving available industry data and independent studies. 
 
 In developing our volatility assumptions, we acknowledge that the global LNG industry is inherently influenced by events such as unplanned supply constraints, geopolitical incidents, unusual climate events including drought and uncommonly mild, by historical standards, winters and summers, and real or threatened disruptive operational impacts to global energy infrastructure. Our current estimate of volatility includes the impact of otherwise rare events unless we believe market participants would exclude such events on account of their assertion that those events were specific to our company and deemed within our control. Our fair value estimates incorporate market participant-based assumptions pertaining to certain contractual uncertainties, including those related to the availability of market information for delivery points, as well as the timing of satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. We may recognize changes in fair value through earnings that could significantly impact our results of operations if and when such uncertainties are resolved.

(1) billion of the fair value of our senior notes were classified as Level 3 since these senior notes were valued by applying an unobservable illiquidity adjustment to the price derived from trades or indicative bids of instruments with similar terms, maturities and credit standing. The remainder of the fair value of our senior notes are classified as Level 2, based on prices derived from trades or indicative bids of the instruments. 
 
 The estimated fair value of our Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 approximated the principal amount outstanding because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates and the debt may be repaid, in full or in part, at any time without penalty.

 Introduction 
 
 The following discussion and analysis presents management s view of our business, financial condition and overall performance and should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. This information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future.

Overview 
 
 We are a Delaware limited liability company formed by CQP. We provide clean, secure and affordable LNG to integrated energy companies, utilities and energy trading companies around the world. We aspire to conduct our business in a safe and responsible manner, delivering a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers. 
 
 LNG is natural gas (methane) in liquid form. The LNG we produce is shipped all over the world, converted back into natural gas (called regasification and then transported via pipeline to homes and businesses and used as an energy source that is essential for heating, cooking, other industrial uses and back up for intermittent energy sources. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning, abundant and affordable source of energy. When LNG is converted back to natural gas, it can be used instead of coal, which reduces the amount of pollution traditionally produced from burning fossil fuels, like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter that enters the air we breathe. Additionally, compared to coal, it produces significantly fewer carbon emissions. By liquefying natural gas, we are able to reduce its volume by 600 times so that we can load it onto special LNG carriers designed to keep the LNG cold and in liquid form for efficient transport overseas. 
 
 We own six operational Trains, for a total production capacity of approximately 30 mtpa of LNG (the Liquefaction Project ), at a natural gas liquefaction and export facility located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana at Sabine Pass (the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal ), one of the largest LNG production facilities in the world. The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include five LNG storage tanks and three marine berths owned and operated by SPLNG, a subsidiary of CQP, and a 94-mile natural gas supply pipeline owned and operated by CTPL, a subsidiary of CQP. 
 
 Our long-term customer arrangements form the foundation of our business and provide us with significant, stable, long-term cash flows. We have contracted most of our anticipated production capacity under SPAs, in which our customers are generally required to pay a fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes irrespective of their election to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, and under an IPM agreement, in which a gas producer sells natural gas to us on a global LNG or natural gas index price, less a fixed liquefaction fee, shipping and other costs. The SPAs also have a variable fee component, which is generally structured to cover the cost of natural gas purchases, transportation and liquefaction fuel consumed to produce LNG. Since we procure most of our feedstock for LNG production from the U.S., the structure of these contracts helps limit our exposure to fluctuations in U.S. natural gas prices. Through our SPAs and IPM agreement, we have contracted approximately 80 of the total anticipated production from the Liquefaction Project with approximately 14 years of weighted average remaining life as of September 30, 2024, excluding volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation. 
 
 We remain focused on safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Increasing demand for LNG has allowed us to expand our liquefaction infrastructure in a financially disciplined manner. We have increased available liquefaction

 capacity at our Liquefaction Project as a result of debottlenecking and other optimization projects. We believe these factors provide a foundation for additional growth in our portfolio of customer contracts in the future. We hold a significant land position at the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal, which provides opportunity for further liquefaction capacity expansion. A subsidiary of CQP is developing an expansion adjacent to the Liquefaction Project with a total production capacity of up to approximately 20 mtpa of LNG, inclusive of estimated debottlenecking opportunities (the Expansion Project ). In February 2024, we and other subsidiaries of CQP submitted an application to the FERC under the Natural Gas Act (the NGA for authorization to site, construct and operate the Expansion Project, as well as an application to the DOE requesting authorization to export LNG to FTA countries and non-FTA countries, both of which applications exclude debottlenecking. This expansion may be developed and constructed by an affiliate of ours outside of the Liquefaction Project. The development of the Expansion Project or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before a positive FID is made. 
 Additionally, we are committed to the management of our most important ESG impacts, risks and opportunities. In August 2024, Cheniere published Energy Secured, Benefits Delivered , its fifth Corporate Responsibility CR report, which details its approach and progress on ESG matters. Cheniere s CR report is available at cheniere.com/our-responsibility/reporting-center. Information on Cheniere s website, including the CR report, is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview of Significant Events 
 
 Our significant events since January 1, 2024 and through the filing date of this Form 10-Q include the following: 
 Strategic 
 
 In February 2024, we and other subsidiaries of CQP submitted an application to the FERC under the NGA for authorization to site, construct and operate the Expansion Project, as well as an application to the DOE requesting authorization to export LNG to FTA countries and non-FTA countries, both of which applications exclude debottlenecking. In October 2024, the authorization from the DOE to export LNG to FTA countries was received. 
 
 Operational 
 
 As of October 25, 2024, approximately 2,700 cumulative LNG cargoes totaling over 185 million tonnes of LNG have been produced, loaded and exported from the Liquefaction Project. 
 
 Financial 
 
 In May 2024, CQP issued 1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.750 Senior Notes due 2034 (the 2034 CQP Senior Notes ). The net proceeds from the 2034 CQP Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used in June 2024 to retire 1.2 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 5.625 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the 2025 SPL Senior Notes ). 
 In May 2024, Moody s Ratings upgraded our issuer credit rating to Baa1 from Baa2 and revised our outlook to stable from positive. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid 150 million and 450 million, respectively, of outstanding aggregate principal amounts of our senior secured notes.

 Volumes loaded and recognized from the Liquefaction Project 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance LNG volumes loaded and recognized as revenues (in TBtu) 377 362 15 1,166 1,118 48 
 
 Net income 
 
 Net income declined by 128 million and 1.4 billion between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily as a result of unfavorable changes in fair value of derivatives of 215 million and 1.6 billion, respectively. The decline between periods was principally attributable to our IPM agreement with Tourmaline Oil Marketing Corp, which decreased from 217 million and 1.5 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to 32 million and 238 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to the nonrecurrence of significant declines of historic volatility in international gas prices and moderated and sustained spot prices during the current periods relative to the same periods of 2023. The remaining unfavorable changes in fair value of derivatives of 30 million and 352 million during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, were primarily due to an unfavorable shift in long-term U.S. natural gas forward prices. 
 
 Partially offsetting the aforementioned unfavorable changes between the three month periods was an increase in LNG revenues, net of cost of sales excluding the aforementioned changes in fair value of derivatives, of 49 million due to an increase in production volume compared to the same period of 2023. Partially offsetting the aforementioned unfavorable changes between the nine month periods was a decrease in interest expense of 81 million due to decrease in total indebtedness 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 and a decrease in operating and maintenance expense of 73 million due to reduced operating and maintenance activities compared to the same period of 2023. 
 The following is an additional discussion of the significant drivers of the variance in net income by line item: 
 Revenues 
 
 We had 74 million and 736 million decreases in revenues between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, which were primarily attributable to 137 million and 997 million decreases, respectively, from lower pricing per MMBtu as a result of decrease in revenues attributable to declining Henry Hub pricing, partially offset by 82 million and 287 million increases, respectively, from higher production volume largely due to reduced operating and maintenance activities compared to the same period of 2023 and cooler weather. 
 
 Operating costs and expenses 
 
 The increase in operating costs and expenses of 82 million and 715 million between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, was primarily attributable to 215 million and 1.6 billion unfavorable variances, respectively, over the same periods from changes in fair value of derivatives included in cost of sales, as discussed above under Net income . The unfavorable variances were partially offset by 125 million and 767 million decreases between the comparative three and nine month periods, respectively, in cost of sales excluding the effect of derivative changes, primarily as a result of 99 million and 661 million decreases, respectively, over the same periods in cost of natural gas feedstock, largely due to lower U.S. natural gas prices. 
 Other income (expense) 
 The 28 million and 82 million favorable variances between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, were primarily attributable to 24 million and 81 million decreases, respectively, in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, primarily due to decrease in total indebtedness. Total debt decreased from 12.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 to 8.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 as debt continued to be paid down as part of Cheniere s long-term capital allocation plan. 
 Significant factor affecting our results of operations 
 
 Below is a significant factor that affects our results of operations. 
 
 Gains and losses on derivative instruments 
 
 Derivative instruments are utilized to manage our exposure to commodity-related marketing and price risks and are reported at fair value on our Financial Statements. For commodity derivative instruments related to our IPM agreement, the underlying LNG sales being economically hedged are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting, whereby revenues expected to be derived from the future LNG sales are recognized only upon delivery or realization of the underlying transaction. Notwithstanding the operational intent to mitigate risk exposure over time, the recognition of derivative instruments at fair value has the effect of recognizing gains or losses relating to future period exposure, and given the significant volumes, long-term duration and volatility in price basis for certain of our derivative contracts, the use of derivative instruments may result in continued volatility of our results of operations based on changes in market pricing, counterparty credit risk and other relevant factors that may be outside of our control. For example, as described in Note 5 Derivative Instruments of our Notes to Financial Statements, the fair value of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives incorporates, as applicable, market participant-based assumptions pertaining to certain contractual uncertainties, including those related to the availability of market information for delivery points, which may require future development of infrastructure, as well as the timing of satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. We may recognize changes in fair value through earnings that could significantly impact our results of operations if and when such uncertainties are resolved.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The following information describes our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet our requirements in the short term and the long term. In the short term, we expect to meet our cash requirements using operating cash flows and available liquidity, consisting of restricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under our credit facility. Additionally, we expect to meet our long term cash requirements by using operating cash flows and other future potential sources of liquidity, which may include debt offerings. The table below provides a summary of our available liquidity (in millions). Future material sources of liquidity are discussed below. 
 September 30, 2024 Restricted cash and cash equivalents designated for the Liquefaction Project 
 80 Revolving Credit Facility (1) 
 766 Total available liquidity 846 
 
 (1) Available commitments represent total commitments less loans outstanding and letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. See Note 7 Debt of our Notes to Financial Statements for additional information on the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt instruments. 
 
 Our liquidity position subsequent to September 30, 2024 will be driven by future sources of liquidity and future cash requirements. For a discussion of our future sources and uses of liquidity, see the liquidity and capital resources disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 . 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions). The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, including accruals, which are referred to elsewhere in this report. Additional discussion of these items follows the table. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,987 1,971 Net cash used in investing activities (58) (129) Net cash used in financing activities (1,905) (1,899) Net increase (decrease) in restricted cash and cash equivalents 
 24 (57) 
 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 
 The 16 million increase between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was due to the net effect of price changes on our LNG sales and natural gas feedstock purchases between the respective periods, partially offset by lower cash flows attributed to working capital from differences in timing of payments to suppliers and cash collections from the sale of LNG cargoes. 

Investing Cash Flows 
 
 Cash outflows for property, plant and equipment during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily related to optimization and other site improvement projects.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Marketing and Trading Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We have commodity derivatives consisting of natural gas supply contracts for the operation of the Liquefaction Project (the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives ). In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives to changes in underlying commodity prices, management modeled a 10 change in the commodity price for natural gas for each delivery location as follows (in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fair Value Change in Fair Value Fair Value Change in Fair Value Liquefaction Supply Derivatives
