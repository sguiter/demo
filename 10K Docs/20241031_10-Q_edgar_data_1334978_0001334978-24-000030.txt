 On May 15, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the CCOH Board of Directors approved grants of million restricted stock units RSUs and million performance stock units PSUs to certain of its employees as part of those employees annual compensation. 
 The RSUs vest in equal installments on each of April 1, 2025, April 1, 2026 and April 1, 2027, provided that the recipient is still employed by, or providing services to, the Company on each such vesting date. 
 The PSUs vest and become earned based on the achievement of the Company s total shareholder return relative to the Company s peer group (the Relative TSR over a performance period commencing on April 1, 2024 and ending on March 31, 2027 (the Performance Period ). If the Company achieves Relative TSR at the 75 th percentile or higher, the PSUs will be earned at of the target number of shares; if the Company achieves Relative TSR at the 50 th percentile, the PSUs will be earned at of the target number of shares; if the Company achieves Relative TSR at the 25 th percentile, the PSUs will be earned at of the target number of shares; and if the Company achieves Relative TSR below the 25 th percentile, no PSUs will be earned. To the extent Relative TSR is between achievement levels, the portion of the PSUs that is earned will be determined using straight-line interpolation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the Company s absolute total shareholder return over the Performance Period is less than , the maximum payout shall not be greater than of the target number of shares. 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2012 Third Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the 2024 Plan ), which amends and restates the 2012 Second Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan. The 2024 Plan is a broad-based incentive compensation plan that provides for granting stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance-based cash and stock awards to any of the Company s or its subsidiaries present or future directors, officers, employees, consultants or advisors. 
 Effective May 31, 2024, certain executive officers of the Company received one-time PSU awards, totaling million in aggregate, which are eligible to vest and become earned shares in one-third increments based on achievement of specified stock price performance hurdles of , and during the period, beginning on May 31, 2024, subject to additional service-based vesting conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement. The maximum number of shares that may be earned with respect to these PSUs is of the PSUs granted. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had shares available for issuance under the 2024 Plan, assuming a 100 payout of the Company s outstanding performance stock units. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The Company tests its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may exceed the undiscounted cash flows they are expected to generate. When a long-lived asset or asset group is determined to be unrecoverable, its cost basis is reduced to reflect the current fair market value, and an impairment loss is recognized. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, in connection with the Company s ongoing sale process of its businesses in Latin America, the Company identified impairment indicators for the long-lived assets of several of its Latin American businesses (each of which is a separate asset group) and determined certain of these asset groups to be unrecoverable. The Company utilized a market approach to estimate the fair value of each asset group and reduced the carrying values of Structures, net, Other property, plant and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet accordingly, resulting in an impairment charge of million on the Consolidated Statement of Loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations MD A should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. All references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the Company, we, us and our refer to Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The MD A is organized as follows: 
 Overview Discussion of the nature, key developments and trends of our business in order to provide context for the remainder of this MD A. 
 Results of Operations Analysis of our financial results of operations at the consolidated and segment levels. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Analysis of our short- and long-term liquidity and discussion of our material cash requirements and the anticipated sources of funds needed to satisfy such requirements. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates Discussion of our material accounting estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty, which we believe are most important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our consolidated financial statements. 
 This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements contained at the end of this MD A. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Description of Our Business and Segments 
 Our revenue is derived from selling advertising space on the out-of-home displays that we own or operate in various markets using assorted digital and printed display types. We have four reportable business segments: America, which consists of our U.S. operations excluding airports; Airports, which includes revenue from U.S. and Caribbean airports; Europe-North, which consists of operations in the United Kingdom (the U.K. ), the Nordics and several other countries throughout northern and central Europe; and Europe-South, which consists of operations in Spain and, prior to their sales in 2023, also consisted of operations in Switzerland, Italy and France. Our remaining operations in Latin America, including in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Peru, and in Singapore are disclosed as Other. 
 Dispositions and Discontinued Operations 
 In 2023, we sold our businesses in Switzerland, Italy and France on March 31, May 31 and October 31, respectively. We have used the net proceeds from these sales, after payment of transaction-related fees and expenses, to improve liquidity and increase financial flexibility of the business as permitted under our debt agreements. 
 Additionally, in May 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell our business in Spain to a subsidiary of JCDecaux SE. Since that time and as of September 30, 2024, the transaction was expected to close in 2024. However, on October 28, 2024, the subsidiary of JCDecaux SE terminated the agreement after deciding to withdraw its regulatory filing with the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (the CNMC in light of the commitments required by the CNMC. 
 In aggregate, the sales of our businesses in Switzerland, Italy and France, along with the agreement to sell our business in Spain (collectively comprising our entire Europe-South segment), met the criteria for discontinued operations presentation during the third quarter of 2023. As a result, each of these businesses has been reclassified to discontinued operations in the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the remaining discussion in this MD A presents the results of continuing operations and excludes amounts related to discontinued operations. 
 International Sales Processes 
 In 2023, we initiated processes to sell our businesses comprising our Europe-North segment and our businesses in Latin America, which remain ongoing. There can be no assurance that these processes will result in any transactions or particular outcomes. We have not set a timetable for completion of these processes, may suspend the processes at any time and may decide not to make further announcements regarding the processes unless and until our Board of Directors approves a course of action for which further disclosure is appropriate.

 Macroeconomic Trends and Seasonality 
 As described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, global inflation increased over the last few years and has affected our results due to higher costs, particularly in our European businesses. In response to the heightened levels of inflation, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, raised interest rates significantly, resulting in an increase in our weighted average cost of debt. Although inflation remains elevated, it has slowed from the peak reached in 2022, and in September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates. However, future fluctuations in these economic indicators are uncertain. Our international results are also impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, but volatility did not have a significant impact on our reported results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The market risks that our business is subject to are further described in Item 3 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Additionally, our segment results are impacted by economic conditions in the specific markets and industries in which we operate as advertising revenue is highly correlated to, and has historically trended in line with, changes in gross domestic product. Certain of these trends have affected our financial results: 
 In 2023, we experienced weakness in revenue within certain of our larger U.S. markets, most notably those in California, as specific macroeconomic trends affecting these markets resulted in lower spend on out-of-home advertising. Also in 2023, demand for out-of-home advertising in Sweden was negatively impacted by an economic downturn in that country. Improved conditions in these markets, along with an increase in demand and digital deployments, have resulted in revenue growth in our America and Europe-North segments in 2024. 
 Continued growth in the travel industry has been a driver of strengthened performance in our Airports segment. As daily passenger volume through U.S. airports reached record-breaking levels in 2024, we have experienced strong revenue growth. 
 Due to seasonality, the results for this interim period are not indicative of expected results for the full year. We typically experience our weakest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, which is generally offset during the remainder of the year as our business typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. 
 Debt Activity 
 On March 18, 2024, we issued 865.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875 Senior Secured Notes Due 2030 (the CCOH 7.875 Senior Secured Notes and used a portion of the proceeds therefrom to prepay 835.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan Facility. At the same time, we amended our Senior Secured Credit Agreement to, among other things, refinance the 425.0 million remaining principal balance on the Term Loan Facility and to extend its maturity date from 2026 to 2028, subject to certain conditions. 
 On March 22, 2024, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Clear Channel International B.V. CCIBV ), entered into a credit agreement comprising two tranches of term loans (the CCIBV Term Loan Facility totaling an aggregate principal amount of 375.0 million , which mature in 2027, and used the proceeds therefrom to redeem all of the outstanding 6.625 Senior Secured Notes Due 2025 (the CCIBV Senior Secured Notes ). 
 Taken together, these transactions are referred to herein as the March 2024 Debt Transactions. Please refer to Note 5 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The discussion of our results of operations is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis. 
 Our operating segment profit measure is Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as revenue less direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding restructuring and other costs, which are defined as costs associated with cost-saving initiatives such as severance, consulting and termination costs and other special costs. 
 Corporate expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, other operating income and expense, all non-operating income and expenses, and income taxes are managed on a total company basis and are therefore included only in our discussion of consolidated results of continuing operations. 
 Results of discontinued operations are presented and discussed below separately from results of continuing operations.

 Revenue and expenses excluding the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates are presented in this MD A because Company management believes that viewing certain financial results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates facilitates period-to-period comparisons of business performance and provides useful information to investors. Revenue and expenses excluding the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates are calculated by converting the current period s revenue and expenses in local currency to U.S. dollars using average monthly foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year.

 Consolidated revenue increased 32.2 million, or 6.1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Excluding the 2.3 million impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue increased 29.9 million, or 5.7 . 
 Consolidated revenue increased 104.3 million, or 7.0 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Excluding the 5.0 million impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue increased 99.3 million, or 6.6 . 
 In both periods, these increases were driven by higher demand and our continued investment in digital infrastructure, with revenue growth across the America, Airports and Europe-North business segments.

Excluding the 2.8 million impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses increased 34.1 million, or 4.3 . 
 In both periods, site lease expense increased due to higher revenue, lower rent abatements and new contracts, but these increases were partially offset by the impact of certain contract losses and renegotiations.

 The remaining increase in consolidated direct operating expenses in both periods primarily resulted from higher property taxes, higher rental costs for additional digital displays, and higher production, installation and maintenance costs associated with revenue growth. 
 Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative SG A Expenses 
 Consolidated SG A expenses increased 12.8 million, or 14.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Excluding the 0.1 million impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG A expenses increased 12.7 million, or 14.6 . 
 Consolidated SG A expenses increased 25.1 million, or 9.4 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Excluding the 0.6 million impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG A expenses increased 24.6 million, or 9.2 . 
 In both periods, the largest driver of these increases was higher employee compensation costs, primarily due to higher variable-incentive compensation, pay increases and increased sales headcount. Additionally, property tax expense was lower in the prior year due to a legal settlement. 
 The following table provides the restructuring and other costs included within SG A expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Corporate Expenses 
 Corporate expenses increased 6.0 million, or 17.2 , and decreased 3.6 million, or 2.8 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. Excluding the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased 6.0 million, or 17.2 , and decreased 4.0 million, or 3.1 , during the three and nine-month periods, respectively. 
 In both periods, we incurred higher employee compensation costs, largely driven by insurance benefits and bonuses, and certain legal costs associated with property and casualty settlements. Such cost increases (excluding share-based compensation) totaled 4.3 million and 14.3 million during the three and nine-month periods, respectively. 
 During the nine-month period, these increased costs were more than offset by the impact of a 19.0 million legal liability recorded in the second quarter of 2023 for the resolution of the investigation of our former indirect, non-wholly-owned subsidiary, Clear Media Limited. Such expense is included in Restructuring and other costs in the table below.

 (1) Excludes share-based compensation expense for employees of discontinued operations. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 0.1 million, or 0.2 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization decreased 20.7 million, or 11.1 , compared to the same period of 2023, as certain structures became fully depreciated in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Impairment Charges 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not recognize any impairment charges. However, in the second quarter of 2024, we recognized impairment charges of 18.1 million related to long-lived assets within certain of our Latin American businesses. No impairment charges were recognized in 2023. 
 Other Operating Expense, Net 
 Other operating expense, net, decreased 2.5 million and 0.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 During the three-month period, the decrease was largely driven by lower transaction costs related to our international sales processes and other structural initiatives, which totaled 3.9 million and 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the nine-month period, we incurred higher transaction costs related to our international sales processes and other structural initiatives, which totaled 15.8 million and 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, but this increase in costs was offset by a gain on the disposition of certain assets in our America segment during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net, increased 7.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, due to higher average interest rates. However, lower interest rates following the March 2024 Debt Transactions led to a 0.4 million decrease in interest expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 4.8 million related to the March 2024 Debt Transactions, including 2.4 million related to the prepayment and amendment of the Term Loan Facility and 2.4 million related to the redemption of the CCIBV Senior Secured Notes. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of 3.8 million primarily related to our open market repurchases of 5.0 million principal amount of CCOH 7.750 Senior Notes and 10.0 million principal amount of CCOH 7.500 Senior Notes at a discount. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized other expense, net, of 0.7 million and 9.1 million, respectively, compared to other expense, net, of 17.3 million and other income, net, of 3.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The fluctuations in other income (expense), net, were largely driven by changes in net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 12.0 million of debt modification expense related to the March 2024 Debt Transactions, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 4.4 million of debt modification expense related to the CCOH 9.000 Senior Secured Notes issuance and Term Loan Facility prepayment completed in August 2023. 
 Income Tax Benefit Attributable to Continuing Operations 
 The effective tax rates for continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 10.8 and 3.4 , respectively, compared to 0.5 and 6.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for each period were primarily impacted by the valuation allowance recorded against current period deferred tax assets resulting from losses and interest expense carryforwards in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions due to uncertainty regarding the Company s ability to realize those assets in future periods.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity Analysis 
 Short-Term Liquidity 
 Our main cash requirements are for working capital used to fund the operations of the business, capital expenditures and debt service. We typically meet these requirements with cash on hand, internally-generated cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our credit facilities. We believe that our current sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
 Long-Term Liquidity 
 Our long-term future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the growth of our business, investments in digital conversions and new technologies, and the pursuit and outcome of strategic opportunities, including the ongoing processes to sell our businesses comprising our Europe-North segment and our businesses in Latin America. In addition, we have long-term cash requirements related to the repayment of our outstanding debt, which is scheduled to mature over the next six years. We believe that our sources of funds will be adequate to meet our cash requirements in the long-term. 
 However, our ability to meet these cash requirements through cash from operations will depend on our future operating results and financial performance, which are subject to significant uncertainty and may be affected by events beyond our control, including macro-economic events that may result in economic weakness globally or in certain specific markets, higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical events such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Additionally, our significant interest payment obligations reduce our financial flexibility, make us more vulnerable to changes in operating performance and economic downturns generally, and reduce our liquidity over time. 
 We regularly consider, and enter into discussions with our lenders and other parties related to, potential financing alternatives. In the future, we may need to obtain supplemental liquidity through additional financing from banks or other lenders; public offerings or private placements of debt, equity or equity-linked securities; strategic relationships or other arrangements; or from a combination of these sources. In addition, from time to time we have explored, and expect to continue to explore, a variety of transactions to improve our liquidity and/or to refinance our indebtedness. However, there can be no assurance that financing alternatives or liquidity-generating or debt-refinancing transactions will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future due to market conditions, our financial condition, our liquidity constraints or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Even if financing alternatives are available, we may not find them suitable or at reasonable interest rates, and the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from securing financing on terms that are available to us at that time or at all. 
 If we are unable to generate sufficient cash through our operations or obtain sources of supplemental liquidity as needed, we could face substantial liquidity problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on our ability to meet our obligations. 
 Cash Requirements 
 Working Capital Needs 
 We utilize working capital to fund the operations of our business and have certain related contractual obligations, including commitments under site leases and other non-cancelable contracts. 
 One of our largest cash requirements is for site lease costs, which includes payments for land or space used by our advertising displays for both lease and non-lease contracts, including minimum guaranteed payments and revenue-sharing arrangements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred site lease expense for our continuing operations of 596.9 million and 581.2 million, respectively, which is included within Direct operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Loss. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reduced our site lease expense for continuing operations by rent abatements of 5.9 million and 18.6 million, respectively.

 As disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in September 2023 we reached a settlement with the SEC regarding the resolution of the investigation of our former indirect, non-wholly-owned subsidiary, Clear Media Limited, in which we agreed to pay a total of approximately 26.1 million to the SEC in a series of installments. We paid 13.1 million in October 2023, and we made the remaining payments, totaling 13.1 million, in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions 
 We made the following capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (1) Capital expenditures for discontinued operations have decreased as the businesses in Switzerland, Italy and France were sold in 2023. 
 (2) In addition to payments that occurred during the period for capital expenditures, we had 11.3 million and 8.7 million of accrued capital expenditures related to continuing operations that remained unpaid as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.3 million and 3.5 million of accrued capital expenditures related to discontinued operations that remained unpaid as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (3) Excludes asset acquisitions. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we completed certain acquisitions of out-of-home advertising assets in our America segment for total cash consideration of 8.8 million and 12.1 million, respectively. These asset acquisitions primarily consisted of permits, permanent easements and digital billboard structures. 
 Additionally, in August 2024, we paid cash consideration of 9.3 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire the UIP group, a business that develops and operates urban infrastructure in Norway, including bike-sharing programs and bus shelters. 
 Debt Activity and Service Obligations 
 In accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, we were historically required to make principal payments on the Term Loan Facility of 5.0 million quarterly and, accordingly, made 10.0 million of such principal payments during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 
 In August 2023, we issued 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of CCOH 9.000 Senior Secured Notes, which mature in September 2028, and used a portion of the net proceeds to prepay 665.0 million of outstanding principal on the Term Loan Facility, which we repurchased at a 1 discount, satisfying the remaining quarterly payment obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. We paid debt issuance costs of 12.3 million related to these transactions. 
 In September 2023, we repurchased in the open market 5.0 million principal amount of the CCOH 7.750 Senior Notes and 10.0 million principal amount of the CCOH 7.500 Senior Notes for a total cash payment of 11.8 million, excluding accrued interest. The repurchased notes are held by a subsidiary of the Company and have not been cancelled. 
 In March 2024, we issued 865.0 million aggregate principal amount of CCOH 7.875 Senior Secured Notes, which mature in April 2030, and used a portion of the proceeds therefrom to prepay 835.0 million of the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. At the same time, we entered into an amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement to, among other things, refinance the 425.0 million remaining principal balance on the Term Loan Facility and to extend its maturity date from August 2026 to August 2028, subject to certain conditions. The new refinanced term loans were issued at a 1 discount, and we used the proceeds therefrom, along with the remaining proceeds from the CCOH 7.875 Senior Secured Notes issuance and cash on hand, to pay off the original term loans, to pay 14.9 million of accrued interest on the prepaid and refinanced Term Loan principal, and to pay 15.4 million of fees and expenses related to these transactions.

 In March 2024, CCIBV entered into the CCIBV Term Loan Facility totaling an aggregate principal amount of 375.0 million, which matures in April 2027. The CCIBV Term Loan Facility, which was issued at 1 discount, is comprised of two tranches of term loans: fixed rate term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 300.0 million that bear interest at 7.5 per annum, and floating rate term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 75.0 million that bear interest equal to Term SOFR plus 2.25 per annum (subject to a floor rate of 5.25 per annum). We used the proceeds from the CCIBV Term Loan Facility, along with cash on hand, to redeem all of the outstanding 375.0 million aggregate principal amount of CCIBV Senior Secured Notes, which were scheduled to mature in August 2025, and to pay 11.8 million of accrued interest related thereto and 5.1 million of related transaction fees and expenses. At September 30, 2024, we had an accrual of 0.8 million for unpaid fees and expenses related to these transactions. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid interest of 297.1 million and 283.7 million, respectively, with the increase primarily due to the timing of interest payments in connection with the issuance of the CCOH 9.000 Senior Secured Notes in August 2023 and the March 2024 Debt Transactions. We anticipate having cash interest payment obligations of approximately 137 million during the remainder of the year, including the first semi-annual interest payment on the CCOH 7.875 Senior Secured Notes, which was paid in October, and 420 million in 2025, assuming that we do not refinance or incur additional debt. 
 Our next debt maturities are in 2027 when the 1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of CCOH 5.125 Senior Secured Notes and the 375.0 million principal amount outstanding under the CCIBV Term Loan Facility become due. 
 Please refer to Note 5 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on our outstanding long-term debt. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our debt agreements. 
 Sources of Capital and Liquidity 
 Cash On Hand 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 201.1 million of cash on our balance sheet, including 56.0 million of cash held outside the U.S. by our subsidiaries (excluding cash held by our business in Spain, which is a discontinued operation). Excess cash from our foreign operations may generally be transferred to our operations in the U.S. if needed, subject to the foreseeable cash needs of our foreign operations and restrictions in the credit agreement governing the CCIBV Term Loan Facility. We could presently repatriate excess cash with minimal U.S. tax consequences, as calculated for tax law purposes, and dividend distributions from our international subsidiaries may not result in a U.S. federal income tax liability. 
 Cash Flow from Operations 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 50.5 million, a significant improvement from the net cash used for operating activities of 1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The return to positive operating cash flow was driven by the improvement of our underlying business performance and the disposal of certain of our former Europe-South businesses in 2023, which generated negative operating cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 This increased cash flow was partially offset by higher cash paid for interest, which increased 13.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the timing of interest payments, and 13.1 million of payments to the SEC related to the resolution of the Clear Media Limited matter, as previously described. 
 Dispositions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net cash proceeds from the disposition of assets of 12.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received net cash proceeds from the disposition of businesses and assets of 103.1 million, primarily related to the sales of our former businesses in Switzerland and Italy.

 Credit Facilities 
 We have access to a Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables-Based Credit Facility, both of which include sub-facilities for letters of credit and short-term borrowings and are scheduled to mature on August 23, 2026. The table below presents our borrowings and excess availability under these credit facilities as of September 30, 2024:

 (1) Effective August 23, 2024, the amount of revolving credit commitments available under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased from 150.0 million to 115.8 million, in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. The borrowing limit of the Receivables-Based Credit Facility is equal to the lesser of 175.0 million and the borrowing base, which is calculated based on our accounts receivable balance each period in accordance with our Receivables-Based Credit Agreement. 
 (2) Letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 included a 20.2 million letter of credit related to our former business in France. In connection with the sale of this business, and pursuant to the related share purchase agreement, our former French business and/or the buyer will either replace, or procure a counter-guarantee of, our payment obligation under the letter of credit. Letters of credit outstanding under the Receivables-Based Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 included a 6.6 million letter of credit related to our business in Spain. 
 (3) Due to rounding, the total may not equal the sum of the columns or the difference of the line items in the table above. 
 Senior Secured Credit Agreement Financial Covenant 
 The Senior Secured Credit Agreement contains a springing financial covenant, applicable solely to the Revolving Credit Facility if its balance is greater than 0 and undrawn letters of credit exceed 10 million, that requires compliance with a first lien leverage ratio of less than 7.10 to 1.00. Our first lien leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing first lien debt by EBITDA (as defined by the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) for the preceding four quarters , was 5.34 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2024. First lien debt and EBITDA, which both exclude discontinued operations, are presented herein because they are material components of the calculation of the first lien leverage ratio. 
 First Lien Debt

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires Company management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates, management's judgments and assumptions, and the potential effects if actual results differ from these assumptions that were disclosed in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except that the critical accounting estimate set forth under Goodwill is updated as follows: 
 Goodwill 
 We perform an impairment test on goodwill at least annually, as of July 1 of each year, and more frequently as events or changes in circumstances warrant. The discounted cash flow approach that we use for valuing goodwill as part of our impairment testing approach involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets, discounted to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value. Assessing the recoverability of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. 
 Our annual impairment test as of July 1, 2024 did not result in any impairment. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions: 
 Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the initial 4.5-year per iod were based on detailed, multi-year forecasts performed by each of our operating segments and reflected the advertising outlook across our businesses; 
 Cash flows were projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at 3.0 ; and 
 In order to risk-adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value, we utilized a discount rate for each of our reporting units rangin g from 10.0 to 15.0 . 
 Based on our assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 10 red uction in the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill would not have resulted in an impairment. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 The following table shows the decrease in the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill that would have resulted from decreases of 100 basis points in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and an increase of 100 basis points in our discount rate assumption as of July 1, 2024: 
 (In thousands) Revenue growth rate Profit margin Discount rate Decrease in fair value of reporting unit: 
 (100 basis point decrease) (1) 
 (100 basis point decrease) (1) 
 (100 basis point increase) (1)

 (78,147) (46,441) (62,156) Europe-North 
 (91,780) (63,528) (70,244) 
 (1) Changes to our assumptions by these amounts would not have resulted in goodwill impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit would still be greater than its carrying value. 
 There were no indicators of impairment as of September 30, 2024. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, the assumptions are not necessarily indicative of future results, and it is possible that a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. 
 
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains various forward-looking statements that represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including, without limitation, our guidance, outlook, long-term forecast, goals or targets; our business plans and strategies; the benefits of the sales of our European businesses; the termination of the agreement to sell our business in Spain and the consequences thereof; expectations about certain markets; the conduct of, and expectations about, international business sales processes; industry and market trends; and our liquidity. Statements expressing expectations and projections with respect to future matters are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We caution that these forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are subject to many variables that could impact our future performance. These statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management s expectations will necessarily come to pass. Actual future events and performance may differ materially from the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements. We do not intend, nor do we undertake any duty, to update any forward-looking statements. 
 A wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance, including, but not limited to: continued economic uncertainty, an economic slowdown or a recession; our ability to service our debt obligations and to fund our operations, business strategy and capital expenditures; the impact of our substantial indebtedness, including the effect of our leverage on our financial position and earnings; the difficulty, cost and time required to implement our strategy, including optimizing our portfolio, and the fact that we may not realize the anticipated benefits therefrom; our ability to obtain and renew key contracts with municipalities, transit authorities and private landlords; competition; regulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy, digital services, data protection and the use of artificial intelligence; a breach of our information security measures; legislative or regulatory requirements; restrictions on out-of-home advertising of certain products; environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations, as well as various actual and proposed environmental, social and governance policies, regulations and disclosure standards; the impact of the processes to sell our businesses comprising our Europe-North segment and our businesses in Latin America and any process to sell our business in Spain; the impact of the recent dispositions or agreements to dispose of the businesses in our Europe-South segment, including the impact of the termination of the agreement to sell our business in Spain, as well as other strategic transactions or acquisitions; third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us or our suppliers; risks of doing business in foreign countries; fluctuations in exchange rates and currency values; volatility of our stock price; the impacts on our stock price as a result of future sales of common stock, or the perception thereof, and dilution resulting from additional capital raised through the sale of common stock or other equity-linked instruments; our ability to continue to comply with the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange; the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness limiting our flexibility in operating our business; the effect of analyst or credit ratings downgrades; our dependence on our senior management team and other key individuals; continued scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders, customers, government regulators, municipalities, activists and other stakeholders; and certain other factors set forth in our other filings with the SEC. 
 This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation, which are generally interrelated. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We have operations in America, Europe, Singapore and Latin America. Foreign operations are measured in their local currencies, and as a result, our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported Segment Adjusted EBITDA for our Europe-North segment by 1.2 million and 1.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Our Europe-North segment reported Segment Adjusted EBITDA of 28.3 million and 75.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We estimate that a 10 increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased Europe-North Segment Adjusted EBITDA by 2.8 million and 7.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, while a 10 decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have increased Europe-North Segment Adjusted EBITDA by corresponding amounts. This analysis does not consider the implications that such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity in the U.S. or foreign countries or on the results of operations of the foreign entities comprising our Europe-North segment. 
 In 2023, we purchased a foreign currency exchange option to sell Euros and purchase U.S. Dollars to hedge the then anticipated proceeds from the sale of our business in Spain, which was expected to close in 2024. However, on October 28, 2024, a subsidiary of JCDecaux SE terminated the agreement to acquire the Company s business in Spain. On October 29, 2024, we unwound the aforementioned hedge and recouped the residual value of such instrument, less any fees related thereto. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as our Term Loan Facility, Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables-Based Credit Facility and a portion of our CCIBV Term Loan Facility bear interest at variable rates. At September 30, 2024, following the March 2024 Debt Transactions, variable-rate debt accounted for approximately 9 of our aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, a significant decrease from 22 as of December 31, 2023. 
 As described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates significantly in 2022 and 2023 in response to high levels of inflation, resulting in an increase to our weighted average cost of debt. However, the federal funds rate has generally remained steady since July 2023 and this, in combination with the lower proportion of variable-rate debt in our portfolio as a result of the March 2024 Debt Transactions, resulted in a slight decrease in our weighted average cost of debt from 7.5 at December 31, 2023 to 7.4 at September 30, 2024. In September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points. However, the scope for further cuts may be limited by inflation. 
 Generally, increases in interest rates adversely impact our reported results. Assuming the current level of borrowings and a 100 basis point increase in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, it is estimated that our interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased by 1.3 million and 3.8 million, respectively. If future increases in interest rates materially affect interest expense, Company management may take actions to mitigate our exposure. However, due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes no such actions. Further, the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Conversely, if future interest rates decline, Company management may take actions to capitalize on such movement. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation is a factor in the economies in which we do business, and we continue to seek ways to mitigate its effect. While inflation rates have slowed from the peak reached in 2022, global inflation remains high and, in the past, has affected our results due to higher costs for electricity, labor, rent, materials and equipment. Although the exact impact of inflation on our margins and earnings is indeterminable, we believe we have partially offset higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates for most of our out-of-home displays.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), under the supervision and with the participation of Company management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Amended and Restated Employment Agreement 
 On October 25, 2024, the Company and Jason A. Dilger, Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer of the Company, entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement ), which will be effective as of January 1, 2025. The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement supersedes the existing employment agreement between the Company and Mr. Dilger, dated January 1, 2022. 
 The initial term of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement ends on January 1, 2028, and will be automatically extended for additional three-year periods, unless the Company or Mr. Dilger delivers prior written notice of non-renewal of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement to the other party between June 1 and July 1 prior to the end of the then-applicable employment term. 
 Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, Mr. Dilger will (i) receive a base salary at an annualized rate of 435,000, (ii) be eligible to receive an annual performance bonus with a target of 65 of his annual base salary, and (iii) beginning in fiscal year 2025, be eligible to receive an annual equity incentive award with an approximate target value of 350,000 (but no less than 325,000), the form of which will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the CCOH Board of Directors, with such award to be granted under the Company s 2012 Second Amended and Restated Incentive Plan or any applicable successor plan, and subject to the applicable award agreement(s).

 In the event that the Company terminates Mr. Dilger s employment without Cause (as defined in the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement), or if the Company delivers notice of non-renewal of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, Mr. Dilger will receive any of his earned but unpaid annual bonus for the prior year, his accrued and unpaid base salary through the termination date, any unreimbursed business expenses incurred through the termination date and any payments required under applicable employee benefit plans. Further, subject to Mr. Dilger s timely execution and non-revocation of a severance agreement and general release of claims in favor of the Company in a form provided by and satisfactory to the Company, Mr. Dilger will receive the following: (a) continued payment of his base salary over the 12-month period following such date of termination; (b) payment of his annual bonus for the year in which such termination occurs, calculated based upon actual performance and prorated to reflect his period of employment during the applicable performance period through the date of such termination, payable at the same time as such bonuses are paid to other employees of the Company; and (c) Mr. Dilger s outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows: (i) any outstanding and unvested time-vesting equity awards scheduled to vest during the 12-month period following the date of termination will vest in full on the date of termination; and (ii) any outstanding and unvested performance-vesting equity awards will vest as follows: (A) one-third of the target number of shares underlying the performance stock units will be eligible to vest if the date of termination is before the date that is two years prior to the applicable vesting date, (B) two-thirds of the target number of shares underlying the performance stock units will be eligible to vest if the date of termination is on or after the date which is two years prior to the applicable vesting date, but before the date that is one year prior to the applicable vesting date, and (C) 100 of the target number of shares underlying the performance stock units will be eligible to vest if the date of termination is on or after the date that is one year prior to the applicable vesting date. The portion of the performance stock units eligible to vest in accordance with the foregoing will remain outstanding and eligible to be earned at the end of the applicable performance period based on the achievement of the applicable performance metrics as outlined in the applicable award agreement, and if earned, will be distributed to Mr. Dilger within 60 days. 
 In the event that Mr. Dilger delivers notice of non-renewal of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, Mr. Dilger will receive his accrued and unpaid base salary through the termination date, any unreimbursed business expenses incurred through the termination date and any payments required under applicable employee benefit plans, and in addition, if the termination date selected by the Company following delivery of such notice of non-renewal is before the end of the then-current employment term, subject to Mr. Dilger s timely execution and non-revocation of a severance agreement and general release of claims in favor of the Company in a form provided by and satisfactory to the Company, Mr. Dilger will receive an amount equal to his pro rata base salary through the end of the then-current employment term. 
 The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement also contains a customary perpetual confidentiality provision, as well as customary non-interference, non-solicitation and non-competition provisions that generally apply during employment and for the 12-month period thereafter. 
 The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.

The foregoing shall not affect Company s right to enforce the Non-Compete pursuant to Section 7.

22. MISCELLANEOUS 
 
 This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof for the period defined and, upon the Effective Date, supersedes and nullifies all prior or contemporaneous conversations, negotiations, or agreements (oral or written) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement and any term sheet referring to the terms herein. To the extent this Agreement has been executed prior to its Effective Date and other agreements are in place as of the date of execution, such other agreements remain in place until the Effective Date has been reached, and the terms of this Agreement shall not be in effect unless and until the Effective Date has been reached. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in writing signed by Employee and an authorized officer of the Company. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, a counterpart transmitted via electronic means, and all executed counterparts, when taken together, shall constitute sufficient proof of the parties entry into this Agreement. The parties agree to execute any further or future documents which may be necessary to allow the full performance of this Agreement. The failure of a party to require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the right of such party to later enforce any provision. A waiver of the breach of any term or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term or condition. If any provision of this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held unenforceable, such unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, except as specifically noted in this Agreement, or the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances, all of which shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law. Company and Employee agree that the restrictions contained in Section 4, 5, 6, 7, and 12 are material terms of this Agreement, reasonable in scope and duration and are necessary to protect Company s Confidential Information, goodwill, specialized training expertise, and legitimate business interests. If any restrictive covenant is held to be unenforceable because of the scope, duration or geographic area, the parties agree that the court or arbitrator may reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area, and in its reduced form, such provision shall be enforceable. Should Employee violate the provisions of Sections 5, 6, or 7 , then in addition to all other remedies available to Company, the duration of these covenants shall be extended for the period of time when Employee began such violation until Employee permanently ceases such violation. Employee agrees that no bond will be required if an injunction is sought to enforce any of the covenants previously set forth herein. Employee s employment during the Employment Period and for any period thereafter is at-will and may be terminated at any time by either party. To the extent that any subsequent agreement, plan or document applying or pertaining to Employee contains restrictive covenants of a similar nature and subject as those contained in Sections 5, 6 and or 7 of this Agreement, the Company and Employee hereby acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement shall prevail and control over such agreement, plan or document. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not control the meaning of any provision hereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to control or modify which Company entity is the Employee s legal employer for purposes of any laws or regulations governing the employment relationship. Employee acknowledges receipt of the Company s Employee Guide, Code of Conduct and other Company policies, including, without limitation, the Company s clawback policy (available on the Company s intranet website) and agrees to review and abide by their terms, which along with any other policy referenced in this Agreement may be amended from time to time at Company s discretion. Employee understands that Company policies do not constitute a contract between Employee and Company. Any conflict between such policies and this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of this Agreement. 
 
 14 

Upon full execution by all parties, this Agreement shall be effective on the Effective Date.
