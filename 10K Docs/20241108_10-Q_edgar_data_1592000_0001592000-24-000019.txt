We expect to recognize an additional million of interest expense out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) over the next twelve months. 
 
 Commodity Derivatives 
 
 We manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices by hedging the impact of market fluctuations by utilizing various over-the-counter and exchange-traded commodity financial instrument contracts. Commodity swaps and futures are used both to manage and hedge price and location risk related to these market exposures and to manage margins on offsetting fixed-price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of crude, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs. We do not designate commodity swaps or futures as cash flow or fair value hedges for hedge accounting treatment under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . Therefore, changes in the fair value of our derivatives are recorded in revenue in the period incurred. In addition, our commodity risk management policy does not allow us to take speculative positions with our derivative contracts. 
 
 We commonly enter into index (float-for-float) or fixed-for-float swaps in order to mitigate our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the future prices of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil. For natural gas, index swaps are used to protect against the price exposure of daily priced natural gas versus first-of-month priced natural gas. For condensate, crude oil, and natural gas, index swaps are also used to hedge the basis location price risk resulting from supply and markets being priced on different indices. Similarly, we use futures in order to mitigate our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the future prices of natural gas, crude, and condensate. For natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and crude oil, fixed-for-float swaps and futures are used to protect cash flows against price fluctuations: (1) where we receive a percentage of liquids as a fee for processing third-party natural gas or where we receive a portion of the proceeds of the sales of natural gas and liquids as a fee, (2) in the natural gas processing and fractionation components of our business and (3) where we are mitigating the price risk for product held in inventory or storage. 
 
 Assets and liabilities related to our derivative contracts are included in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities, and the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded net as a gain (loss) on derivative activity on the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the fair value of all of our derivative contracts based upon actively-quoted prices of the underlying commodities.

 On all transactions where we are exposed to counterparty risk, we analyze the counterparty s financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish limits, and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis. We primarily deal with financial institutions when entering into financial derivatives on commodities. We have entered into Master ISDAs that allow for netting of swap contract receivables and payables in the event of default by either party. Additionally, we have entered into FCDTCs that allow for netting of futures contract receivables and payables in the event of default by either party. If our counterparties failed to perform under existing commodity swap and futures contracts, the maximum loss on our gross receivable position of million as of September 30, 2024 would be reduced to million due to the offsetting of gross fair value payables against gross fair value receivables as allowed by the ISDAs and the FCDTCs.

power generators, transmission/distribution utility, retail electric provider, and natural gas defendants across over filed cases. On January 26, 2023, the court dismissed the claims against the pipeline and other natural gas-related defendants in the multi-district litigation, including EnLink Energy. The court s order was not appealed and the case is continuing without EnLink Energy and the other natural gas-related defendants. Subsequently, several suits were filed in February 2023 by individual plaintiffs (including one matter in which the plaintiffs seek to certify a class of Texas residents affected by Winter Storm Uri) and the alleged assignee of the claims of individual plaintiffs against approximately natural gas producers, pipelines, marketers, sellers, and traders, including EnLink Gas. The plaintiffs asserted claims of tortious interference, nuisance, and unjust enrichment against all defendants and are seeking economic and punitive damages and disgorgement of profits. EnLink Gas believes it has substantial defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously dispute these allegations and defend against such claims. 
 
 In addition, we are involved in various litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, any liabilities that may result from these claims would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may also be involved from time to time in the future in various proceedings in the normal course of business, including litigation on disputes related to contracts, property rights, property use or damage (including nuisance claims), personal injury, or the value of pipeline easements or other rights obtained through the exercise of eminent domain or common carrier rights.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Please read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In addition, please refer to the Definitions page set forth in this report prior to Part I Financial Information. 
 
 In this report, the terms Company or Registrant, as well as the terms ENLC, our, we, us, or like terms, are sometimes used as abbreviated references to EnLink Midstream, LLC itself or EnLink Midstream, LLC together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including ENLK and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Overview 
 
 ENLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2013. ENLC s assets consist of all of the outstanding common units of ENLK and all of the membership interests of the General Partner. All of our midstream energy assets are owned and operated by ENLK and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Our revenues and adjusted gross margins are generated from six primary sources: 
 
 gathering and transporting natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil on the pipeline systems we own; 
 processing natural gas at our processing plants; 
 fractionating and marketing recovered NGLs; 
 providing compression services; 
 providing crude oil and condensate transportation and terminal services; and 
 providing natural gas, crude oil, and NGL storage. 
 
 The following customers individually represented greater than 10 of our consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. No other customers represented greater than 10 of our consolidated revenues during the periods presented.

 CCS Business 
 
 We are continuing to work on building a carbon transportation business in support of CCS activity along the Gulf Coast, including the Mississippi River corridor in Louisiana, one of the highest CO 2 emitting regions in the United States. We believe that CCS remains an important solution to address carbon emissions by industrial emitters and that our existing asset footprint, including our extensive network of natural gas pipelines in Louisiana, our operating expertise, including our current operation of CCS pipelines in North Texas, and our customer relationships, provide us with an advantage in building a carbon transportation business and becoming a transporter of choice in the regions in which we operate.

 Recent Developments Affecting Industry Conditions and Our Business 
 
 Current Market Environment 
 
 There has been, and we believe there will continue to be, volatility in commodity prices and in the relationships among NGL, crude oil, and natural gas prices. The table below presents selected average index prices for crude oil, NGL, and natural gas for the periods indicated.

 (3) Weighted average NGL closing prices based on the OPIS Napoleonville daily average spot liquids prices. 
 (4) Natural gas closing prices based on Henry Hub Natural Gas Daily closing prices. 
 
 Competition for crude oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGL supplies and any decrease in the availability of such commodities, volatile prices, and market demand for crude oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs that are beyond our control could each adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows. For more information, see Item 1A Risk Factors Business and Industry Risks in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Commission on February 21, 2024. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 In recent years, U.S. inflation has increased significantly. In order to reduce the inflation rate, the Federal Reserve increased its target for the federal funds rate (the benchmark for most interest rates) several times in 2023. Inflation has moderated in 2023 and throughout 2024. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points and indicated the possibility of further rate cuts before the end of 2024. 
 
 To the extent that a rising cost environment impacts our results, there are typically offsetting benefits either inherent in our business or that result from other steps we take proactively to reduce the impact of inflation on our net operating results. These benefits include: (1) provisions included in our long-term fee-based revenue contracts that offset cost increases in the form of rate escalations based on positive changes in the U.S. Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or other factors; (2) provisions in our contracts that enable us to pass through higher costs to customers; and (3) higher commodity prices, which generally enhance our results in the form of increased volumetric throughput and demand for our services. For these reasons, the increased cost environment, caused in part by inflation, has not had a material impact on our historical results of operations for the periods presented in this report. However, a significant or prolonged period of high inflation could adversely impact our results if costs were to increase at a rate greater than the increase in the revenues we receive.

 Regulatory Developments 
 
 In accordance with the requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, on January 26, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA published its proposed rule regarding the Waste Emissions Charge, applicable to excess methane emissions at certain crude oil and natural gas facilities. Further, On March 8, 2024, the EPA published its final rules imposing new, stricter requirements for methane monitoring, reporting, and emissions control at certain crude oil and natural gas facilities. Finally, on April 10, 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management published its final Waste Prevention Rule, which requires operators of crude oil and natural gas leases to take reasonable steps to avoid natural gas waste, as well as develop leak detection, repair, and waste minimization plans. 
 
 Any regulatory changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. For more information, see our risk factors under Item 1A Risk Factors Environmental, Legal Compliance, and Regulatory Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Commission on February 21, 2024. 

Other Recent Developments 
 
 GIP/ONEOK Transaction 
 
 On October 15, 2024, GIP and ONEOK closed a transaction pursuant to which ONEOK acquired (i) 43.8 of the outstanding ENLC common units, consisting of 97,207,538 ENLC common units from GIP Stetson I and 103,133,215 ENLC common units from GIP Stetson II, in exchange for consideration equal to 14.90 in cash per common unit and (ii) all of the outstanding limited liability company interests in the Managing Member from GIP Stetson I in exchange for 300.0 million in cash, for a total cash consideration of approximately 3.285 billion . As a result of the GIP/ONEOK Transaction, ONEOK acquired control of the operations of ENLC and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Organic Growth 
 
 Henry Hub to the River Project. In 2024, we plan to expand the natural gas transmission capacity of the Bridgeline pipeline from the Henry Hub to the Mississippi River Corridor by 210 MMcf/d through additional compression. We expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of 2025. 
 
 Jefferson Island Storage Facility Expansion . We plan to expand the Jefferson Island storage facility by approximately 8 Bcf, which will increase the estimated working gas storage capacity from 2 Bcf to 10 Bcf. We expect to complete the Jefferson Island storage facility expansion in 2028. 
 
 Tiger II Processing Plant. In April 2023, we began moving equipment and facilities associated with the non-operational Cowtown processing plant in North Texas to our Delaware Basin JV operations in the Permian to operate as the Tiger II processing plant. The move has been completed and the Tiger II processing plant began operations in May 2024, which increased our Permian Basin processing capacity by 150 MMcf/d. 
 
 GCF Operations . In January 2023, we and our partners started the process to restart the GCF assets. We expect the assets to become operational in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Matterhorn JV. We own a 15 interest in the Matterhorn JV. The Matterhorn JV is constructing a pipeline designed to transport up to 2.5 Bcf/d of natural gas through approximately 490 miles of 42-inch pipeline from the Waha Hub in West Texas to Katy, Texas (the Matterhorn Express Pipeline ). The Matterhorn Express Pipeline began in-service operations in the third quarter of 2024.

 Exxon Mobil Agreement. In October 2022, we entered into a transportation services agreement with a subsidiary of ExxonMobil in connection with the development of a CCS project in southeastern Louisiana at Pecan Island in Vermilion Parish. In February 2024, we and ExxonMobil agreed to reassess the Pecan Island project s near-term role with the expectation that other joint CCS opportunities along the Gulf Coast might be prioritized ahead of the Pecan Island Project. Since that time, we and ExxonMobil have been unable to identify alternative CO 2 transportation projects for EnLink. We are now pursuing a financial arrangement for the value to EnLink of the Pecan Island transportation agreement. There can be no assurance that we would recover the value to EnLink of the Pecan Island transportation agreement in any financial arrangement or when such arrangement would be realized. 
 
 Debt 
 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 
 On August 15, 2024, ENLC completed the sale of 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of ENLC s 5.650 senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2034 (the 2034 Notes at 99.618 of their face value. Interest on the 2034 Notes is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on March 1, 2025. ENLC used the net proceeds for general limited liability company purposes, including to repay the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and a portion of the borrowings under the AR Facility. A portion of these borrowings were incurred to purchase outstanding Series B Preferred Units on August 5, 2024. The 2034 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ENLK. 
 
 Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased a portion of the 2044 Notes, the 2045 Notes, and the 2047 Notes in open market transactions. As a result, we recognized a 9.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, which is included in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We did not repurchase any senior unsecured notes in open market transactions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Equity 
 
 Preferred Unit Activity 
 
 In July 2024, the holders of the Series B Preferred Units exchanged 8,695,654 Series B Preferred Units for 10,000,000 ENLC common units. 
 
 In August 2024, we repurchased 12,698,414 Series B Preferred Units for 200.0 million plus accrued distributions. The repurchase price represented 105 of the preferred units par value. 
 
 In August 2024, we repurchased 5,000 Series C Preferred Units for total consideration of 5.0 million plus accrued distributions. The repurchase price represented 100 of the preferred units par value. 
 
 On October 17, 2024, we redeemed all of the outstanding Series C Preferred units for 1,000 per Series C Preferred Unit, plus 8.28 per Series C Preferred Unit of unpaid distributions. 
 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 7 for more information regarding the exchanges and repurchase of the Series B Preferred Units and the repurchase and redemption of the Series C Preferred Units. 
 
 Common Unit Repurchase Program. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,906,780 outstanding common units in open market purchases, for an aggregate cost, including commissions, of 25.0 million, or an average of 13.09 per common unit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 6,108,742 outstanding common units in open market purchases, for an aggregate cost, including commissions, of 79.0 million, or an average of 12.93 per common unit. 
 
 GIP Repurchase Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,718,847 ENLC common units held by GIP for an aggregate cost of 22.9 million, or an average of 13.31 per common unit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 6,862,179 ENLC common units held by GIP for an aggregate cost of 87.5 million, or an average of 12.75 per common unit.

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, on October 2, 2024, we repurchased 1,562,279 ENLC common units held by GIP at an aggregate cost of 20.4 million, or an average of 13.07 per common unit. These units represented GIP s pro rata share of the aggregate number of common units repurchased by us during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The per unit price we paid to GIP was the same as the average per unit price paid by us for publicly held ENLC common units repurchased during the same period, less broker commissions, which were not paid with respect to the ENLC common units held by GIP. As of September 30, 2024, 20.4 million is classified as Other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets related to our obligation to repurchase our common units from GIP. 
 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 8 for more information regarding our common unit repurchase activity. 
 
 Rate Reset 
 
 Beginning March 2024, certain legacy contracts in the Oklahoma and North Texas segments experienced a one-time rate reset. The rate reset was negotiated in 2018 in exchange for adding an additional five years of term to these contracts. The rate reset is a one-time adjustment down to a pre-negotiated rate (which partially reverses recent annual inflation cost escalation adjustments). These contracts are set to expire between 2029 and 2033 and continue to have cost escalation provisions that allow for rate increases from the reset rate based on future changes in inflation. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To assist management in assessing our business, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross margin; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow after distributions. 

Adjusted Gross Margin 
 
 We define adjusted gross margin as revenues less cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization. We disclose adjusted gross margin in addition to gross margin as defined by GAAP because it is the primary performance measure used by our management to evaluate consolidated operations. We believe adjusted gross margin is an important measure because, in general, our business is to gather, process, transport, or market natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and crude oil for a fee or to purchase and resell natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and crude oil for a margin. Operating expense is a separate measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of field operations. Direct labor and supervision, property insurance, property taxes, repair and maintenance, utilities, and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. We exclude all operating expenses and depreciation and amortization from adjusted gross margin because these expenses are largely independent of the volumes we transport or process and fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted gross margin is gross margin. Adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, gross margin as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted gross margin has important limitations because it excludes all operating expenses and depreciation and amortization that affect gross margin. Our adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other entities may not calculate these amounts in the same manner. 
 
 The following table reconciles total revenues and gross margin to adjusted gross margin (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total revenues 1,608.4 1,746.2 4,807.4 5,043.8 Cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization (1,067.6) (1,244.7) (3,280.6) (3,535.6) Operating expenses (134.0) (143.3) (441.8) (412.5) Depreciation and amortization (186.1) (163.8) (514.0) (489.5) Gross margin 220.7 194.4 571.0 606.2 Operating expenses 134.0 143.3 441.8 412.5 Depreciation and amortization 186.1 163.8 514.0 489.5 Adjusted gross margin 540.8 501.5 1,526.8 1,508.2

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (less) interest expense, net of interest income; depreciation and amortization; impairments; (income) loss from unconsolidated affiliate investments; distributions from unconsolidated affiliate investments; (gain) loss on disposition of assets; (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; (gain) loss on litigation settlement; unit-based compensation; income tax expense (benefit); unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives; costs associated with the relocation of processing facilities; accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations; transaction costs; non-cash expense related to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; (non-cash rent); and (non-controlling interest share of adjusted EBITDA from joint ventures). Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used in our short-term incentive program for compensating employees. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental liquidity and performance measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others, to assess: 
 
 the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; 
 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness, and make cash distributions to our unitholders; 
 our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing methods or capital structure; and 
 the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. 
 
 The GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense, net of interest income; income tax expense (benefit); and depreciation and amortization. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate cash available for distribution. Because we have capital assets, depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs. Therefore, any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP, as well as adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our overall performance.

 Free Cash Flow After Distributions 
 
 We define free cash flow after distributions as adjusted EBITDA, net to ENLC, plus (less) (growth and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities); (interest expense, net of interest income); (distributions declared on common units); (cash distributions earned by the Series B Preferred Units and the Series C Preferred Units); (payment to redeem mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest); (costs associated with the relocation of processing facilities, excluding costs that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities); non-cash interest (income)/expense; (contributions to investment in unconsolidated affiliates); (payments to terminate interest rate swaps); (current income taxes); (earnout payments related to the Amarillo Rattler Acquisition and the Central Oklahoma Acquisition); (non-cash gain associated with a lease modification); and proceeds from the sale of equipment and land. 
 
 Free cash flow after distributions is the principal cash flow metric used by the Company. It is also used as a supplemental liquidity measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others, to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, pay back our indebtedness, make cash distributions, and make capital expenditures. 
 
 Growth capital expenditures generally include capital expenditures made for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our asset base, operating income, or operating capacity over the long term. Examples of growth capital expenditures include the acquisition of assets and the construction or development of additional pipeline, storage, well connections, gathering, processing assets, or CCS initiatives, in each case, to the extent such capital expenditures are expected to expand our asset base, operating capacity, or our operating income. 
 
 Maintenance capital expenditures include capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and to extend their useful lives. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to refurbish and replace pipelines, gathering assets, well connections, compression assets, and processing assets up to their original operating capacity, to maintain pipeline and equipment reliability, integrity, and safety, and to address environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow after distributions is net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow after distributions should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow after distributions has important limitations because it excludes some items that affect net income (loss), operating income (loss), and net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow after distributions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate this non-GAAP metric in the same manner. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net cash provided by operating activities determined under GAAP, as well as free cash flow after distributions, to evaluate our overall liquidity.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues and Cost of Sales, Exclusive of Operating Expenses and Depreciation and Amortization. 
 
 Our consolidated and segment revenues and cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization, are from natural gas, NGL, crude oil, and condensate product sales and purchases, midstream services that we perform with respect to those commodities, and derivative activity. Fluctuations in our consolidated and segment revenues and cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization, reflect in large part changes in commodity prices and volumes. Our adjusted gross margin is not directly affected by the commodity price environment because the commodities that we buy and sell are generally based on the same pricing indices. Both consolidated and segment product sales revenues and cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate with market prices; however, the adjusted gross margin related to those sales and purchases will not necessarily have a corresponding increase or decrease. Additionally, fluctuations in these measures from changes in commodity prices may be offset by gains or losses from derivative instruments that we use to manage our exposure to commodity price risk associated with such sales and purchases. 
 
 Total revenues and cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization, decreased 137.8 million and 177.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the following: 
 
 Product sales revenues decreased 195.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 A 127.5 million decrease in natural gas sales primarily driven by lower natural gas prices; and 
 An 82.4 million decrease in NGL sales primarily driven by lower NGL volumes. 
 
 These decreases were partially offset by a 13.2 million increase in crude oil and condensate sales primarily driven by an 84.3 million increase in our Permian segment, which was primarily driven by higher volumes, and was partially offset by a 78.0 million decrease in our Louisiana segment, driven by the divestiture of our ORV crude assets in November 2023. 
 
 The changes in natural gas, NGL, and crude oil prices also had a corresponding impact to cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization, contributing to the 177.1 million decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Revenues from midstream services increased 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 32.2 million increase in gathering and transportation revenues primarily driven by higher gathering and transportation volumes in our Permian segment. 
 
 This increase was partially offset by: 
 
 A 7.3 million decrease in processing revenues primarily due to a 6.1 million decrease in our North Texas segment, which was driven by a one-time rate reset to a lower fee on certain existing contracts; 
 A 4.8 million decrease in NGL service revenues primarily driven by lower NGL service volumes; and 
 A 5.1 million decrease in crude services revenues primarily driven by the divestiture of our ORV crude assets. 
 
 Derivative gains increased 43.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to 2.9 million of increased realized gains and 40.9 million of increased unrealized gains. 
 
 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses decreased 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 7.0 million decrease in our Louisiana segment, driven by the divestiture of our ORV assets in November 2023.

 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 25.8 million increase related to changes in estimated useful lives of certain assets and a 5.3 million increase resulting from additional assets being placed in service. These increases were partially offset by a 6.1 million decrease related to assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives and a 2.9 million decrease due to the divestiture of our ORV assets in November 2023.

Analysis of Operating Segments 
 
 We manage and report our operations primarily according to the geography and the nature of the activity. We have five reportable segments: Permian segment, Louisiana segment, Oklahoma segment, North Texas segment, and Corporate segment. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on segment profit and adjusted gross margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to segment profit and adjusted gross margin is gross margin. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses to evaluate segment results. 
 
 See below for our discussion of segment results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Permian Segment. 
 
 Revenues and cost of sales, exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization, decreased 29.4 million and 70.6 million, respectively, resulting in an increase in adjusted gross margin in the Permian segment of 41.2 million, due to: 
 
 A 39.4 million increase in adjusted gross margin associated with our Permian natural gas assets. Adjusted gross margin, excluding derivative activity, increased 27.1 million, which was primarily due to higher volumes from existing customers. Derivative activity associated with our Permian natural gas assets increased adjusted gross margin by 12.3 million, which included 2.3 million from increased realized gains and 10.0 million from increased unrealized gains; and 
 A 1.8 million increase in adjusted gross margin associated with our Permian crude assets. Adjusted gross margin, excluding derivative activity, decreased 3.7 million, which was primarily due to lower commodity prices. Derivative activity associated with our Permian crude assets increased adjusted gross margin by 5.5 million from increased realized gains. 
 
 Operating expenses in the Permian segment increased 1.0 million due to an increase in operating activity. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization in the Permian segment increased 4.6 million primarily due to additional assets being placed in service.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 146.0 million primarily due to the following: 
 
 Gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, non-cash commodity derivative activity, utility credits redeemed, and unit-based compensation, decreased 27.1 million. The decrease in gross margin is due to a 30.8 million increase in operating expenses, excluding utility credits redeemed or earned and unit-based compensation, and was partially offset by a 3.7 million increase in adjusted gross margin, excluding non-cash commodity derivative activity. For more information regarding the changes in gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, see Results of Operations. 
 
 General and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation, increased 25.3 million. 
 
 Changes in working capital decreased net cash provided by operating activities by 100.6 million primarily due to fluctuations in trade receivable and payable balances due to timing of collection and payments, changes in inventory balances attributable to normal operating fluctuations, and fluctuations in accrued revenue and accrued purchases.

 Capital Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the following table summarizes our expected remaining capital requirements for 2024 (in millions): 
 
 Capital expenditures, net to ENLC (1) 138 
 ____________________________ 
 (1) Excludes capital expenditures that are contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities. 
 
 Our primary remaining capital projects for 2024 include the continued development of our existing systems through well connects and other low-cost development projects. We expect to fund our remaining 2024 capital requirements from operating cash flows. 
 
 It is possible that not all of our planned projects will be commenced or completed. Our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders, to fund planned capital expenditures, to make contributions to unconsolidated affiliate investments, and to make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the industry, financial, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024.

 ____________________________ 
 (1) The interest payable related to the Revolving Credit Facility and the AR Facility is not reflected in the table because such amounts depend on the outstanding balances and interest rates of the Revolving Credit Facility and the AR Facility, which vary from time to time. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 5 for more information regarding the Revolving Credit Facility and the AR Facility. 
 (2) The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration for the Amarillo Rattler Acquisition and the Central Oklahoma Acquisition was calculated in accordance with the fair value guidance contained in ASC 820. There are a number of assumptions and estimates factored into these fair values and actual contingent consideration payments could differ from these estimated fair values. 
 (3) Relates to the repurchase of ENLC common units held by GIP on October 2, 2024. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 8 for more information. 
 (4) See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 7 for more information regarding the redemption of the Series C Preferred Units. 
 (5) Consists of pipeline capacity payments for firm transportation and deficiency agreements. 
 
 The above table does not include any physical or financial contract purchase commitments for natural gas and NGLs due to the nature of both the price and volume components of such purchases, which vary on a daily or monthly basis. Additionally, we do not have contractual commitments for fixed price and/or fixed quantities of any material amount that is not already disclosed in the table above. 
 
 Our contractual cash obligations for the next twelve months are expected to be funded from cash flows generated from our operations and the available capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility or other debt sources.

 Indebtedness 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings and 14.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 AR Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the AR Facility had a borrowing base of 383.3 million and there were 260.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility, which is scheduled to terminate on August 1, 2025 and is classified as Current maturities of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the AR Facility, certain subsidiaries of ENLC sold and contributed, and will continue to sell or contribute, their accounts receivable to the SPV to be held as collateral for borrowings under the AR Facility. The SPV s assets are not available to satisfy the obligations of ENLC or any of its affiliates. 
 
 Senior Unsecured Notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior unsecured notes maturing from 2025 to 2047, of which 421.6 million relates to the 2025 Notes that mature on June 1, 2025 and is classified as Current maturities of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Guarantees. The amounts outstanding on our senior unsecured notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed in full by our subsidiary ENLK, including 105 of any letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. ENLK s guarantees of these amounts are full, irrevocable, unconditional, and absolute, and cover all payment obligations arising under the senior unsecured notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. Liabilities under the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of ENLK. 
 
 ENLC s assets consist of all of the outstanding common units of ENLK and all of the membership interests of the General Partner. Other than these equity interests, all of our assets and operations are held by our non-guarantor operating subsidiaries. ENLK, directly and indirectly, owns all of these non-guarantor operating subsidiaries, which in some cases are joint ventures that are partially owned by a third party. As a result, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of ENLK are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, ENLC records, on a stand-alone basis, transactions that do not occur at ENLK, which are primarily related to the taxation of ENLC and the elimination of intercompany borrowings.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk is the risk related to changes in the prices of natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and crude oil. In addition, we are also exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates on floating rate debt and equity. 

Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We are also subject to direct risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices. While approximately 90 of our adjusted gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was generated from arrangements with fee-based structures with minimal direct commodity price exposure, the remainder is subject to more direct commodity price exposure. Our exposure to these commodity price fluctuations is primarily in the natural gas processing component of our business. For more information regarding our main types of contractual arrangements, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Commission on February 21, 2024. 
 
 Our primary commodity risk management objective is to reduce volatility in our cash flows. We maintain a risk management committee, including members of senior management, which oversees all hedging activity. We enter into hedges for natural gas, crude and condensate, and NGLs using OTC derivative financial instruments with only certain well-capitalized counterparties, which have been approved in accordance with our commodity risk management policy. 
 
 We have hedged our exposure to fluctuations in prices for natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil volumes produced for our account. We have tailored our hedges to generally match the product composition and the delivery points to those of our physical equity volumes. The hedges cover specific products based upon our expected equity composition. 
 
 Commodity derivatives are used both to manage and hedge price and location risk related to these market exposures and to manage margins on offsetting fixed-price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of NGLs, natural gas, crude, and condensate.

 Another price risk we face is the risk of mismatching volumes of natural gas bought or sold on a monthly price versus volumes bought or sold on a daily price. We enter each month with a balanced book of natural gas bought and sold on the same basis. However, it is normal to experience fluctuations in the volumes of natural gas bought or sold under either basis, which leaves us with short or long positions that must be covered. We use financial swaps to mitigate the exposure at the time it is created to maintain a balanced position. 
 
 The use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances when (1) sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments or (2) counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market. However, we are similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding commodity derivative instruments had a net fair value asset of 9.5 million. The aggregate effect of a hypothetical 10 change, increase or decrease, in natural gas, crude and condensate, and NGL prices would result in a change of approximately 13.1 million in the net fair value of these contracts as of September 30, 2024. 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk on the Revolving Credit Facility and the AR Facility. Amounts drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility and the AR Facility bear interest at rates based on SOFR. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and 260.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility. 
 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 In January 2023, we entered into a 400.0 million interest rate swap to reduce the variability of cash outflows associated with our floating rate, SOFR-based borrowings, including borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and the AR Facility. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 9 for more information on our outstanding derivatives. 
 
 A 1.0 increase or decrease in interest rates would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 2.6 million for the AR Facility, based on our outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024. This change in interest expense would be offset by a 4.0 million change in the opposite direction due to our open interest rate swap hedge. 
 
 We are not exposed to changes in interest rates with respect to ENLK s senior unsecured notes due in 2025, 2026, 2044, 2045, or 2047 or our senior unsecured notes due in 2028, 2029, 2030, and 2034 as these are fixed-rate obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the senior unsecured notes was approximately 4,649.9 million, based on the market prices of ENLK s and our publicly traded debt at September 30, 2024. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 1.0 in interest rates. Such an increase in interest rates would result in an approximate 254.5 million decrease in fair value of the senior unsecured notes at September 30, 2024. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 5 for more information on our outstanding indebtedness. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 a. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management of the Managing Member is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for us. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Managing Member, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report (September 30, 2024), our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 
 b. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are involved in various litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. For a discussion of certain litigation and similar proceedings, please refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference herein. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Commission on February 21, 2024. The risks described in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not our only risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. 
 
 We have added the following risk factors related to the GIP/ONEOK Transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 ONEOK owns 43.8 of ENLC s outstanding common units as of October 15, 2024 and controls the Managing Member, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our Managing Member and its affiliates, including ONEOK, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties to us and may favor their own interests to your detriment. 
 
 ONEOK owns and controls the Managing Member and appoints all of the directors of the Managing Member. Some of the directors of the Managing Member, including directors with a majority of voting power, are also directors and/or officers of ONEOK. Although the Managing Member has a duty to manage us in a manner it subjectively believes to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, the directors and officers of the Managing Member also have a duty to manage the Managing Member in a manner that is in the best interests of ONEOK, in its capacity as the sole member of the Managing Member. Conflicts of interest may arise between ONEOK and its affiliates, including the Managing Member, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, the Managing Member may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations: 
 
 neither our operating agreement nor any other agreement requires ONEOK to pursue a business strategy that favors us or to enter into any commercial or business arrangement with us. ONEOK s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the stockholders of ONEOK, which may be contrary to our interests; 
 
 ONEOK may be constrained by the terms of its debt instruments from taking actions, or refraining from taking actions, that may be in our best interests; 
 
 the Managing Member determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional membership interests and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available to be distributed to unitholders; 
 
 the Managing Member determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by us; 
 
 the Managing Member is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us in exercising certain rights under our operating agreement; 
 
 our operating agreement limits the liability of, and eliminates and replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by, the Managing Member and also restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the provisions of the operating agreement, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty; 
 
 any future contracts between us, on the one hand, and ONEOK or its subsidiaries, on the other, may not be the result of arm s-length negotiations; 
 
 except in limited circumstances, the Managing Member has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval; 
 
 62 

Table of Contents 

the Managing Member may exercise its right to call and purchase all of ENLC s outstanding common units not owned by it and its affiliates if it and its affiliates own more than 90 of ENLC s outstanding common units; 
 
 the Managing Member controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by the Managing Member and its affiliates, including commercial agreements; and 
 
 the Managing Member decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants, or others to perform services for us. 
 
 ONEOK is not limited in its ability to compete with us and is not obligated to offer us the opportunity to acquire additional assets or businesses, which could limit our ability to grow and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 
 
 ONEOK is a midstream operator that provides gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, and storage services, with significant resources and experience in the midstream industry. ONEOK is not prohibited from owning assets or interests in entities, or engaging in businesses, that compete directly or indirectly with us. In addition, ONEOK and its subsidiaries may acquire, construct, or dispose of additional midstream or other assets and may be presented with new business opportunities, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct such assets or to engage in such business opportunities. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to the Managing Member, or any of its affiliates, including ONEOK and its officers. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any unitholder for breach of any duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself. 
 
 ONEOK has stated that it intends to pursue an acquisition of the remaining ENLC common units not held by it (a Public Unit Transaction ). There is no assurance that ONEOK s pursuit of a Public Unit Transaction will result in a definitive agreement or, if a definitive agreement is executed, that a Public Unit Transaction will be consummated. 
 
 As disclosed in the Schedule 13D with respect to ENLC filed by ONEOK with the Commission on October 15, 2024 upon the consummation of the GIP/ONEOK Transaction, ONEOK intends to pursue the acquisition of the remaining publicly held ENLC common units in a tax-free transaction and expects to discuss the terms of such potential transaction with the conflicts committee of the Board. There is no assurance that ONEOK s pursuit of a Public Unit Transaction will result in a definitive agreement with respect thereto or, if a definitive agreement is executed, that a Public Unit Transaction will be consummated.
